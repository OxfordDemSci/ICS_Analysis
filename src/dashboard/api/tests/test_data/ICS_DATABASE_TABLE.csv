###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at DMU into the design of clinically meaningful and technically robust quality measures for NHS maternity and perinatal services in Britain has led to: \(1\) better care outcomes for women and babies, including reductions in maternal haemorrhage and 3rd/4th degree tear rates, \(2\) improved maternity data capture and quality for comparative purposes nationally and internationally, \(3\) increased awareness of unexplained geographical variation in maternity care outcomes, which has driven quality improvement strategies, \(4\) integration of research\-based clinical measures into data strategies of the NHS and changes to regulatory and policy processes for maternity care.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Most women giving birth in the UK receive a safe, effective service. However, the stillbirth rate is higher in the UK than in many European countries. There is evidence of significant variation in maternity care outcomes between NHS Trusts in different regions, which has led to concerns over a postcode care lottery for women and babies. 

 Research led by Harris at DMU has used novel methods to identify geographical variations in maternal and perinatal care so that unwarranted variation can be investigated and reduced. This work involved designing clinically relevant measures and being at the forefront of linking established datasets to report maternal and neonatal outcomes. Her studies were carried out as part of the GBP4,000,000 National Maternity and Perinatal Audit \(NMPA\), funded by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership and the first comparative analysis of maternity care across England, Scotland and Wales, for which Harris is Senior Clinical Lead. Novel clinical measures were derived from the use of explicit criteria \(validity, fairness, sufficient statistical power, adequate technical specification\) and balanced to cover various dimensions of care. These methodological approaches were peer reviewed through consultation with clinical researchers and the Royal Colleges; they underpinned the publication of peer\-reviewed clinical evaluations and technical studies, and a cohort study of 276,766 women across 87 NHS Trusts to determine the risk of complicated birth, published in *The BMJ* \[R1\]. 

 In August 2017 the first evaluation of how the NHS delivers maternity care was published \[R2\]. New measures were designed to evaluate variations in the availability, configuration and staffing of services; Harris led on identifying and defining the measures. Significant variation was found in the types of maternity units available to women, with only a fifth of Trusts/​Boards offering the full range of birth settings and there was a wide variation in numbers of beds per midwife. The results provided a baseline for the reconfiguration of services in the wake of government maternity care reviews in England, Scotland and Wales. A second organisational evaluation \[R3\], in 2019, revealed that data from the first study had been used to improve clinical practice and the organisation of care. 

 The first evaluation of clinical outcomes was published in November 2017, based on 696,738 births between April 2015 and March 2016 \[R4\]. Representing the largest ever study of the state of maternity care in Britain, it presented 16 clinical measures of maternity and perinatal care, with each evaluated for feasibility, quality and statistical power. Rates of measures were adjusted for risk factors, such as age and ethnicity. For the first time the study, led by Harris, identified outliers, i.e. units with clinical outcomes outside of the expected range. Key findings, which led to improvements in data collection, quality assurance processes and improvements in care, included: 

-  Significant unexplained variation in rates for maternity process and outcome measures. 

-  Women were twice as likely to suffer postpartum haemorrhage \(PPH\) and severe tears during childbirth in some hospitals. 

-  Wide variation in proportion of babies receiving skin\-to\-skin contact within their first hour. 

-  Significant issues in measuring outcomes due to poor quality data and data missingness. 

 A number of peer\-reviewed research reports were published in 2019/2020 \(and are available at www.nmpa.org.uk\). One of these publications established the feasibility of linking maternity data with intensive care data for the first time, finding that women with a higher BMI, an older age at birth or of black ethnic origin are more likely to require admission to intensive care \[R5\]. Harris led on identifying and defining the clinically relevant measures, which linkage of the datasets made possible. These findings were used to influence the development of new definitions to improve data gathering. The second clinical report, based on 728,620 births from April 2016 to March 2017, was published in September 2019 and included three new neonatal clinical measures and one composite measure: Birth Without Intervention \[R6\]. Harris led on defining clinical measures and identifying the clinical implications of the findings. Media coverage raised awareness of the impact of obesity on maternal outcomes. 

 Further research led by Harris involved the analysis of specific elements of maternity care to further inform care improvements and health policy changes. Harris sought to improve the classification of risk of complicated birth. This study, published in *The BMJ* and shared widely on social media \(reaching an upper bound of 821,000 people on Twitter according to Altmetric\), found that parity and obstetric history are the key determinants of the risk of a complicated birth at term. It demonstrated a need for services to give greater weight to parity in determining risk \[R1\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The collection and analysis of high\-quality linked data, led by Harris at DMU \[C1\], made it possible, for the first time, to compare the care that maternity units provide to women in Britain. The evaluation, the largest of its kind, identified priorities for improvement in care, where unexplained variation in outcomes for women and babies exist, identified areas of good practice and detected gaps in policy and guidelines. Harris led on a strategy to engage the midwifery community in the findings and drive quality improvement with published articles in *Midwives*, the RCM’s magazine \(48,000 members\), and *Midwifery Matters*, and presenting at conferences. Evaluation findings are freely accessible to healthcare professionals, policymakers and members of the public via the NMPA website \(www.nmpa.org.uk\). For the first time, units in England, Scotland and Wales are comparing their risk\-adjusted findings with those of others and against the national mean to take action accordingly. 

 **\(1\) BETTER CARE OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN AND BABIES** 

 The research identified a significant percentage of NHS Trusts/​Boards as potential outliers for one of three measures \(>3 SD above the mean\): PPH \(18%\), Apgar score \(13%\), third\- or fourth\-degree perineal tear \(14%\) \[R4\]. A quarter of all Trusts/​Boards \(38 out of 155\) said they had reviewed their local data following the 2017 clinical evaluation \[R4\] and conducted case note reviews and internal audits \[C2\]. Fourteen services carried out staff training and 21 undertook formal investigations into cases or systems, demonstrating the powerful impact that the research has had on quality assurance processes to drive improvements in care \[C2\]. 

 Fifty\-one services volunteered as case studies to present the work they had done in response to the findings in R4 and the effect this has had on clinical measures. There is clear evidence from testimonials that changes in practice as a result of the research have improved care for women and babies. Northampton General Hospital reports that, following implementation of an action plan, the percentage of women experiencing a PPH of 1500ml or more was reduced by more than one\-sixth, or 0.7 percentage points, from 4.1% to 3.4% by September 2018 \[C3\]. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust implemented the Stockport Perineal Care bundle and reported a reduction in the incidence of severe perineal tears \[C4\]. Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust reported a significant improvement in PPH rates following their response to the clinical evaluation findings, which included improvements in calculating blood loss accurately, documentation and multidisciplinary training \[C4\]. 

 Data collected as part of the second organisational survey \[R3, C5\] found that NMPA data had been used to make improvements in the organisation of care within Trusts/​Boards \(59% of respondents\) in collaboration with Local Maternity Systems/​networks \(32%\). Services also used the data to inform women about their services \(15% of respondents\), to guide local audit \(50%\) and to make improvements to data \(44%\) \[C5\]. 

 **\(2\) IMPROVED MATERNITY DATA CAPTURE AND QUALITY** 

 Many services contacted Harris and other members of the research team to request additional support on how to improve the quality of their data, as a direct response to concerns around missing data that were identified through the research \[R4\]. This led to alterations in data fields in local Maternity Information Systems as well as the flow of data through the local system before reaching national initiatives like the NMPA. Data capture improved from 92% in the 2017 clinical report to 97% for the 2019 Clinical Report with a similar improvement in data capture of individual items \[R4: 11, R6: xi\]. 

 **\(3\) INCREASING AWARENESS OF UNEXPLAINED GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION IN MATERNITY CARE OUTCOMES AND EMPOWERING INTEREST GROUPS TO PUSH FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS** 

 NMPA advisory groups include third\-sector groups and members of the public; advice and support are provided by the Women and Families Involvement Group. The NMPA findings have been published in user\-friendly reports on its website, which are designed to inform women’s choices over where and how to have their baby. The website has seen 10,100 new users and more than 99,000 unique page views\[C6\]. The average time spent on the site is five minutes, with an average of six pages viewed, indicating high levels of engagement with the data. Users are predominantly based in Great Britain \(78%\) but there is significant interest from the USA \(6%\), China \(5%\) and other countries \(11%\), illustrating the data is relevant to the international maternity community. This is supported by the research literature; for example, Souter et al \(2020,  [https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000663696.09421.af](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000663696.09421.af)\) have benchmarked outcome measures in a US birth cohort against those published by the NMPA. The website has seen significant spikes in visitors coinciding with the publication of key reports \(and accompanying media coverage \[C5\]\), with 200% increases in weekly traffic \[C6\]. 

 Both the 2017 and 2019 clinical reports received significant media coverage in the UK \[C5\]. Upon publication of the 2017 findings, the BBC reported on calls from the RCOG to investigate unexplained variation, quoting its president as saying: ‘We urge all maternity units to examine their own results and those of their neighbours both to identify role models and to drive quality improvement locally’ \[C5,p4\]. A *Guardian* article \[C5,p2\] highlighted a finding that fewer than one in six women who give birth every year sees the same person throughout her pregnancy and aftercare, despite promises that this should happen. It quoted a senior policy adviser at parenting charity NCT as saying that the research ‘reveals a number of problems including staffing shortages that puts safe care at risk, and postnatal care that often leaves mothers struggling alone’. 

 The clinical findings published in 2019 \[R6\] reported that the proportion of pregnant women overweight or obese had risen to more than half for the first time \(50.4%\), and increasing risk of miscarriage and stillbirths, was covered widely \[C5\]. *The* *Daily Telegraph* quoted the director of the National Obesity Forum as saying the figures were ‘hugely depressing’ and calling on the UK Government to do more to ensure the risks of a high BMI were taught to girls in schools \[C5,p5\]. The 2019 Clinical Report was widely reported across local news media to highlight regions in which there were concerns around care outcomes. For example, *Wigan Today* reported that women who give birth in Wigan were more likely than average to suffer serious blood loss; it also gave the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust the opportunity to clarify that the Trust had bettered the national average for 10 of the 13 NMPA clinical outcome measures \[C5,p5\]. 

 **\(4\) INTEGRATION OF CLINICAL MEASURES INTO DATA STRATEGIES AND CHANGES TO MATERNITY REGULATORY AND POLICY PROCESSES** 

 Harris and the project team have worked closely with national dataset teams, regulators, clinicians and service providers to share learning related to data collection and quality. NHS England has acknowledged that the study programme acts as ‘an important benchmark for local areas, helping identify where improvements can be made, including ensuring the right staffing levels for the women and babies they care for’ \[C5\]. Crucially, three of the 16 clinical measures in R4 \(PPH of 1500ml or more, low Apgar score and third/fourth\-degree perineal tear rates\) were adopted as quality improvement metrics by NHS Digital’s Maternity Dashboard, a dataset that helps maternity teams improve their clinical outcomes, and which was set up in 2016 in response to NHS England’s ‘Better Births’ five\-year vision \[C7\]. Study findings have also influenced the development of new metrics for Version 2 of NHS Digital’s Maternity Services Dataset \(MSDS\), a patient\-level dataset that captures information about activity carried out by maternity services in England \[C8\]. Another HQIP\-funded programme is the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK. A November 2019 report from this enquiry endorsed the following NMPA recommendation, which was published in \[R5\]: ‘data gathering on maternal critical illness should be re\-examined and strengthened by new definitions in order to capture lessons about good care and near miss events’ \[C9\]. The research team shared its ‘outlier’ findings with the Care Quality Commission \(CQC\). As a result, CQC uses NMPA metrics in its regulatory process \[C10\]. This ensures maternity services are held accountable for their findings and called to respond as appropriate, with action or justification for results that are unexpected.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 *Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru* \( *GPC*\) is a historical dictionary similar to the *Oxford English Dictionary*, and is the acknowledged authority on the spelling, derivation and meaning of Welsh words. Apart from its multifarious scholarly uses, it is influential in many areas of the Welsh public sphere, providing the lexical infrastructure of the language necessary to produce terminology for bilingual documentation in fields such as government, education, health, law, and business. Since being made freely available online in 2014, and as mobile apps in 2016, *GPC*’s impact has increased dramatically leading to the Dictionary’s funding by the Welsh Government from 2016 as an essential part of its *Cymraeg 2050* strategy to increase the number of Welsh speakers to one million by 2050. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The project began a century ago. A small team of staff was established at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth by the University of Wales in 1921 and with the help of volunteer readers some 1.75 million citation slips were amassed during the 27\-year reading programme. The first part of the Dictionary was published in 1950 and the completed work was launched by the First Minister of Wales, Rhodri Morgan, at the National Assembly for Wales in 2002. Subsequently the *A–B* section was revised comprehensively to the latest standards of scholarship, more than doubling its length. The first edition contains a total of 7.3 million words of running text in 3,949 pages, forming four substantial volumes arranged under 84,000 headwords. 

 Underpinning research on new and updated entries has been undertaken continuously by the research team at the Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies, and the parts of the Dictionary published since 1 January 2000 account for 30% of the entire text including the entries *streic*<sup>3</sup> to *Zwinglïaidd*, the second edition of *A–B*, and all the additions to *GPC Online*, amounting to 26,690 articles containing a total of 3,169,112 words of text, each article varying in length from a few dozen words to 3,888 words \( *blodau*\). The Dictionary is a team effort, benefiting from the skills, knowledge, and experience of the seven \(latterly six\) editorial staff, an IT specialist, external readers, and consultants. It is a historical dictionary in the mould of the great *Oxford English Dictionary* and like that work is entirely evidence\-based. The editors’ research task is to assemble as much evidence as practicable, analyse that evidence thoroughly, and present an intelligible synopsis of the findings, supported by a representative selection of citation evidence. 

 The essential foundation of the work is the citation collection \(now numbering about 2.5 million paper slips\), but this has been augmented by a far more extensive corpus of electronic texts of all periods \(currently numbering 9,576 items containing 71.34GB of data\) and a 169\-million\-word Web corpus, which is supplemented by advanced online searching of the Web and specific Web resources \(as detailed in Part 4\). Each article is a distillation of extensive research into the word’s orthography, its etymology or morphology, derivative forms \(plurals, singulatives, diminutives, etc.\), variant forms \(including their morphology and etymology where relevant\), collocations, and especially semantics. The definitions are based on a thorough analysis of the available evidence, garnered from *GPC*’s citation collection, an extensive library of electronic texts, online research, library research, and guidance from specialist consultants. 

 The selection of illustrative quotations is particularly important, supporting the semantic analysis presented in the article, showing the use of the word over its recorded history \(potentially over a 1,300\-year period\), and illustrating the various attested forms of the word. Articles may be subdivided into multiple sections based on semantic or syntactical criteria, although the editors strive to make the work as concise as is practicable in order to improve its usability by what is now a far more diverse range of potential users since going online. Hawke’s interest in the theory and practice of historical lexicography has led to a number of invitations to contribute to conferences, journals \(e.g. sect. 3. ref. 6\), and reference works \(e.g. sect. 3. ref. 5\), as well as roles on advisory panels and as a consultant which has influenced the development of other historical dictionaries, such as the new historical dictionary of Scottish Gaelic, *Faclair na Gàidhlig*. Since the online version of *GPC* \(sect. 3, ref. 3\) was launched in 2014, 3,071 new articles have been added to it **\[REF2 26\-AHAF1\]**. Of these 422 were in the printed edition but have been completely re\-edited. Many of the new entries are either for neologisms or compound words of which many were treated originally as cross\-references in order to save space. 

 *GPC* has long been accepted as the authoritative work on the Welsh lexicon. It is highly influential in the academic sphere, as shown by the 1,100 references to it on Google Scholar, 321 of them from the period 2014–2020, and the 272 papers citing *GPC* on academia.edu. It is considered the standard reference for the Welsh lexicon in the scholarly world and was acknowledged by Universities UK’s 2006 publication *Eureka UK\!*, as one of only a handful of humanities projects out of ‘100 discoveries and developments in UK universities that have changed the world over the last fifty years’. This influence continues undiminished.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Welsh Government language policy: **Cymraeg 2050** 

 *GPC*’s impact is concerned principally with the Welsh language which is spoken by over 562,000 people aged three and over in Wales \(2011 Census\) and by around 112,000 in the rest of the UK \(ONS estimate 2007\). The language has equal legal status to English in Wales, is a compulsory school subject from age 5–16, and Welsh provision is a legal requirement in all public services in Wales. The Welsh Government’s *Cymraeg 2050: A million Welsh speakers* strategy aims to almost double the number of Welsh speakers to a million by 2050. Whilst a long\-term strategy for the period 2017–50, with evolving work programmes, the *Cymraeg 2050* annual report for 2019–20 **\(Source 4\)** reports that the emerging trend is that numbers seem to be increasing gradually based on recent evidence from the Annual Population Survey: Welsh Language. 

 As the only standard historical dictionary of the Welsh language, *GPC* is the definitive record of Welsh vocabulary, orthography, and the gender of nouns, and therefore forms the basis for other dictionaries, thesauri, terminology lists and reference works, as well as being a very widely consulted reference for general use. Welsh Government has invested in *GPC* in recognition of its critical role for the future of Welsh language linguistic infrastructure, and how this is contributing to achieving the aims of government policy: notably *Taking Wales Forward 2016–2021,* the *Well\-being of Future Generations Act \(Wales\) 2015* \(indicators 36: Percentage of people who speak Welsh daily, and 37: Percentage of people who can speak Welsh\), the *Welsh language technology action plan* 2018 \(support terminology, lexicography and corpora resources and other elements of Welsh language infrastructure\) and *Cymraeg 2050*. The latter sets out the Welsh Government’s long\-term approach to achieving the target of a million Welsh speakers by 2050 and identifies three strategic themes to achieve this vision: **1\)** increasing the number of Welsh speakers, **2\)** increasing the use of Welsh, and **3\)** creating favourable conditions through the provision of high\-quality infrastructure and context. While *Cymraeg 2050* recognizes the multiple interventions required in meeting its targets \(most notably through formal education\) *GPC* has made a distinct contribution to the strategy in two interdependent areas: 

-  **Linguistic infrastructure:** ensure the continued development of Welsh language infrastructure \(dictionaries, terminology, the translation profession\) as integral to the delivery of this strategy. 

-  **Digital technology**: ensure that the Welsh language is at the heart of innovation in digital technology to enable the use of Welsh in all digital contexts. 

 **Linguistic infrastructure** 

 Long\-term investment in the linguistic infrastructure has been provided by Welsh Government to fund the digital development and continued evolution of *GPC* so that it is the authoritative national lexicographical resource. As noted above, these infrastructure costs are currently funded at £300k annually through a Welsh Government grant \(£1.35m since 2015\), covering most of the costs of the endeavour so that it generates further positive outcomes for the language \(e.g. increasing visibility and enabling the production of high\-quality resources for learners and fluent speakers\). A ministerial press release \(dated 18 July 2018\) on Eluned Morgan’s \(Minister for Mental Health, Wellbeing and the Welsh Language\) visit to the *GPC* team at CAWCS quotes the Minister as saying, ‘As one of the most important works in the Welsh language, it is very pleasing to see that Welsh Government funding is playing a vital role in its future and therefore the future of the language.’ The 2018–19 and 2019–20 annual reports on the *Cymraeg 2050* strategy likewise confirm funding for the next funding period and note that *GPC* has become a linguistic cornerstone of the Welsh language and contributes to many of the strategic goals, including creating favourable conditions for the language, digital technology and promoting the use of the Welsh language **\(Sources 4, 5\).** Similarly, a written Cabinet Statement by Eluned Morgan on the future of Welsh language linguistic infrastructure \(dated 5 Dec 2018\) reaffirmed the funding, considering the Dictionary to be a ‘vital resource, comparable to the *Oxford English Dictionary*’ **\(Source 6\)**. 

 **Language standardization** 

 *GPC* is the foundation for all contemporary Welsh lexicography, as acknowledged, for instance, by the editor of *Geiriadur Cymraeg Gomer* \[Gomer Welsh Dictionary\] \(Gwasg Gomer, 2016\) which was sponsored by the Welsh Joint Education Committee for use as the standard Welsh–English dictionary in all secondary schools in Wales **\(Source 1\)**. According to StatsWales the total number of secondary schools in Wales in 2019 was 187 with 188,475 pupils. The Welsh medium HE/FE institution Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol encourages its staff and students to use *GPC*, with a page dedicated to it in its online resources library, Y Porth, and the College has commissioned Hawke to produce training videos. 

 The ongoing revision of the *Oxford English Dictionar*y likewise draws on *GPC,* and Hawke’s advice as a language consultant has been sought regularly during the drafting \(or revision\) of the etymologies of 54 *OED* entries since 2014 **\(Source 2\)**. Two members of the current staff, Fychan and Parry Owen, and the former Editor, Bevan, represent *GPC* on the Welsh Language Commissioner’s Place\-name Standardization Panel \(constituting half of the panel\), advising local government and the Welsh Government on the standard spelling of Welsh place\-names, based on *GPC*’s evidence for the elements contained therein and the editors’ interpretation of the standard orthographical guidelines **\(Source 9\)**. \( *GPC* itself does not include place\-names although it does use them as evidence for the existence of certain lexical items.\) 

 **Bilingualism, legislative drafting, and translation services** 

 *GPC* is also one of the primary linguistic resources used in the drafting of legislation in Welsh, which has the same status in law in Wales as English\-language legislation and therefore must be used with great semantic precision. The Welsh Government Translation Service’s Legislative Style Guide which ‘offers advice and guidance on the legislative translators' house style to those who translate legislative materials on behalf of the Welsh Government’ makes frequent reference to *GPC* in regard to preferred spellings and the gender and plural forms of nouns **\(Source 7\)**. The two teams of translators who work for Senedd Cymru \(the Welsh Parliament\) and the Welsh Government also use *GPC*, as stipulated, for example, in *Yr Arddulliadur*, a ‘Welsh\-language style guide … developed to give advice and guidance to translators of general Welsh Government texts’ which recommends the use of *GPC* for determining the preferred gender and plural form of nouns **\(Source 3\)**. Hawke addressed Welsh Government translators from across Wales at a training session in 2019 and is consulted regularly on lexical matters. The *GPC* staff have in this regard re\-examined some entries where Welsh Government practice is at variance with *GPC*, and a number of entries have been revised in the light of more recent evidence \(e.g. gender changes to *tudalen*, *proses*, *fersiwn*\). Professional commercial translators, who are mostly either freelance translators or work for small companies, also make extensive use of *GPC* in their daily work **\(Source 8\)**. 

 **Digital technology and public language use** 

 The *Cymraeg 2050* strategy recognizes that while education is central to the vision for the growth of Welsh language use, it is vital that ‘young people come out of the education system ready and proud to use the language in all contexts’, and that ‘digital technologies will be central to the vision within education, helping workplaces become bilingual and supporting social use’. *GPC* in this regard pioneered the use of microcomputers in Welsh lexicography in 1983 with much software written in\-house and the entire text had been digitized by 2002. A new computer\-based editing system, iLex, was introduced in 2010 and the text converted to XML in preparation for an online version, which was launched within the current REF cycle, by the First Minister, Carwyn Jones at the Senedd in Cardiff in 2014, receiving extensive media attention \(sect. 3, ref. 4\). Subsequently, in 2015/16, the Welsh Government funded the development of app versions of *GPC*, which are available at no cost on the Apple iOS, Google Android, and Amazon Fire mobile platforms. *GPC* is, to the best of our knowledge, the only full historical dictionary for any language that is available as an app, including as it does the entire nine million word text. The apps allow for full or partial download of all entries for off\-line access, and include 124,500 headwords, 7,150 variant forms, 34,000 collocations, 475,000 illustrative quotations with source references, over 60,000 cross\-references, and are searchable by word or phrase in both Welsh and English. Two language learning games are also included for pedagogical purposes. 

 The use of *GPC* and its non\-academic impact has increased enormously following its availability online since 2014, further establishing its position as a cornerstone of the linguistic infrastructure. The availability of *GPC* on the Web and in app form, freely available to all, has made the research accessible to a vastly greater number of users. The search interface has been designed to facilitate access by searching for all mutated forms of a word, suggesting partial matches, and suggesting similar words if the search term cannot be found, making it more accessible to those less familiar with the language. Pop\-ups explain both grammatical and bibliographic abbreviations to aid rapid understanding of the text. 

 There were fewer than 400 \(mostly institutional\) subscriptions to the final printed parts of the Dictionary \(2013\), whereas over the period June 2014–2020, 14,419,515 entries were consulted online \(excluding much additional use on mobile devices which cannot be measured if users have downloaded the data to their devices\). The number of entries consulted has risen dramatically: **2014:** 216,418; **2015:** 2,088,367; **2016:** 1,812,421; **2017:** 2,226,353; **2018:** 2,402,887; **2019:** 2,436,526; with a significant increase in **2020** to 3,236,543 **\(Source 10\)**. 

 Mobile usage has increased even more rapidly, from 303,239 uses in the launch year \(Feb. 2016\) to 1,263,384 in 2020. The iOS app has been downloaded 12,123 times since 2016, and the Android app is currently installed on 2,984 active devices in 51 countries **\(Source 11\)**. Although mobile usage has increased steadily as a percentage of total use, PC usage still accounts for over 79% of all transactions, reflecting heavy use in education and by professional translators. Google Analytics data \(2016–present\) show 78,324 unique users from 130 countries visiting the Welsh\-language website and 130,996 unique users from 175 countries visiting the English\-language website, indicating worldwide interest in the project as does the fact that *GPC*’s ‘Word of the Day’ is followed by 4,605 people on Twitter and 2,310 on Facebook. 

 Hawke was one of two UK members of the EU\-funded COST Action ENeL \(European Network of e\-Lexicography, 2013–17\) which led to the establishment of the European Dictionary Portal. *GPC* staff were responsible for the Welsh\-language interface of the portal and for providing access to the major Welsh online dictionaries. CAWCS/ *GPC*  is also an observer and data provider on the Horizon 2020 ELEXIS \(European Lexicographic Infrastructure\) Project \(2018–\), which is pioneering the development of digital lexicography globally.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Referrals to NHS gender clinics increased by 240% between 2013 and 2019, vastly increasing waiting times, during which the risk of self\-harm and suicide is known to increase. Cornwall’s research has shown that improvements to training on variant sex and gender and faith, for faith leaders and gender medicine specialists alike, have the potential to improve trans people’s wellbeing. Her work on ameliorative spiritual care for people undergoing transition, and on LGBTQI\+\-inclusive theologies, has achieved the following impacts: 

 <ins>Impacts on Public Policy and Services in Healthcare</ins> 

 Changes to healthcare policy by NHS Employers, and professional standards of care for World Professional Association for Transgender Health; influenced church policy on same\-sex marriage and gender transition blessings **;** ‘agenda\-setting’ contribution to Church of England Teaching Document on Human Sexuality, *Living in Love and Faith.* 

 <ins>Impacts on Practitioners in Healthcare</ins> 

 Contributed to the Royal College of Physicians’ professional qualifications in gender medicine, the first of their kind worldwide; and changed professional attitudes of teachers, clergy, counsellors and sexual health practitioners. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Cornwall’s work shows how theological categories relate to normative scripts of sex, gender and sexuality in Christian tradition, and that these are neither the most ethically productive nor the most generative of ideals available across the tradition. She has identified and constructed inclusive alternatives also rooted in Christian tradition. Her book based on her thesis, *Sex and Uncertainty in the Body of Christ* \(2010\) *,* is recognised as the leading and foundational text in intersex theology and established her scholarly reputation. Cornwall’s research from 2013 onwards, underpinning the impacts claimed here, focused on: 

1.  Variant sex and gender, religion and faith. This includes journal articles on the centrality of intersex people’s self\-narration \(3.1\) and the theological disruption of hierarchies of good/healthy embodiment \(3.2\), as well as a book chapter \(3.3\) querying the theological assumption that humans may legitimately be sexed only as male or female. 

1.  Sexualities, sex education and the churches \(3.4\) **.** The key finding was that trainee clergy given no opportunity to reflect critically on their own sexuality and gender are less likely to be able to minister effectively across their careers to people struggling with these identities. 

1.  Inclusive theology of sexuality. This included an extended theological contribution to the popular book *Sexuality: The Inclusive Church Resource* \(Darton, Longman and Todd, 2014\). 

1.  Theologies of non\-biological generativity. This led to a monograph \(3.5\) whose key finding was that the diversity of Christian theological traditions on binary sex, gender and biological reproduction have been occluded in church statements of the last 50 years. 

1.  Spiritual care for those undergoing gender transition. In 2016, the Sir Halley Stewart Trust awarded Cornwall £55,506 for the Modelling Transgender Spiritual Care: Pilot Framework for People Undergoing Gender Transition in NHS England Gender Clinics project \(2017\-19\). Among the key findings were that spiritual care has the capacity to impact positively on trans people’s wellbeing before and during medical intervention; that significantly greater healthcare chaplaincy provision needs to be commissioned; and that improvements to training on variant sex and gender and faith for both faith leaders and gender medicine specialists have the potential to increase trans people’s wellbeing. Outputs include a paper calling for improved spiritual care and financial commitment to specialist chaplaincy alongside care by core healthcare teams \(3.6\), and Cornwall’s forthcoming monograph on constructive theology and gender variance.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 Cornwall’s work on theology, sex, gender and sexuality has had a transformative impact on the policies of religious groups and healthcare organisations internationally. Her insights and recommendations have been implemented in new professional standards and training among those working directly with intersex and trans people. Her work on intersex characteristics and trans theology led to a partnership with an NHS gender clinic in the Modelling Trans Spiritual Care project; training professional and campaigning groups on intersex and trans equalities; her membership of a working party for the Church of England’s teaching document on human sexuality, *Living in Love and Faith* \(5.6\); membership of NHS England/NHS Employers’ project on capturing the lived experience of LGBT people and the impact of faith, chaplaincy services, health and marginalisation \(2018\-19\) \(5.8\); and consultancy for the World Professional Association of Transgender Health’s Ethics Committee and Global Education Initiative \(5.2\). 

 <ins>IMPACTS ON PUBLIC POLICY AND SERVICES</ins> 

 Cornwall’s work on Christian constructive theology, variant sex and gender has stimulated and informed policy debate and led to changed policy direction in religion and healthcare. It has foregrounded inclusive theological accounts of variant sex and gender \(notably intersex characteristics and trans identity\). Her research has informed policy direction across contexts and with professionals including clergy and chaplains, healthcare professionals, counselling and gender medicine specialists. 

-  Changing church doctrine, policy and practice in UK and internationally: new liturgy and policy recommendations on same\-sex marriage, and blessing for trans people **.** Cornwall’s work is cited by the Methodist Church Marriage and Relationships Task Group 2019 in its call for the Methodist Conference to enable same\-sex couples to marry in Methodist churches \(5.7\). It is also cited in a Dutch pastoral handbook on transgender, faith and the church. Co\-editor Prof Heleen Zorgdrager says: “As a direct fruit of the handbook and the positive press coverage it received, the Protestant Church in The Netherlands \(PKN\) realized that there was a need for new text materials in its books of order.” \(5.7\) In 2019, official authorised texts of blessing and prayer for trans people were published in the PKN’s book of order \( *Dienstboek II,* “Services of Blessing”, 61b\). 

-  Improving social welfare, equality and social inclusion within the Church of England; contributing to wider public understanding of human rights conceptions. Based on her work in Christian theology and sexuality, Cornwall was one of five invited academic members of the Theology Thematic Working Group for the Church of England bishops’ Episcopal Teaching Document on Human Sexuality, *Living in Love and Faith* \(2017\-20\), with particular focus on intersex and trans concerns \(5.6\). Cornwall is the key scholar cited on intersex. Rt Revd Christopher Cocksworth, lead bishop for the project, noted the “agenda\-setting” nature of Cornwall’s work on intersex \(5.6\). Most Revd Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, notes that the materials “will help the Church to live out its calling … as together we explore matters of identity, sexuality and marriage.” \(5.6\) The Church of England will make decisions and undertake synodical processes in light of the materials in 2022. 

-  Changing health policy and professional standards of care: Devon Partnership NHS Trust; World Professional Association for Transgender Health. Cornwall partnered with the West of England NHS Specialist Gender Identity Clinic \(GIC\) on the Modelling Transgender Spiritual Care project \(5.1\). Cornwall devised a new framework for spiritual care provision for its patients. The Deputy Director of Nursing, Devon Partnership NHS Trust has recommended to the Trust’s chief operating officer that three new chaplaincy posts be created \(5.4, testimonial\). Cornwall was consultant \(2020\-\) to the WPATH Ethics Committee and Global Education Initiatives, advising on changes to its ethics guidelines and framework \(5.2\). Cornwall’s 2019 paper on trans spiritual care is being cited in the forthcoming WPATH \(World Professional Association for Transgender Health\) Standards of Care version 8, due for publication in 2021 \(5.2, emails from SoC Ethics and Education chapters lead author Prof Gail Knudson\). WPATH’s standards of care shape the practice of gender medicine professionals worldwide. 

-  Informing changes to healthcare policy direction: NHS England. Cornwall contributed to NHS Employers for NHS England’s project Capturing the Lived Experience of LGBT People and the Impact of Faith, Chaplaincy Services, Health and Marginalisation, 2018\-19, informing policy direction on trans spiritual care with NHS England leaders along with professionals from the police, fire and prisons service. This led to the development of new policy and practice with regard to healthcare services \(5.8\) including recommendations to: review the 2015 NHS Chaplaincy guidelines to include reference to LGBT people of faith; develop strategic partnerships with key stakeholders who represent LGBT people of faith in order to address health inequalities; contribute to work of the new NHS LGBT advisory team on health inequalities, health and wellbeing, safeguarding, and intersection between faith and sexual orientation; and develop resources to help organisations promote inclusive environments welcoming LGBT people of faith. Jagtar Singh OBE, Chair of Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust and convener of the 2019 national project symposium at which Cornwall delivered training on trans spiritual care, reported that delegates “have committed to applying their learning in their workplace … and most importantly they tell us that the learning will benefit the people they serve” \(5.8\). 

 <ins>IMPACTS ON PRACTITIONERS</ins> 

-  Changing professional practice: new highlighting of spiritual care in gender clinics. Cornwall provided ethics training for nurses, psychotherapists, psychologists and speech therapists caring for trans people at the West of England NHS Specialist Gender Identity Clinic in 2015 \(5.1\). The same year, she gave training on the spiritual needs of trans people to gender medicine specialists at the scientific meetings of the British Association of Gender Identity Specialists \(BAGIS\), doing so again in 2018. In 2019, she gave a keynote speech to 600 people at the European Professional Association for Transgender Health \(EPATH\), including professionals from multiple countries and subdisciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, urology, surgery, gynaecology, endocrinology and occupational health \(5.2\). An EPATH attendee subsequently set up an initiative to include spiritual care in the forthcoming revisions to the gender identity protocol in NHS Lothian and the National Gender Identity Clinical Network for Scotland \(5.2\). 

-  Contributing to new Continuous Professional Development and training provision at the Royal College of Physicians. Cornwall contributed to the curriculum development of, and devised content for, the Royal College of Physicians’ new PGCert and PGDip qualifications in Gender Identity Healthcare in 2019\-20, leading to improved professional development training for gender medicine specialists with a specific acknowledgement of religion and spiritual care. Prof Della Freeth, Executive Director of Education, Royal College of Physicians, records “appreciation of \[Cornwall’s\] contributions to the work” to “support the professional development of clinicians and thereby expand and improve care for gender diverse people” \(5.3\). The course materials also cite Cornwall’s 2019 paper on trans spiritual care. 

-  Changing professional attitudes through improved training. The reach of Cornwall’s impact in changing professional attitudes and improving training is demonstrated by her expert training for diverse groups including counsellors, clergy, teachers, NHS staff, police, fire and prison service personnel, and ministers in the Estonian government. Specifically, training was provided to: 

        1.  Thirty counsellors at the Anglican Association of Advisors in Pastoral Care and Counselling \(2016\). Training was delivered on transgender issues and theologies of sexuality, benefiting the clients with whom these professionals work. One participant noted: “I work with several clergy clients for whom these issues are live, and also with similar young people … I will now be able to begin to listen to their stories more reflectively and with greater understanding.” \(5.5, questionnaire responses indicating changed attitudes to clients\) 

        1.  Spiritual advisers at the Diocese of Exeter \(2018\) on gender identity and sexuality, contributing to their professional development and benefiting their advisees. 

        1.  Fifty school teachers and senior education leads on theology, gender and sexuality through the Learn, Teach, Lead RE project \(2018\), benefiting both teachers and their students. Ed Pawson, diocesan education officer for the Diocese of Exeter, noted: “This has supported teachers in their work to ensure equality for all individuals, helping them understand how to support vulnerable pupils.” \(5.5, Pawson testimonial\) 

        1.  More than 500 Christian clergy and trainee clergy on intersex, transgender, sexuality and queer theology, including the Diocese of Llandaff \(2019\), Diocese of Peterborough \(2019\), Dioceses of Exeter and Truro \(2016\) and the Metropolitan Community Church Office of Formation and Leadership Development \(2015\). Rev Dr Thomas Bohache, continuing education coordinator for Metropolitan Community Churches, noted that Cornwall had “suggested ways in which we might go forward for greater inclusion in church and society” as clergy working for LGBTI inclusion \(5.5, Bohache testimonial\). 

        1.  More than 100 delegates from NHS, police, fire and prison services at the NHS Employers and Asian Fire Service Association development summit on Promoting Excellence and Inclusive Pastoral, Spiritual and Religious Care for All in Leeds \(2019\). 

        1.  More than 100 delegates at the Estonian Sexual Health Association \(Eesti Seksuaaltervise Liit\), including sexual health practitioners, clergy and government ministers \(2019\).

 The Horne research group is an international leader in the behavioural medicine field, particularly involving the development of reliable methodologies for quantifying patients’ perceptions of illness and treatment and developing interventions to support informed choice and adherence by taking account of patient beliefs. 

 Since joining the School of Pharmacy in 2006, Horne has led the validation, application and development of the Necessity Concerns Framework \(NCF\) \[ **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\]. This body of research is built upon Horne’s original conceptual framework for how people perceive pharmaceutical medicines and how those perceptions influence adherence. The Necessity Concerns Framework delineates the fundamental tenets of how patients judge their personal need for the treatment \(Necessity beliefs\) relative to their concerns about the perceived negative consequences of adherence. Horne’s research showed that these perceptions, although logical from the patient’s perspective, are often based on common misconceptions about the illness and treatment. An illustration of the tenets of the framework is given in Figure 1. The framework has been widely adopted in the behavioural medicine field for a range of conditions including asthma, HIV, cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, renal disease, hypertension, depression, diabetes, cardiac illnesses, cancer, and stroke. In 2013, these studies and others were included in a meta\-analysis which demonstrated the utility of the NCF in explaining non\-adherence in 94 peer\-reviewed papers involving over 25,000 patients spanning 23 long\-term conditions and 18 countries \[ **R4**\]. 

 Since 2006, Horne’s work has particularly focused on more detailed studies of the antecedents of treatment Necessity beliefs and Concerns, the framework’s wider application across a range of diseases and, crucially, the development of interventions to improve adherence, both via policy and guideline development, as well as product development. 



 *Figure 1: Illustration of tenets of NCF: Proportion of the sample allocated to each attitudinal group defined by beliefs about Phosphate Binding Medications \(PBM\)* \[ **R5**\] 

 Horne was also the first to map patient beliefs predicting uptake of and adherence to essential anti\-retroviral therapies \(ART\) for HIV infection \[ **R1**\], conducting the first longitudinal study to identify patient perceptions influencing initial uptake \(or refusal\) and subsequent non\-adherence up to 12 months later. A similar study conducted in the USA \(in collaboration with Horne\) \[ **R6**\] corroborated the findings and reinforced the validity of the NCF as an approach to conceptualising and assessing the key influencing beliefs. This work led to a successful application to NIHR in 2011 to fund the development of an intervention to improve ART adherence and the associated 6\-year programme of research \(GBP2,412,986; RP\-PG\-0109\-10047; PI Horne\). 

 Recently, the work has evolved to embrace the evaluation of digital technologies for enhancing adherence. The group is currently evaluating NCF\-based approaches for other conditions including TB, cancer, hypertension and asthma in research funded by NIHR and HTA and through NIHR North Thames Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Development of National Institute for Clinical Excellence \(NICE\) guidelines on Medicine Adherence** 

 As a direct result of his research, Horne was invited to be an author of NICE Clinical Guideline GC76 “Medicines Adherence: involving patients in decisions about prescribed medicines and supporting adherence”, first published in 2009. These guidelines still remain unchanged following review in 2015 and 2019 \[ **S1**\], with his work cited ten times in the current document. This comprises the most authoritative guide for industry and the health service in the UK on the issue of medicines adherence as well as being accessible to patients and patient representative groups. Professor Henry Smithson \(chair of the NICE Guidelines Development Group\) \[ **R3**\] states that, “Prof Horne’s research on the Necessity Concerns Framework was fundamental in shaping the NICE Guidelines. It is fair to say that this research created a paradigm shift in our approach. It transformed the agenda and scope of the guidelines, placing patients’ beliefs about their illness and treatment at the centre of the consultation”. 

 **Development of guidelines for patients taking anti\-retroviral treatments** 

 The work on adherence to anti\-retroviral therapies \(ART\) \[ **R1**\] led Horne to be invited to author the British HIV Association guidelines for the treatment of HIV\-1\-positive adults with antiretroviral therapy in 2015 \(with 2016 interim update; further updated in 2019\) \[ **S2**\]. The report features a section \(Section 6.1\) specifically on adherence and contains recommendations overtly based on the NICE Clinical Guideline CG76.  Horne’s work is cited seven times throughout the report, including citation against the recommendations for interventions for patient support to improve adherence. The Perceptions and Practicalities Approach referenced in the guideline \[citing **R1**\] was developed by Horne as a framework for incorporating the NCF framework in the design of comprehensive, patient\-centred adherence support. 

 **Asthma Medication Adherence: Development of the AstraZeneca digital medication platform and the Turbu\+ app** 

 Horne’s research has been a major influence on AstraZeneca’s digital medication platform. The Executive Director and Head, Biopharmaceuticals R&D Digital Health, Astra Zeneca, states “A peer review of adherence interventions across industry indicates that <1% of all adherence interventions are successful \(at a cost of \~USD2.4bn P.A\). In the last 4 years using Prof Horne’s behavioural science research as a backbone of our programs we have been successful in >80% of all programs in delivering double digit sustainable increases in adherence both to medication and self\-management \(adherence to guidelines\)” \[ **S3**\]. 

 This impact is exemplified by the contribution that Horne’s work has made to the design of the Turbu\+ adherence support system for inhalation therapies \(co\-designed between Horne’s UCL Business consultancy spinout Spoonful of Sugar and AstraZeneca\). This is an app that is used in conjunction with the turbuhaler platform \(to which a data gathering device is added\) that gathers adherence data and offers adherence support, including reminders. An independent assessment of the Turbu\+ system in conjunction with the budesonide/ formoterol \(Symbicort<sup>®</sup>\) Turbuhaler reported a 71% compliance rate over a 90 day period \[ **S4**\]; to place this in context, a recent study using conventional inhalers for COPD reported a compliance rate between 22.7% and 31.8% \[ **S5**\]. 

 As a specific example of the impact of Horne’s research on asthma medication adherence, the Global Initiative for Asthma \(GINA\) no longer recommends treatment of asthma with short\-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonist \(SABA\) canisters alone for safety reasons, due to high use of such canisters being associated with severe exacerbations and death \[ **S6**\]. This represents a paradigm shift in asthma care necessitating a major change in the behaviour of both patients and health care practitioners. Horne applied the NCF to develop the SABA Reliance Questionnaire \(SRQ\) \[ **S7**\] to assess the key beliefs driving SABA over\-reliance. The SRQ comprises a set of simple questions, assessing patients’ beliefs about their personal necessity for SABA and whether they see SABA use as the best way of managing their asthma. Working with Spoonful of Sugar, the SRQ has been incorporated into the Reliever Reliance Test, a pragmatic tool to help prescribers and patients identify and address overuse of SABA. This has been highlighted on the AstraZeneca website \[ **S8**\] and will be rolled out globally by the company in 2021\-2022. The Biopharmaceuticals R&D Digital Health Head comments that: “Prof Horne’s research on the Necessity Concerns Framework has informed global and regional initiatives across the portfolio of AstraZeneca’s digital health programme particularly in respiratory disease where it has been central to our behaviour change strategies. We are currently expanding our collaboration to include other areas including initiatives to enhance patients’ experience of, and engagement with clinical studies as part of AstraZeneca’s commitment to Clinical Trials of the Future” **\[S3\]**. 

 **Establishment of a spin\-out company** 

 Horne’s spin out company Spoonful of Sugar was established at UCL as a consultancy firm for the pharmaceutical industry and the NHS to help patients and other stakeholders get the best from medicines, and exploit the group’s research. Spoonful of Sugar applies behavioural science to help patients and healthcare professionals to get the best from effective treatments by enhancing adherence and optimising health outcomes. The company won two prestigious ‘new\-comer’ Communique awards in 2015 \[ **S9**\] who stated the company are “delivering through their methodology... bringing some much needed rigor to the discipline of behavioural change” *,* employing 10 staff \(full time equivalent\) and a wide matrix team of consultants, with an annual turnover of approximately GBP1,000,000.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 This case study exemplifies how high\-quality research on transformational change has been realised and sustained long term across discrete business contexts. Research interventions in the manufacturing and service sectors have significantly increased competitiveness by improving productivity, operational efficiency, and lead\-times. The study highlights two holistic interventions tailored to their organisational contexts, including the competitive environment, processes, human resources, and training needs. Hartlepool Steel Mill represents a long\-term collaboration where the development of a Lean capability and an enhanced people management strategy prevented closure in 2017. At Benfield Motors, a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) undertaken between 2014 and 2016 focused on reducing costs and improving customer experience in aftersales. The KTP resulted in reduced customer waiting times, increased turnover, and improved operational efficiency. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Newcastle has a long track record of interdisciplinary operations management research, particularly relating to the implementation of Lean principles. Newcastle research has identified and addressed key issues associated with transformational change based on Lean principles in the manufacturing, service, and health sectors. A holistic, participative approach has been developed that tailors training and process improvement interventions to the competitive and organisational contexts of the organisation. 

 Research by Herron and Braiden \(PUB1\) developed a new diagnostic tool to tailor interventions to the organisational context. This incorporated a Productivity Needs Analysis \(PNA\), which gives an overview of key productivity measures and current manufacturing performance; a Manufacturing Needs Analysis \(MNA\), in which the plant processes and problems are defined and are associated with the appropriate tools and metrics; and a Training Needs Analysis, which identifies staff development requirements. The methodology was derived from a Quality Function Deployment \(QFD\) matrix that used a scoring system to identify priorities. This provided a framework that enabled interventions to be tailored to the local context by only selecting appropriate Lean tools. Subsequent research by Herron and Hicks \(PUB2\) reported how Lean could be transferred from an exemplar company \(Nissan\) to large and medium\-sized companies through change agents. Grant 1 extended the methodology to assist small and medium\-sized companies in the North Sea Region of Europe; it developed a framework based on Institutional Theory that explained how contextual factors shaped the approach to implementation \(PUB3\). This further justified the need for the diagnostic tool developed by Herron and Braiden \(PUB1\) to select Lean approaches according to contextual factors. 

 Subsequently, the research focus was extended to the healthcare \(Grants 2 and 3\) and motor distribution sectors \(Grant 4\). The transformational change approach considered organisations’ visions, people, and process improvement based upon Lean principles. The research in the healthcare sector identified that the NHS had adopted a transformational change model, ‘the three\-legged stool’, that comprised ‘vision’, ‘compact’ \(the psychological contract between staff and organisations\), and ‘method’, based upon the application of Lean tools and techniques \(PUB4\). This approach was later adopted by the academic team in the KTP at Benfield Motors \(Grant 4\). 

 In further research, Hicks et al. \(PUB5\) analysed the automotive supply chain. This research identified that automotive manufacturers have separate national sales companies that manage dealerships through franchise agreements. This decouples dealerships from the automotive assemblers who have expertise in Lean, leaving the continuous improvement of processes as the responsibility of the automotive franchisees. Further research identified that the politics of the workplace are an important aspect of transformational change/Lean interventions, underscoring how Lean interventions harness the exploitable desire for recognition amongst marginalised workers \(PUB6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 This section demonstrates how Newcastle research has been mobilised and adopted in two significant organisations in the North East of England: one of the largest private motor dealerships in the UK and the only remaining steel mill producing bespoke steel pipes. The collaborations with both organisations have substantially increased competitiveness by improving productivity, operational efficiency, and lead\-times. 

 **Hartlepool Steel Mill** 

 The first example emphasises how a transformational change strategy based on Newcastle research, implemented from 2004, enabled Hartlepool Steel Mill to be saved from closure by its purchase by Liberty Steel in 2017. To set the context, Hartlepool Steel Mill, under various ownerships from British Steel to Corus to Tata Steel, had attempted several turnaround strategies based on Lean methodologies, but none had resulted in a sustained period of improved performance. The Managing Director \(MD\) of Hartlepool Steel Mill, then under the ownership of Corus, was an early adopter of the research detailed in PUB1 and PUB2. The MD subsequently enrolled in a part\-time PhD with Hicks and McGovern to develop a deeper understanding of transformational change. He states in a letter dated 14 January 2021: ‘ *This enabled me to implement a holistic transformational change programme that encompassed an enhanced people strategy in combination with a comprehensive, continuous improvement programme based on the PNA/MNA/TNA analysis’* \[IMP1\]. He goes on to say that this combined approach enabled Hartlepool Steel Mill to develop a continuous improvement capability under his leadership. 

 In 2015–16, there was a steep decline in the market for specialised steel pipe caused by a collapse in the oil price from USD120/barrel to USD28/barrel. This precipitated announcements of reductions in UK production capacity from major steel producers. Tata Steel had decided to divest, or if necessary, close the Hartlepool Steel Mill. However, in 2017 Liberty House acquired the Hartlepool Steel Mill. The MD states: ‘ *Liberty House acquired the Hartlepool Steel Mill because they perceived it as a world class asset that could be restored to its former glory. Liberty were inspired by the significant improvement in productivity due to the successful transformational change capability which was embedded in the Company’* \[IMP1\]. The MD notes that this protected the employment of 200 people in Hartlepool, which is the fourth most employment\-deprived local authority in England, according to the  [English Indices of Deprivation 2019](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/835115/IoD2019_Statistical_Release.pdf). The MD comments that ‘ *The improvement capability established and sustained through the transformational change programme made the Company sufficiently resilient to survive and compete in a declining and highly competitive market’* \[IMP1\]. 

 The MD completes his testimonial by stating that ‘ *The Hartlepool Steel Mill is continuing its journey of enhancing its capability in process improvement and transformational change’*, noting that since 2014 productivity has improved by a further 8% \[IMP1\]. 

 Therefore, during the current REF period the Company was saved from closure, thereby protecting employment, and productivity was improved by a further 8%. This demonstrates that the transformational change strategy informed by the collaboration with Newcastle researchers has had the sustained impact that previous strategies failed to achieve. 

 **Benfield Motor Group** 

 The second example details the significant impact of a transformational change intervention in an automotive dealership. In 2014, Benfield Motor Group had 1,500 staff and was one of the largest and best\-known private companies in the motor retailing market, with a chain of 34 franchised dealerships. Strong aftersales performance is a crucial outcome of a successful business model in motor distribution. It provides a stable source of profit and insulates against seasonal and other fluctuations in the car sales market. In line with the sector, the contribution that Benfield enjoyed from this area was falling relative to overall costs. To address this and to increase customer satisfaction, the Company had taken a strategic decision to introduce a programme of transformational change but did not have the expertise in\-house. Previous attempts to introduce change with the support of consultants had failed. As noted in Section 2, the automotive manufacturers’ national sales organisations decouple distributors from automotive manufacturing expertise in Lean \(PUB5\). Therefore, Benfield’s CEO commissioned the Newcastle team to assist with transformational change. An ESRC/Innovate UK\-funded Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) with Benfield \(Grant 4\), launched in January 2014, increased productivity and improved customer service as part of Benfield’s ‘Work Smart’ programme \(detailed in PUB6\). 

 The KTP adopted ‘the three\-legged\-stool’ approach to transformational change \(PUB4\), encompassing, vision, people \(role specifications, job design, reward structures, and training\), and process improvement. The KTP Associate led teams of technicians to design and implement process improvements in the Aftersales Department. Employees were trained in using problem\-solving tools, understanding value streams, and the importance of managing workflow to meet customer requirements. This was based on previous research conducted by Herron and Hicks \(PUB2\), the ERIP project \(Grant 1 and PUB3\), and transformational change in the NHS \(Grants 2 and 3 and PUB 4\). The aftersales work was segmented into a ‘green stream’ for fully predictable work \(such as services for relatively new cars\), an ‘amber stream’ for semi\-predictable work \(such as servicing slightly older cars\), and a ‘red stream’ for unpredictable, reactive work. Improved efficiency enabled the Company to service more cars with their existing resources. 

 The KTP was rated as outstanding \(the highest possible rating\) by Innovate UK \[IMP2\] and is featured as a case study on the ESRC’s website \[IMP3\]. The ‘Company Partner’ element of the Final Report \[IMP4\], which has been independently assessed by Innovate UK, and the case study published on the ESRC website \[IMP3\] both attribute the following impacts directly to the KTP: 

-  Increase in the Company's annual sales turnover of GBP720,000; 

-  Customer waiting time at the dealership for routine services reduced from 2 hours to less than 45 minutes; 

-  Process improvements reduced booking lead\-time from 1–5 days to 1 day; 

-  Where a courtesy car was requested, lead\-time was reduced from 1–15 days to 0–9 days. 

 Benfield’s Strategic Development Director explains in the Final Report \[IMP4\] that the KTP had been initiated due to the former CEO’s view that Lean was the future of aftersales. He comments: ‘ *Over the two\-year project, we have developed a clear vision for the transformation of aftersales, and have developed a plan and training package to achieve this’* \[IMP4\] *.* In assessing the impact on the Company, he makes the following comments regarding staff: ‘ *The method of implementation has allowed many individuals across the organisation to have benefited from acquiring knowledge of process improvement tools and techniques that has informed the KTP’; ‘Staff have been upskilled and have been able to contribute to making improvements. Communication channels between different departments have been substantially improved’*; and ‘ *Staff have been motivated to identify and continually make improvements to their work areas and help colleagues make improvements in other areas of the business. These improvements have resulted in increased productivity and efficiency throughout the aftersales function’* \[IMP4\]. In terms of customers, he comments, *‘Customers have appreciated the fast service offered by the green lane innovation that the KTP has produced’*, and ‘ *Customers have received a quicker, more efficient service’* \[IMP4\]. 

 In his concluding remarks to the Final Report, the Strategic Development Director comments, ‘ *Due to the complexities of implementing transformational change, the KTP was vital in developing the strong foundations for what we see as a long journey. The academic team was able to provide guidance to the project owing to their prior experience of, and engagement with, this type of change initiative’* \[IMP4\]. 

 The significant impacts on both Hartlepool Steel Mill and Benfield Motors are examples of impact arising from Newcastle’s long track record of interdisciplinary operations management research combined with extensive collaborations with organisations.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A collaborative research project led by historians at the Universities of Cambridge, Sheffield and Edinburgh has promoted deeper understanding of the experiences of child sexual abuse \[CSA\] in England and Wales between 1918 and 1990. Project researchers have offered new perspectives to public enquiries, and informed media, civil service and practitioner debates.  The impact of understanding the historical context to CSA in a holistic fashion has allowed the public inquiries to deliver more workable and informed outcomes.  Research has helped policy makers understand the kinds of accountability and levels of safeguarding of children that could realistically have been expected in the past, to improve corporate memory and contemporary safeguarding, and to explain the record of inaction and inattention to disclosures of abuse. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 History & Policy, a knowledge\-exchange project directed by Lucy Delap \(2013\-16\), was invited to brief Kate Lampard QC to assist her investigation into the offending of Jimmy Savile on NHS premises in 2013. Lampard received expert testimony from 8 historians, including Delap, Louise Jackson \(University of Edinburgh\), and Adrian Bingham \(University of Sheffield\). She noted the ‘invaluable insight into the parameters of acceptable behaviour, societal norms and the culture of the NHS’ obtained, which helped her investigation ‘avoid hindsight bias and added significantly to the rigour, thoroughness and fairness of investigation reports.’ Building on their complementary historical expertise, Jackson, Delap and Bingham subsequently collaborated on an investigation into the press reporting, practitioner responses to and criminal justice framework for CSA **.** The project broke new ground in a systematic sampling of a range of newspaper reporting of CSA, spanning local and national newspapers between 1918 and 1990. A database of over 700 individual instances of CSA provided crucial data on the historical changes to the reporting and prosecution of CSA, as well as campaigns to counter it. 

 As part of this project, Delap undertook a study of disclosures of CSA that can be gleaned from personal memoirs and oral histories, assessing the impact and disclosure patterns associated with abuse where it did not lead to formal complaints or criminal justice interventions **\[R1\]**. This research helped build a profile of the circumstances under which abuse is disclosed, by and to whom, and with what consequences. This research informed the seminars with policy makers and practitioners. 

 Better understanding of this landscape allowed the researchers to carry out additional searching of the records of practitioners such as moral welfare and social workers, police, young offender institutions, schools and children’s homes, leading to a policy briefing **\[R1\]** and engagements with wider publics and the media **\[R2 and R3\]**.  In addition, the project developed the first amalgamated criminal justice statistics that trace the treatment of CSA cases in the courts over the period 1918\-1970, which concluded that the scale of offending went unrecognised due to the uncoordinated use of prosecutions organised around gender rather than age. It resulted in a jointly\-authored article **\[R4\]**, which tracked the changing duty of care across the education sector, as well as early efforts to monitor offending through the ‘blacklisting’ framework. The work of Delap, Jackson and Bingham led to the award of the Royal Historical Society’s Public History Prize \(Public Debate and Policy\) in 2018. 

 An overlapping group of researchers \(Jackson, Delap, and from the Institute of Criminology in Cambridge, Dr Caroline Lanskey, Prof Loraine Gelsthorpe and Mr Ben Jarman\) were commissioned in 2017 by the Historical Child Abuse Team \[H\-CAT\] at HM Prisons and Probation Service to undertake a review of safeguarding practices and the institutional culture of the secure estate between 1960 and 2016 **\[R5\]**. By consulting inspection reports, reviewing complaints and accountability procedures and unearthing press and parliamentary debates, the researchers provided a comprehensive review of abuse of children related to the changing operational cultures, resourcing, and institutional checks and balances governing prisons, local authority Secure Children’s Homes, Young Offender Institutions and Secure Training Centres. This research also deployed comparative perspectives by cross referencing the equivalent work done internationally by inquiries and Royal Commissions. This research, H\-CAT subsequently testified, ‘assisted HMPPS to structure its approach to responding to witness statement requests, preparing its witnesses in giving oral evidence and recommend improvements ahead of the public hearing’ of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse \[IICSA\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *Confidential material is in italics.* 

 The beneficiaries of this research have been policy makers in criminal justice, staff of public inquiries and practitioners in policing, social work, education and voluntary action, via professional development training, networking events and commissioned, bespoke seminars. The media and wider public debates on CSA have also been beneficiaries of a significantly enriched historical context as a result of the research. 

 Four major areas of impact: 

1.  **1\) IICSA workshops and published reports** 

 Text removed for publication 

 IICSA has now published a Rapid Evidence Assessment **\[E8\]** with the aim of summarising existing secondary research on CSA. It referenced ‘Bingham and colleagues’ on 15 occasions, and drew attention in particular to findings on the provenance and discursive construction of ideas of CSA \(p. 31\), archaic prosecution strategies \(p. 33\), treatment in the media \(p. 41\) and links to homosexuality reform agendas \(p. 85\). 

1.  **2\) Child abuse in specialist music schools** 

 Delap participated in a policy workshop held at the Institute of Musical Research on Sept 15<sup>th</sup> 2015, to discuss her research findings with representatives of the specialist music schools.  The historical research was complemented by findings in sociology and musicology, presented by colleagues Dr Ian Pace \(City University\) and Dr Anna Bull \(King’s College London\).  Responding to the recent convictions of several conservatoire music educators, workshop participants sought to understand how cultures of impunity might have developed within music education, allowing abuse of children and young people to go unreported and unpunished. The Director of the Institute of Musical Research commented after the 2015 event held with specialist music schools: ‘The workshop touched on some of the most important issues in music education.  The discussion suggested ways in which looking at the history of music institutions, as well as their current best practice, can help us understand and root out abuse.' **\[E4\]** 

 A representative of Trinity College London who attended the September workshop reported back to their executive board. In response, Trinity have now established a link with the NSPCC Child Protection in Sport Unit in order to review their safeguarding policies in light of new considerations arising from workshop discussions. The research was also cited \(p. 74\) in the report of the Universities UK taskforce on sexual violence in universities **\[E9\]**. 

1.  **3\) Prisons and Probation Service Historical Child Abuse Team \(H\-CAT\)** 

 Delap acted as consultant on a contract research project for Her Majesty's Prisons and Probation Service \(HMPPS\) H\-CAT, to undertake a review of the infrastructure of child protection within the juvenile secure estate between 1960 and 2016. The review informed the response made by HM Prisons and Probation Service to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, enhanced HMPPS’s institutional memory, and suggested avenues for improved practice of child safeguarding. The team presented the research at the H\-CAT Single Point of Contact Conference \(25 July 2018\) to an audience of regional HMPPS employees. After the presentation of research findings, the Intelligence & Information Manager \(Historic\) Child Abuse Team, HMPPS commented: ‘The research provided invaluable insight into the estate’s chronology … \[It\] has deepened the HMPPS understanding of the historic configuration of the youth estate.  … the research team were able to provide insight into new themes that may not have been apparent without such a wide\-scoping exploration which drew upon international experience and a wealth of literature. The research was shared with the Youth Custody Service, Directors and key staff to encourage dialogue regarding learning and improvements.’ **\[E6\]** 

1.  **4\) Engagement with policymakers, practitioners and the media** 

 In addition, following widespread dissemination of the project findings, team members received invitations from policy makers and practitioners to help contextualise and understand historic CSA cases. This led to the following presentations to practitioners: 

-  Delap and Bingham, ‘Child Abuse and Developments in Law and Practice’, Independent Police Complaints Commission Development day on Child Abuse and Child Sexual Exploitation \(Feb 2016 **\)** 

-  Delap, L. ‘Hearing the voices of victims and survivors’, St Mary’s Sexual Assault Referral Centre \(April 2016\) 

-  Delap, L. ‘Disclosures of child sexual abuse: historical perspectives’, Sue Lambert Trust and Norwich Child Safeguarding Board \(Nov 2017\). 

-  Jackson, Delap and Bingham, Lessons from history: contextualising historical child sexual abuse and safeguarding, Farrer & Co \[a legal firm specialising in safeguarding\], 25 June 2018 

 After Delap’s presentation in Nov 2017 to the Norfolk Child Safeguarding Board, Sue Lambert, the Trust Director, commented: ‘The people I have spoken to found your presentation extremely interesting, and for many quite illuminating as well, with many lessons for today from what has gone before.  I certainly found it fascinating, and I think it will be useful for me when being asked about what is currently perceived as a ‘surge’ in incidence of sexual abuse in recent years.’ **\[E5\]** 

 Since 2015, **media engagements** relating to the project included: 

-  Delap, BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme on 28<sup>th</sup> February 2015 \(reaching roughly 7 million listeners daily\). 

-  Delap, Channel 5 News on 20<sup>th</sup> May 2015. 

-  Delap, L., Research advice, interview and broadcast appearance on 30\-minute radio programme, ‘Speaking Out’, hosted by Sarah Dunant/When Greeks Flew Kites’, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4, 26 Nov 2017.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Each year, over 25,000 young people with long\-term health conditions undergo transition from childhood to adulthood. These young people require specific continuous care, but transition is not always appropriately or adequately provided. Poor transition increases rates of morbidity, including compromised social participation and employment opportunities. A longitudinal Newcastle study with young people in transition, as well as in\-depth interviews with health and social care commissioners, identified seven key recommendations. These included encouraging appropriate parental involvement and offering young people the chance to make decisions about their care. These findings have underpinned national policy and guidelines, such as the 2018 Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership Audit for Transition and the 2019 NHS Long\-Term Plan, which are widely used in practice.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Background and unmet need</ins> 

 In the UK, over 25,000 young people with long\-term health conditions undergo transition from child\-centred to adult\-centred healthcare each year \(R2\). Although they require specific continuous care, it is sometimes not appropriately or adequately provided by either children’s or adult services during this transition period; and the transfer between services is often poorly managed. Poor transition and transfer compromise further education and employment, and increase long\-term healthcare costs**Footnote:**

 Colver et al. 2020 DOI:  [10.7861/clinmed.2019\-0077](https://dx.doi.org/10.7861%2Fclinmed.2019-0077) 
. 

 <ins>Newcastle research:</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>five\-year NIHR\-funded</ins> <ins>Transition Research Programme</ins> 

 Newcastle research began with a study of 40 young people with long\-term health conditions to determine factors important to them during transition \(R1\). This study was the first in its field to use Q methodology, combining qualitative and quantitative methods to identify the range of viewpoints on an issue. The main findings were that young people had a preferred interaction style and valued being seen as an individual. 

 Subsequently, exploratory work was undertaken with commissioners and providers to identify their perspectives \(R2 and R3\). In R2, the first study to contribute evidence on commissioning for transition, 29 commissioners were interviewed and data were analysed using the framework approach. In R3, semi\-structured in\-depth interviews were carried out with 30 commissioners and providers. The main findings were: 1\) transition should be personalised, coordinated and collaborative; 2\) transition should be realised through building universal services, i.e. available to all of these young people; and 3\) integration of commissioning was key. 

 The next two studies within the Programme were R4 and R5. R4 was a four\-year observational longitudinal cohort study of 374 young people \- the first study at this scale. Recruitment started in 2012 and took place across England and Northern Ireland. Participants had one of three highly representative long\-term conditions: 150 with type 1 diabetes; 118 with autism spectrum disorder and additional mental health problems; and 106 with cerebral palsy. R4 found that three particular features of transition had significant positive associations with better outcomes. These were: “appropriate parent involvement”; “promotion of health self\-efficacy”; and “meeting the adult team before transfer”. However, a mixed\-methods study including qualitative interviews \(R5\) showed that implementation of these features was inconsistent. Together, R4 and R5 showed that the essence of good transitional care is good developmentally appropriate healthcare, but that this is not always consistently provided. 

 Finally, a scoping study \(R6\) found that use of the term “Developmentally Appropriate Healthcare” \(DAH\) in the literature was inconsistent. In a consequent ethnographic study \(R7\), 65 semi\-structured interviews of healthcare professionals and managers explored their definitions and concepts of DAH. The five dimensions identified showed similarities with those found in R4 and R5, including “acknowledgement of young people as a distinct group” and “empowerment of the young person by embedding health education and health promotion.” 

 The findings of these studies were synthesised into seven key recommendations for policy and practice: 

 1. Transitional healthcare should be jointly commissioned by adults’ and children’s health service commissioners \(R2, R3\), rather than just children’s commissioners as at present. 

 2. It is essential to ensure that DAH is delivered across all services as it recognises the changing biopsychosocial developmental needs of young people \(R2, R3, R6, R7\). 

 3. NHS Trusts should adopt a Trust\-wide approach to implement transitional healthcare \(R2, R3, R7\). 

 4. GPs, adult and childhood clinicians must plan transition procedures together \(R2, R3\). 

 5. The preferred interaction style of the young person should be identified and adopted to personalise communication \(R1, R7\). 

 6. Transition services should implement three specific features: 1\) parental involvement, suiting parent and young person; 2\) promotion of a young person’s confidence in managing their health; and 3\) meeting the adult team before transfer \(R5, R7\). 

 7. Services uptake and value for money would be improved by encouraging appropriate parental involvement, staff continuity and offering young people the chance to make decisions about their care \(R4, R5, R7\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact on policy and guidelines</ins> 

 Newcastle research has had a direct impact on several high\-level policy documents. First, findings from R6 directly informed definition of the term “developmentally appropriate care” in the 2016 NICE guideline NG43 \(EV1\). 

 This NICE guidance in turn informed the 2018 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Standards document \(EV2\), providing the reference for the statement on page 32: “Service planners must ensure that services are jointly planned for all young people making a transition from children's to adults’ services and that the necessary supporting infrastructure…is in place”. In addition, a toolkit developed by Newcastle \(see below\) is given as a practice example on page 34. 

 Secondly, the seven key recommendations put forward by Newcastle are directly given in the standards and guidelines for the 2018 Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership Audit for Transition \(EV3, page 3\) under the section “Implication for Transition Services \- Newcastle Transition Research Group”. 

 In 2019, Newcastle researchers were invited by the National Clinical Director for Children, Young People and Transition to Adulthood, NHS England, to submit research evidence to support proposals for improving transition. These proposals directly informed the 2019 NHS 10\-year Long Term Plan \(EV4\) as follows: 

 Page 46: “The NHS plays a crucial role in improving the health of children and young people: from pregnancy, birth and the early weeks of life; through supporting essential physical and cognitive development before starting school; to help in navigating the demanding transition to adulthood.” 

 Page 51: “A new approach to young adult mental health services for people aged 18\-25 will support the transition to adulthood.” 

 Page 52: “Keyworker support will also be extended…including to young people in transition to adult services.” 

 Page 55: “Selectively moving to a ‘0\-25 years’ service will improve children’s experience of care, outcomes and continuity of care... By 2028 we aim to move towards service models for young people that offer person\-centred and age appropriate care for mental and physical health needs, rather than an arbitrary transition to adult services based on age not need.” 

 Page 119: “The NHS, together with partners at national and local level, will commit to improve outcomes for our most vulnerable children…by improving access to targeted support for these children, especially during transition to adult services.” 

 The previous National Clinical Director for this area provided a letter of endorsement \(EV5\) citing R1\-2, R4\-5 and R7. The letter confirms that “this research informed the statements about Transition in the January 2019 NHS 10\-year Long Term Plan.” The new National Clinical Director was briefed at his request by the Newcastle Research Group in June 2020 \(EV6\) to inform the Children and Young People’s Transformation Programme. This resulted in publication of the NHS England National Framework For Transition in December 2020, which was informed both generally and specifically by Newcastle research as follows: 

 Page 11: “There should be co\-production with the child or young person and their families at all stages of the care model... Parents/carers should be involved in a way that suits both the young person and the parent/carer,” directly citing R5. 

 Page 19 cites the Developmentally Appropriate Healthcare model as an exemplar local model of care. 

 <ins>Impact on practice</ins> 

 A toolkit to assist with implementation of Developmentally Appropriate Healthcare was created by the Programme co\-investigators \(including Parr and Colver\) and is downloadable from  [www.northumbria.nhs.uk/dahtoolkit](http://www.northumbria.nhs.uk/dahtoolkit). 

 In June 2020, a survey was distributed around users of the DAH toolkit, including NHS Trusts and commissioners, across England and Northern Ireland. From the 48 responses, the following main findings were seen, broadly showing that the seven key recommendations put forward by Newcastle were being adopted into practice \(EV7\): 

-  57% stated that their Trusts recognised young people as a distinct group regarding healthcare and provision. 

-  60% stated that their Trust had a policy for promoting a young person’s confidence in managing their own health. 

-  75% stated that their Trust had adapted environments in which young people are seen. 

-  76% stated that their Trust had policies and processes in place to support transition. 

-  92% agreed that parents and young people were involved in a manner which aims to suit them both during consultations. 

-  96% agreed that children’s clinicians plan transition processes jointly with adults’ clinicians in their Trust. 

-  100% discussed transition with the young person and provide them with written information. 

 These results indicate that commissioners are starting to provide appropriate transition services for young people with long\-term health conditions. Together with the recognition of the importance of successful transition in the NHS Long\-Term Plan, there is clear evidence that Newcastle research is improving the way in which these young people undergo transition.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Mastrobuoni’s research on reducing criminal activity **,** led to the first independent evaluation of a recent IT innovation “predictive policing”.  This research has been pivotal in the continued use of KeyCrime’s predictive policing software called ‘delia®’ in the city of Milan which has been shown to dramatically reduce crime. Importantly this research enabled KeyCrime to grow from a start\-up to partnering with IBM, PSS and sdg Group delivering innovative software to police forces outside Italy. 

 Mastrobuoni's research on prison conditions that reduce criminal recidivism is the single piece of research that informed changes in the basic standards for prison conditions in Italy. The Commissioner for prison reform in Italy and the Guarantor of the rights of persons deprived of personal liberty in Milan drew on the Essex research to evidence the role that prison conditions play in the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Mastrobuoni’s paper \[R1, initially published as a working paper in 2014\] is the first independent and quasi\-experimental evaluation of a recently popularized IT innovation, called “predictive policing”, which collects and analyses data on past criminal events \(specifically commercial robberies\) to predict future events. Police patrols are given these predictions and are asked to plan their routes accordingly to increase their clearance or arrest rates and reduce crime \[R2\]. The system is shown to dramatically increase clearance rates by 30% and reduce crime by 64% \(due to repeat offending, crime rates are shown to be a highly non\-linear function of clearance rates\). 

 Essex research shows that predictive policing improves clearing crimes committed by criminals of all ability levels. Mastrobuoni and Rivers \[R3\] developed a methodology on how to measure such ability levels. Microdata on bank robberies are used to estimate individual\-level disutilities of imprisonment, which are strictly related to the robbers’ abilities. In particular, the identification rests on the money versus apprehension trade\-off that robbers face inside the bank when deciding whether to leave or collect money for an additional minute. The distribution of the disutility of prison is not degenerate, generating heterogeneity in behaviour. The results show that unobserved heterogeneity in robber ability is important for explaining outcomes in terms of haul and arrest. Furthermore, higher ability robbers are found to be more likely to use firearms and to work with partners. Predictive policing is also pivotal in arresting these more able criminals. 

 Arrests and subsequent incarcerations generate an incapacitation effect that is shown to reduce crime but while in prison it is extremely important to rehabilitate inmates. Essex research evaluates the type of prison conditions that are more likely to reduce criminal recidivism. 

 Mastrobuoni and Terlizzese \[R4\] use quasi\-random variation in the fraction of time served in the Italian “open prison” of Bollate to estimate the effect of rehabilitation efforts on recidivism. The assignment to prison conditions may be endogenous, and the paper restricts the analysis to inmates who, due to overcrowding in nearby prisons, are displaced to a rehabilitating prison \(Bollate\), controlling for observed and unobserved measures of potential selection. Spending one more year at the rehabilitating prison \(and one less year at an ordinary one\) reduces recidivism by between 10 and 15 percentage points \(from a mean recidivism of about 40 percent\). For the group of displaced inmates, which is shown to be negatively selected, the effects of rehabilitation efforts on recidivism are larger. While the research found evidence that over time Bollate inmates become more likely to work outside the prison, more than a single mechanism, seem to underlie these effects.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Validation of predictive policing software** 

 Mastrobuoni’s research on the economics of crime evaluates both reducing criminal activity through predictive policing but also the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. His research on bank robberies to estimate individual\-level disutilities of imprisonment, based on a collaboration with the Italian Banking Association \(Associazione Bancaria Italiana\), \[R3\] led to an ongoing collaboration with an Assistente Capo in the Italian Police who established an innovative start\-up company ‘KeyCrime’, specialising in a predictive policing software called ‘delia®’. 

 The founder of KeyCrime approached Mastrobuoni to research the impact of data analysis on police investigations. The results of the long\-run pilot in Milan alongside the academic evaluation of KeyCrime’s predictive policing software by Mastrobuoni \[R1\] created significant interest in the software \(which was later named delia®\), guided it’s development and enabled the founder to leave the police force in 2017 in order to run the company as a viable business \[S1\]. 

 The evaluation by Professor Mastrobuoni guided the development of this predictive policing software from early on in the company’s inception, which subsequently influenced the efficacy of police investigations in Milan. On the collaboration the Founder and CEO of KeyCrime confirms: '… *Research and the first independent evaluation of any predictive policing software, 'Crime is Terribly Revealing' by Professor Mastrobuoni enabled KeyCrime to validate its results \[R1\]...The software has produced validated results in the area of prevention and repression of crime which can be seen in the data made public by the system's users, the Polizia di Stato in Italy. Other institutions have also supported the use of KeyCrime such as the office of Prosecutors of Milan who, in their annual report cite it as a useful tool to support their investigation’.* \[S1\] 

 The evaluation undertaken by Mastrobuoni \[R1\] also cemented the formal adoption of the software by law enforcement agencies in Italy in 2018 \[S2\]. It is embedded into Italy’s national police force, the Polizia di Stato, in the Province and city of Milan where they have reported a 58% reduction in commercial robberies in the city of Milan and 89% reduction in the province of Milan for bank robberies over the period that the software has been deployed \[S3\]. 

 The Founder and CEO of KeyCrime states: *'The publication of the paper \[R1\]  has, without any doubt, brought additional attention to the company KeyCrime s.r.l \- an innovative start\-up formed at the beginning of 2018 \- as well as credibility due to the scientific and statistical validation detailed in Professor Mastrobuoni's paper. This validation is a fundamental element for us and has helped guide the direction of our investment in R&D to extend the approach that the paper described'*. \[S1\]. 

 KeyCrime now has 20 employees and has received millions of euros of finance from venture capital firms. In 2018 formal partnerships with companies sharing a common vision to help make communities safer were announced with IBM and sdg Group \(one of the most important company in the Multinational Analytics Market\) to propose delia® software to the global market for corporate use and to deliver a delia® based solution at the consumer level. While in 2020, PSS, an important Spanish system interrogator, has partnered with KeyCrime to resell delia® predictive policing software to the Spanish and Latin American markets \[S3a\]. 

 Following the pilot phase after the evaluation of the software by Mastrobuoni \[R1\], a statement by Milan’s Head of the State Police in the Giornale scientifico a cura di O.N.A.P December 2014 confirmed the benefits achieved by the predictive policing software which was subsequently formally adopted 

 “*The uses of KeyCrime, which was experimented in Milan’s Police headquarter, have largely met and overcame our expectations. It has proven itself not only capable of meeting our operative needs, but also of indirectly contributing to let the administration’s cost plummet, in a period in which the resources have to be rationalized and well managed in order to grant high security standards in our cities. Thanks to the use of this system, Milan’s Police headquarters succeeded in significantly reducing bank and commercial\-related robberies, becoming a deterrent; this was also possible thanks to the success in identifying numerous perpetrators of such crimes”.* \[S4\] 

 **Reducing recidivism** 

 Professor Mastrobuoni's research on evaluating the prison conditions that are more likely to aid rehabilitation and reduce criminal recidivism \[R3\] was used by the Commissioner for prison reform in Italy and the Guarantor of the rights of persons deprived of personal liberty in Milan to evidence the role that the condition of prisons plays in the tendency of a convicted criminal to reoffend. This was the only research cited in the House of Representatives by the Commissioner for prison reform in January 2018 in relation to the XVII legislature and recorded by the Bulletin of the Joints and Parliamentary Committees Justice \[S5\]. The Guarantor utilises Mastrobuoni’s research to evidence that prisons with a higher rate of condition, \(such as Bollate\), should be considered as a model for the entire penitentiary system to improve reductions of recidivism and positive reintegration of convicted criminals at the end of their sentence \[S6\]. Subsequent recommendations set out by the prison reform commission and the Guarantor, include a booklet published in 2018, ‘Norms and Normality’ which contains a set of standards for the incarceration of adults in Italy including that the standards of detention should not be just ‘minimum’ \[S7\]. 

 The Guarantor of the rights of persons deprived of personal liberty by the Municipality of Milan’s \(est. 2012\), whose mandate includes the promotion of rights and opportunities of persons deprived of their liberty, cites Mastrobuoni’s research \[R4\] in its 2015 Annual Report \[S8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Steven Fowler’s research has led to the development of ‘The Enemies Project’, a platform that promotes new forms of collaborative poetic practice, and which influences creative cultural production internationally. Since 2015, the project has engaged more than 22,000 participants in live venues and through online access, benefitting local and international creative communities by generating new ways of producing poetry as collaboration. It has widened access to poetry for artists and audiences from a diverse range of backgrounds, in addition to assisting English PEN \(‘Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, Novelists’\) by contributing to its work supporting the human rights of at\-risk writers across the world. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since joining Kingston University in January 2015, Fowler has published multiple collections of contemporary poetry that have been translated into 22 languages. The work exemplifies the curatorial, collaborative, and collective ethos informing the Enemies Project, a model and platform named after Fowler’s 2013 collection of the same name. Bringing poets from different backgrounds together to compose and perform new works, the project engenders an interconnective and dialogical approach that is both formal and social in orientation, aimed at transforming traditional, individual, and isolated modes of producing poetry. Building on research in avant\-garde and modernist poetics, it fosters an open, inclusive, and collective practice designed to invigorate linguistic and formal experimentation. It promotes new and diverse poets, overcoming divisions of cultural boundaries and conventions \(the ‘enemies’ of the title\) to better generate new creative communities. It also involves national and international public events and online formats. Reviewing  [<ins> *Enemies*</ins>](http://www.pennedinthemargins.co.uk/index.php/2013/09/enemies-2), David Clarke observed how the dynamic engagement at the core of the work is neither harmonious nor easy, yet remains ‘open to a dialogue with the reader’ **\[R1\]**.Fowler’s 2015 collection of poetry – *Enthusiasm* \- consists of 81 poems that work as individual pieces yet are interlinked by common subjects, including conflict and violence, economy and population, self, modernity, and the past **\[R2\]**. *The Guide to Being Bear Aware \(2017\)* extends interconnectedness to reflect on the Anthropocene as a shifting relation of humans to language, consciousness and animals, breaking down the hierarchies between poet, environment and reader **\[R3\]**.Fowler’s innovations in practice and performance are captured in *Enemies* \(2013\) and *Nemeses* \(2019\), two ground\-breaking collections documenting some of the Project’s international poetic collaborations with a selection of over 50 co\-written and co\-performed pieces and an essay on collaborative poetic practices **\[R4\]**. The work exemplifies the successful development of the ‘camarade’ mode employed by the Enemies Project, in which writers, often from different cultures and backgrounds, are invited to compose and perform together. Other recent publications extend the Enemies Project’s collaborative ethos to interdisciplinary practice.  *House of Mouse* \(2016\) is a collection of ten poetic collaborations written by Fowler and Prudence Chamberlain and developed in a process of performance, each responding to original illustrations by contemporary artists Lizzy Stewart and Duncan Marchbank **\[R5\]**. Fowler’s work on ‘neuropoetics’ with the Wellcome Trust exemplifies the combination of collaborative research, inventive creative practice, and community involvement that explores relations between poetry, art, and neuroscience in academic contexts. The Salzburg Global Seminar on arts and neurosciences and ‘School of Brain and Mind’, Berlin Humboldt University, enabled artistic collaborations on film, radio and sonic. The work highlighted poetic language as a mode of diverse, malleable, and organic cognition, rather than simply as a vehicle of organic expression. It also led to the collection entitled *I Will Show You the Life of the Mind \(on prescription drugs\)* **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Since 2015, the Enemies Project has engaged, in total, around 22,000 participants, including over 400 performers, and audiences of 3,000 \(live\) and 18,000 \(online\). Fowler’s collaborative project has received commissions from organisations including The Hay Literary Festival and the Wellcome Collection, and has received funding from Arts Council England, The British Council, the UK National Lottery Fund, Jerwood Charitable Foundation, Creative Scotland, Arts Council Ireland, National Council for Culture and Arts, Mexico \(Conaculta\), and Arts Council Wales. Fowler’s role was to curate performances and events that involve multiple poets and artists working across an international field. Joining poetry with technology, Fowler’s exploitation of live streaming has benefited a wide range of participants and audience members who would be unable to attend events in person. His contribution has been to increase and expand the audience for poetry and to involve marginalised creative voices in public performance by reimagining the art form as one that is curated and collaborative. This innovative conceptualisation, and the activities that followed, helped reinvigorate poetic practice through interdisciplinary and transnational exchanges between participants and audience members on a global scale. This has led to important impacts on: \(i\) the development of models of inclusive and communal creative practice, \(ii\) the expansion of socially engaged creative production, and \(ii\) the transformation of poetic composition and performance. 

 **Inclusive and communal creative practice** 

 The Enemies Project has been an influential model of how poetic practice can be open to diverse voices. Supported by the Wellcome Collection, The Enemies Project’s *Respites* programme brought artistic enablement to people with disabilities and from low\-income households in London. Through community outreach, *Respites* worked with benefits claimants, creating spaces of artistic and creative exploration for those without conventional access to such exploratory time and space. The project also collaborated with charities which support the visually and hearing impaired, leading to the publication of new works which would otherwise have remained unpublished **\[S1\]**. 

 For example, in Kingston Upon Thames, The Enemies Project has enriched the cultural climate and benefitted residents through the Museum of Futures, a local community space curated by The Community Brain CIC, giving the community access to the arts **\[S2\]**. An annual photopoetry exhibition and accompanying poetry events organised by Fowler since 2016 has connected professional artists and academics with developing local community artists, each year bringing together more than 30 writers to share practice and build a democratic artistic community. This initiative has brought the arts into the local community in such a way as to ‘normalise’ artistic practice and instil creativity as a feature of everyday experience. It has enriched local creative practice by bringing it into contact with international figures and advanced the reputations of younger poets and performers. Underlining the importance of Fowler’s contribution, the Director of The Community Brain has written that ‘ *Steven’s research and creative practice have had an important impact on our community interest company*’ **\[S3\]**. He continues to note that: 

 *The exhibitions and events Steven has collaborated on at The Museum have consistently been amongst our most well\-attended and highly regarded projects, and have contributed towards our reputation not just as a hosting venue, but crucially as a credible partner for local, regional, national and international creative and community endeavour.* **\[S3\]** 

 **Extending social engagement** 

 In partnership with English PEN \(the UK arm of an international NGO campaigning against threats to freedom of expression across the world\) the project showed its ‘literary activism’ by gathering support for the organisation and drawing attention to the plight of writers threatened with persecution. For example, Fowler devised and curated English PEN’s first Modern Literature festival \(\#penfestuk\) in 2016, an event that has continued annually under his leadership. In a letter to the University, English PEN’s programme manager commented that ‘ *the volume of work produced for and performed at the festivals was, I believe, unprecedented. The depth of engagement has also been very moving*.’ **\[S1, S4\]** 

 These events made audiences aware of the plight of these writers while also enriching culture with new creative works inspired by this body of writings. Embracing diversification and democratisation of poetic practice, The Enemies Project was able to expose these works to a worldwide audience. For instance, Adam Baron’s reading on two Turkish writers **,** Can Dündar and Erdem Gül **,** has been viewed more than 1000 times on Youtube **\[S5\]**. PEN’s Programme Manager reiterated the importance of Fowler’s work, stating that his *‘involvement with English PEN has highlighted the value of creating new work with writers at risk and its ability to bring awareness of and stand in solidarity with them*’ **\[S4\]**. 

 **Transforming poetic practice** 

 The Enemies Project has changed the landscape of contemporary poetic practice on an international scale, establishing a model of international, transdisciplinary collaboration involving non\-Anglophone poets and cross\-cultural creative collaboration. This addresses a significant diversity gap evident in the literary and publishing industries in the UK and internationally. The European Council of Literary Translator’s Associations estimates that only 3% of books published in the UK are in translation. Since 2016, the Enemies Project has engaged in collaborations with artists from Japan, Argentina, Sweden, and Portugal, and in interdisciplinary practice by pairing poets with folk musicians, graphic designers, and digital musicians. 

 A significant indicator of the project’s impact upon project participants is that they have gone onto use Fowler’s collaborative model in their own practice independently of Fowler’s involvement. Christodoulos Makris, for instance, highlights Fowler’s impact on poets in Mexico, Ireland and Norway as well as the influence of his ‘ *innovative compositional modes*’ and ‘ *collaborative and cross\-disciplinary practice*’ on his own work **\[S6\]**. The practice has contributed to Makris’ success in extending The Enemies project, subsequently winning the 2020/21 Literature Project Award from the Arts Council Ireland **\[S7\]**. Since 2016, The Enemies Project has led to 133 events, exhibitions and tours involving 1,240 poets from 16 countries **\[S1\]**. Its involvement with the European Poetry Festival \(an organisation sponsored by a range of national\-cultural institutions enabling live and online events across the near continent\) has seen its collaborative practices successfully adopted in poetry organisations and events across Europe, the Baltic and Scandinavia, including the camarade model **\[S1, S8\]**. 

 The model has been further developed across the world in countries such as Mexico and Argentina, as well as being used in educational and supportive contexts to help young writers enhance their experience of writing and performance and gain access to wider audiences. Fostering non\-traditional forms of artistic performance and presentation, the University Camarade project has, since 2016, paired young writers from nine universities in the UK \(Kingston University, Oxford Brookes, Kent, Essex, York, Royal Holloway, Edge Hill University, York St John, and Glasgow\) and provided opportunities to perform new work in live events and through online forums. The project also hosts live poetry events such as ‘Camaradefest’, where 50 pairs of poets read their work and promoted their publications over one day **\[S1\]**. The collaborative practice has led to the publication of 12 volumes of poetry by different poets **\[S1\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Imperial researchers developed a new statistical framework to model the COVID\-19 pandemic which has been used to inform the decisions of policy makers worldwide, for example, in the UK and the US, affecting the lives of millions. From the early stages of the first wave of the epidemic, the framework allowed quantification of the effectiveness of non\-pharmaceutical interventions, especially lockdowns, contributing to worldwide understanding of the effect of such measures. This helped public health authorities communicate about, and maintain public support for, social distancing measures. After the first wave, the modelling framework was further developed and taken up by health authorities, e.g., in Scotland and New York, to guide ongoing policy decision\-making during subsequent waves.  The framework was also a key component in determining the speed of the spread of a new variant of SARS\-CoV\-2 \(the ‘Kent variant’\) detected in England, supporting the evidential basis which led to the introduction of Tier 4 measures in England in December 2020.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic: SARS\-CoV\-2, the virus that causes COVID\-19, had spread far and wide around the world. After the initial outbreak in China, the epicentre shifted to Europe, where countries were considering drastic strategies to control the epidemic, from banning public events to closing schools to lockdowns. 

 During this first wave of COVID\-19, and due to limited testing and asymptomatic spread, reports of case numbers were not a reliable measure of the spread of SARS\-CoV\-2. This meant that existing approaches to quantifying R<sub>0</sub>, the basic reproduction number, and R\(t\), the time\-varying reproduction number, were inadequate to answer the pressing questions facing public health authorities worldwide: How far had SARS\-CoV\-2 spread? Were control measures effective and, in particular, did they bring R below 1? 

 A group of Imperial academics, with expertise in epidemiology, statistics, and machine learning, led by Drs Flaxman, Mishra, Bhatt, Unwin, and Prof Gandy \(Flaxman and Gandy are in the Department of Mathematics\), started work on a new semi\-mechanistic statistical modelling framework to understand the extent of the spread of SARS\-CoV\-2 infections in real\-time, and to infer the effect of government interventions. The framework developed at Imperial relied on the following innovative approaches: 1\) A novel fully Bayesian statistical model that accurately incorporates the time\-delays between subsequent infections and between infections and observations \(both cases detected and death numbers\). 2\) Leveraging of observations from multiple countries and regions, which previously existing epidemiological models did not do. 3\) Open\-source implementation in a probabilistic programming language \(Stan\) to enable widespread dissemination and reproducibility of the modelling approach. 

 The first results and the first model description were released as a preprint \(“Report 13”\) on 30 March 2020 \(peer reviewed and updated in **\[1\]**\) \- Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy were joint first authors, Bhatt was last author, all with equal contributions. This works showed that lockdowns were beginning to be effective across Europe, in the sense of bringing the reproduction number below 1, at a time when death counts were still rising. It also estimated how many lives had already been saved through the non\-pharmaceutical policy interventions. 

 From these methods and approaches, further research activity spawned at Imperial, including specific studies of the epidemic in Italy **\[2\]**, Brazil **\[3\]**, and the US **\[4\]**, each including key novelties in the statistical models. The Italy report **\[2\]** was a subnational analysis incorporating data on human mobility. Brazil **\[3\]** provided the first subnational analysis of the reproduction number in Brazil, finding that R\(t\)>1 in all states analysed, meaning that the epidemic was not under control in Brazil in May. The US report **\[4\]** correctly warned about the precarious position of many states in the US at a critical period after the first wave. 

 Based on the methodology developed in **\[1\-4\]**, Imperial researchers developed an R package called “epidemia” **\[5\]**. In addition, the team also developed a local area model for the UK **\[6\],** made public on 3 September 2020, which provides projections of COVID\-19 cases per 100,000 individuals at the local\-authority \(LTLA\) level across all 4 nations of the UK. Daily updates to these projections are released on a public website. Estimates of R\(t\) from this model were essential to the rapid analysis of the increased transmissibility of the new B.1.1.7 variant of the virus in December 2020 **\[7\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research of the Imperial team informed public and government understanding of the epidemic worldwide, was used by governments to justify maintaining restrictions, and had direct and extensive impact on policy decisions, particularly in Scotland \(from April 2020\) and New York State \(from May 2020\) and in the imposition of stronger restrictions in England in December 2020. 

 **Public understanding and awareness:** The research attracted strong public attention: At least **484** news stories from **332** outlets \(e.g. BBC, Economist, Times, Financial Times, National Public Radio \(US\), Boston Globe, Washington Post\) reported on **\[1\-7\]**, see **\[A\]**.  The Altmetric score of **\[1\]** is greater than 6300, putting it amongst the top 250 articles of more than 16 million articles tracked on Altmetric **\[A\]**.  The website reporting updates from **\[6\]** had more than 750k visitors from 142 countries up to the end of 2020 **\[A\]**. The news coverage was helping public understanding by picking up several results from the research, e.g.: results from **\[1\]** were used to show how many lives had been saved through the interventions \(Daily Telegraph, **\[A\]**\), that more individuals than previously thought has been infected \(Economist, **\[A\]**\), and to describe the state of the epidemic around the time of the first lockdown and to compare it to other European countries \(The Times, **\[A\]**\) **;** local newspapers used **\[6\]** to inform about the likely development of the epidemic in their local area \(Google News search, **\[A\]**\). 

###  Policy makers and health authorities used \[1,4\] to assess and evidence the effectiveness of interventions: 

 The Scottish government's assessment of lockdown effectiveness highlights our impact within this area. The Chief Statistician of Scotland states that “\[…\] *these methods have been crucial in our assessment that the lockdown in March in Scotland was effective, giving us confidence to sustain it and to be able to communicate our decisions to the general public.*” **\[C\]** 

 Members of the French government \(the Health Minister, the Directeur Général de la Santé, President Macron\) used **\[1\]** to demonstrate that lockdowns were working and to encourage the public to stay at home, using the slogan “one life saved every 8 minutes” **\[D\]**. 

 The State of Michigan cited **\[4\]** in a legal case defending the legal basis of their public health measures, as well as on social media and in a press release, in the face of vehement opposition from a fringe \(and violent\) minority **\[E\]**. 

###  Impact on policy decisions, the general population and saving lives 

 The **Scottish Government** used **\[1,5,6\]** extensively. The Chief Statistician of the Scottish Government writes **\[C\]**: 

 *“Based on the source code released from Report 13, we developed a model for **Scotland** \[…\]. This has been key in our decision making process throughout the epidemic. This model has been run on a weekly basis since the end of April 2020 \[…\] Outputs from our model have also been **central to the Scottish Government’s regular COVID\-19 modelling updates, of key interest to members of the public**. \[…\] This has been a **crucial input into ministerial decisions** on advice for the Scottish population, **including on whether to relax or to impose government restrictions**.*” 

 From 29 October 2020, the Scottish government reports our local area estimates **\[6\]** and has been using them as criteria for areas transitioning between lockdown tiers **\[C\]**; 3 of the 5 criteria used are based on **\[6\]**. 

 Overall, there has been strong impact in Scotland; quoting **\[C\]: 

 *“\[…\] the methods developed by Imperial have been crucial in the Scottish Government’s response to the COVID\-19 pandemic. These methods have formed a crucial part in many of our decisions during the pandemic and thus have **had a profound impact on the entire Scottish population, helping to save many lives**.”* 

 Based on **\[1,4\]**, the Imperial team developed a model for **New York State** \(population \~19 million\), 

 *“whose results were discussed weekly \[…\] in the state’s determination of **when regions should begin easing restriction**s \[…\] the modelling results have subsequently been used to assist in identifying hotspots and inform additional control strategies. The Imperial college team has been an important partner … in informing the state’s COVID response.*” **\[F\]** 

 New York State appointed a team of experts, including Dr Bhatt, “who, before giving a region the green light to move from one phase to the next, would review our data and then advise whether it was safe to continue the reopening of that region of the state” \(Cuomo, **\[F\]**\). 

 A model based on **\[1\]** has been influential in the **State of Tennessee**: “ *We were able to construct our first model in one day, which we would never have been able to do without the work you shared. \[…\] This model **helped solidify** **the value of such measures**, and safer\-at\-home in particular, **for several leaders at a critical point** in local decision making.”* **\[G\]** 

 **Tier 4 restrictions in England:** On 19 December 2020, the UK government imposed stricter restrictions in several areas in England, due to the spread of a novel SARS\-CoV\-2 variant. The Prime Minister said: *“NERVTAG’s early analysis suggests the new variant could increase R by 0.4 or greater. Although there is considerable uncertainty, it may be up to 70% more transmissible than the old variant.”* **\[H\]** \(NERVTAG is the “New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group” advising the UK government.\) 

 The figures in the PM’s statement are the result of analysis by Imperial scientists \(a group including Professors Ferguson, Gandy, Drs Mishra and Volz\), which was presented to NERVTAG on 18 December 2020 **\[H\]** and later published as **\[7\]**. The Imperial analysis was based on genomic data as well as on linking local estimates of the reproduction number **\[6\]** to estimates of the proportion of the new variant present. Based on these results plus two further pieces of evidence from other scientists concerning the amount of virus present in samples of the new variant \(PCR Ct values, viral load from genomic analysis\) NERVTAG reached its conclusion **\[H\].** 

 By 30 December, twenty million more people in England were subject to the toughest level of tier restrictions. Further consequences of these results were travel bans imposed e.g., by France and Germany, to stop the spread of the new variant of SARS\-CoV\-2. 

 **Further Policy Impact:** Policy documents from the African Union, the European Union and the World Bank cited **\[1\]**, see Altmetric, **\[A\]**. Prof Gandy gave evidence in the UK House of Commons based on **\[6\]** regarding the local spread of COVID\-19 in the inquiry on “Lessons learnt from Covid\-19” **\[B\].** Prof Gandy and Dr Bhatt were appointed to the SPI\-M subgroup of SAGE \(Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\) from 30/10/2020, contribution to consensus statements, for example through modelling outputs about the effectiveness of the first UK tier system.

 **1.Summary of the impact** 

 The team has discovered effective prevention and treatment for the serious eye condition *Acanthamoeba* keratitis \(AK\), which affects millions of people globally. In ground\-breaking research, UWS has determined that the anti\-fungal compound voriconazole can be used for AK, demonstrating curing in the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. Our expertise has facilitated a clinical\-academic\-patient network to inform best practice, diagnosis and early treatment of the condition, resulting in a reduction in the number of people with AK in Scotland. Our award\-nominated research has resulted in increased knowledge exchange and awareness of AK across world\-leading healthcare and pharmaceutical networks. Experts from Bausch and Lomb based in the USA, one of the world's largest eye care products, have engaged with the UWS team and cited the research for changing the industry attitudes towards AK. 
","
 **2.Underpinning Research** 

 *Acanthamoeba* keratitis \(AK\) is particularly prevalent amongst contact lens users. Contact lens users are at risk of contracting the devastating condition. Affecting 1,200,000 to 3,000,000 people each year, AK is described by many patients as a life\-altering and devastating condition that can lead to blindness and removal of the affected eye. 

 There are several factors in the challenge in finding new treatments for AK. Firstly, current drug regimens require administration to the eye of the patient as part of a gruelling regime, often toxic to humans and ineffective in ridding the patient of AK, due to the microbe’s adaptability and resistance to drugs. Unfortunately, it is an infection that falls under the radar of big pharma, but our work with healthcare and pharmaceutical networks across the globe is raising its profile. To address this the team characterised existing medicines meant for other conditions, with the view of repurposing them for AK. This is a considerably more attractive commercial approach for the pharmaceutical industry to address a rare disease. 

  

 The research is underpinned by university, charity and industry grants, and due to its importance and success at investigating the understudied pathogen, the University has contributed to 3 additional UWS studentships, and a Carnegie Trust PhD studentship has also been won. 

 We have investigated how *Acanthamoeba* interacts with human immune cells **\[3.1\]** and commenced a programme of research to enable the identification of inhibitors that are non\-toxic to humans, but that target essential pathways to *Acanthamoeba.* Also, it is important that any anti\-acanthamoebic drug, does not cause this pathogen to transform into cysts. Cysts are resistant to current treatments and biocides, thus creating the ultimate challenge to clearing infection from a patient. Thus far, we have characterised three metabolic pathways **\[3.2\-3.5\]** and membrane disruption **\[3.6\].** From these studies, it emerged that *Acanthamoeba* has unique gene structures with evidence of new gene fusions that indicate novel evolutionary processes and that pathways can be therapeutic targets. 

 Specifically, we have built upon our knowledge of *Acanthamoeba* biochemistry to prove that the established commercial anti\-fungal, Voriconazole can kill *Acanthamoeba* **\[3.4\]**. Also, we have characterised other essential amino acid pathways and cell membrane structures present in *Acanthamoeba*, but not humans, for rational drug design **\[3.5,3.6\]**. Importantly, these studies reveal that we can kill *Acanthamoeba* and not allow them to transform into cysts. We have also characterised compounds that kill cysts **\[3.6\].** 

 Leading corneal surgeon from the NHS, Sathish Srinivasan, actively requested to become part of the team in 2018, as he identified its huge potential to lead to effective treatment of *Acanthamoeba* and inform the millions of contact lens users worldwide of the dangers. He became a visiting Professor to UWS in October 2018. 

 This research has also informed interdisciplinary research projects, including understanding the biology of *Neoparamoeba perurans*, the causative agent of amoebic gill disease in salmon aquaculture \(impact case study UOA7\). 

 Our research has been recognised via a nomination for the Queen’s Anniversary Prize, as well as being shortlisted for Research Project of the Year at The Herald’s Higher Education Awards in 2019.

 The impact of UWS AK research is diverse, and it has been achieved through the integration of research with stakeholders and beneficiaries in the areas of clinical practice in the UK, patient advocacy worldwide, eye\-care industry in the USA and professional development in the UK. 

 **Impact on clinical approach** 

 Following a **Medical Contact Lens and Ocular Surface Association** meeting in November 2016, we were approached by an Ophthalmologist from the **Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle**, requesting our support in the diagnosis and subsequent medication of a patient, whose keratitis infection had deteriorated. We received a sample of the cornea, on which we performed cultures – following our culture protocols – developed at UWS. The team advised the use of voriconazole as a treatment for the patient based on research **\[3.4\]**, and in May 2017, the Ophthalmologist advised the team, patient was healing. He wrote: ‘ *I have reviewed the patient this morning and her epithelium is healed. She started Voriconazole a month ago and is now using it q.d.s.*’ This highlights that the team’s research\-based treatment protocol was used effectively, the patient’s epithelium healed and the eyesight was saved **\[5.1\].** 

  

 Our expertise in culture methodology, described in our research publications, allowed UWS to introduce state\-of\-the\-art practice through academic clinical partnership with early diagnostic and treatment protocols for AK \( **NHS Ayrshire and Arran** through the visiting Professor, and **Greater Glasgow and Clyde**\). One challenge in AK diagnosis is that many biopsies are culture\-negative, meaning that *Acanthamoeba* cannot be isolated and cultured easily from corneal scrapes and biopsies. However, our pioneering research has recently led to the team to receive human corneal biopsies from AK patients at **Gartnavel Hospital** in order to characterise the *Acanthamoeba* isolates and test drug efficacy on each isolate. This contributes to an emerging AK isolate biobank in collaboration with the healthcare large corporation **Bausch and Lomb in the USA** and Ophthalmologists from **UK**, **USA**, **Italy**, and **Canada,** and in research partnership with the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine** and the **University of New South Wales**, **Australia**. 

 **Impact on supporting patients to raise awareness and speak about their experiences** 

 The *Acanthamoeba* keratitis **Patient Advocate and Founder & Administrator** **\[5.2\]** states: ‘ *the impact of the research performed at UWS, focused on Acanthamoeba keratitis has enabled many patients \(alias AK Warriors, a group of over 1,500 members from around the world, who have come together through social media\) to further understand what Acanthamoeba is and how, this eye infection, causes infection in the cornea*’. Understanding AK from the patients’ point of view is critical to designing effective research. Through patient groups \(participation in 8<sup>th</sup> AK patient meeting London 5<sup>th</sup> March 2020\), we know that patients have many questions: ‘ *why do medicines not work?*’; ‘ *how did I get AK?*’ ‘ *why was I misdiagnosed?*’. The knowledge acquired through our AK drug development research has provided a critical understanding of why treatments are so incredibly difficult and why they can fail. The team has supported two students in England who have developed an innovative way to **raise awareness of the disease through film**. UWS research has been cited and involved in both films **\[5.3, 5.4\].** We also support and contribute regularly to the AK awareness information network set up to increase awareness of AK and help people understand the infection they are living with **\[5.5, 5.6\].** 

 **Impact on professional practice** 

 Our research has already been widely reported in professional magazines **\[5.7\]** and presented at professional conferences and local societies \(attendees included local optometrists\). This has led to a reduction of cases in the West of Scotland – from 17 in 2014 to 5 in 2020 \(data from Gartnavel Hospital\), linked to a change in referral practice with earlier identification. The consultant Ophthalmologist at Gartnavel Hospital **\[5.8\]** wrote: ‘ *I constantly take referrals from community optometrists and I can confirm there is certainly a heighten awareness of acanthamoeba infection among the community optometrists.  The referrals come from them at very early stages of the disease, which makes a big difference.  My opinion, your work with the optometrist has contributed to the heighten awareness and early referrals and benefited all.*’ 

 **Impact on industry** 

 An invited presentation to the **British Contact Lens Association \(BCLA\)** 2019 workshop ‘ *Acanthamoeba* keratitis, from the lab to the eye’, with a task to present our research and challenges we had identified in the diagnosis and management of AK has led to a globally\-significant industry engagement. **A Senior Research Scientist at Bausch and Lomb**, based in the USA \- one of the world's largest suppliers of eye care products \- quotes **\[5.10\]** that ‘ *this research is changing attitudes towards this infection within industry’ and verbally that ‘we \[the company\] are engaged with research undertaken at UWS, in the context of ensuring that their products are effective against AK*’. This is further evidenced by confidentiality agreement between UWS and Bausch and Lomb, allowing UWS researchers to showcase how compounds of eye\-care products can influence AK diagnosis and treatments. Our pioneering research described in **\[3.6\]** was thus patented **\[5.9\]** with the intent to inform industry of the important requirement of eye\-care solutions, including contact lens solutions, to be able to kill *Acanthamoeba* and importantly, its cyst stage.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 On 4 September 2018, a bas\-relief fragment depicting an Achaemenid guard, illicitly taken from Persepolis in 1936, was returned by the District Attorney of New York \(DANY\) to the Iranian government. This is the primary impact of Allen’s innovative research into the modern removal of architectural fragments from the site of Persepolis, which provided the catalyst and evidence for the legal proceedings. This landmark event, the first repatriation of an antiquity stolen from Persepolis, was hailed with popular acclaim in Iran. Amplified by media coverage of the case and repatriation, Allen’s research has had two ripple impacts: first, new curatorial interest in museums worldwide in scrutinising the provenance of their Achaemenid artefacts; second, an impetus for Iranian cultural heritage management to document both looted and surviving Persepolitan fragments. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Allen’s research, which prompted and enabled repatriation of this antiquity, has developed over the last decade from earlier roots. In 2005, in her book *The Persian Empire: A History* \[1\], Allen had already illustrated, using historic photographs, how the modern market for Iranian antiquities developed alongside archaeological exploration of Persepolis. In publications from 2013 and 2016 \[2,4\], Allen piloted a novel historiographical approach to the study of elements dispersed from the site, which revealed that removals typically left scattered but rich documentary traces in institutional and private archives, many not previously identified or exploited. Her 2013 studies \[2,3\] demonstrated how colonial systems allowed 19th\-century visitors to transport masonry home from Iran, while her 2016 paper \[4\] – a chapter in a book about Arthur Upham Pope – exposed the active role the influential scholar played in the dispersal of artefacts looted from Persepolis in the 1930s to western museums. Reviewing this volume, David Roxburgh highlighted Allen’s paper as one laying the groundwork for helping us identify “persistent legacies in the formation and construction of a field” \( *Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies*, 81 \[2018\], 364\). One striking proof of the specific value of Allen’s new approach was her 2013 identification of a Persian fragment in the Victoria and Albert Museum as Persepolitan \[3\]. 

 These discoveries spurred Allen to pioneer a global survey of individual pieces dispersed from Persepolis, and she has pursued painstaking archival research from Rome to Mumbai to track down evidence for removals. These research expeditions have been supported by, among others, King’s College London, the Soudavar Memorial Foundation and the Iran Heritage Foundation. So far, she has identified 160 items held by 50 public collections. One research finding – surprising to some museums, and of key significance for the issue of repatriation – is that over half of these pieces were removed in the 20th century rather than in the 19th. Indeed, many were taken shortly before the November 1930 law that restricted the export of antiquities from Iran, and a few even after the start of the official excavations at Persepolis in 1931. When completed and published together, these researches will provide a foundational study of an important site’s modern history. Meanwhile, Allen has previewed some of her discoveries on her blog <ins>https://persepolitan.org</ins> and in draft catalogue entries made available to the institutions that hold these objects. 

 The most spectacular result of Allen’s new methodology and collaborative groundwork comes from her investigations, between 2014 and 2017, of an ex\-museum fragment, billed as ‘Relief of a Persian Guard from Persepolis’, which re\-emerged on the art market in 2016. Allen recognised that the excavation records at the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago showed the fragment, and a neighbouring piece now in Toronto, still *in situ* in early 1936 \[Figure 1\]; she cross\-referenced this with the excavators’ letters of March 1936 reporting the theft of the sculptures to the Iranian authorities. Since the removal occurred after the introduction of Iran’s internationally recognised cultural patrimony law \(November 1930\), her research provided proof that the Persian Guard was stolen property. For now, details of her findings are available only in the confidential report she provided for the DANY \[5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of Allen’s research consists primarily of a precedent\-setting repatriation, and two secondary impacts affecting curatorial practice worldwide and heritage practices in Iran. 

#  Primary impact: The return of the wandering guard 

 The guard’s history provides essential context to the impact of Allen’s research. This fragment of a guardsman, showing his head and one hand, and a neighbouring fragment, currently in Toronto, belong to one of the bas\-relief ranks of soldiers and subjects which defined the approaches to and staircases of the palaces of the Persian kings at Persepolis. Widely revered as a significant monument throughout Iranian history \(known as Chilminar or Takht\-e Jamshid\), the major excavations by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago in the 1930s recast Persepolis as the quintessential site of the Achaemenid empire \(c550–330 BCE\). 

 The guard, taken from Persepolis in 1936, disappeared from view for 15 years. He re\-emerged for sale \(along with his neighbour\) in New York in 1950 and was acquired for the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts by its then Director. When the relief was stolen in September 2011, the museum claimed on its insurance; on the guard’s recovery in 2014, the museum declined to return the money and instead ‘deaccessioned’ the object. Two British dealers, who did not investigate the object’s full history before buying, acquired the guard. They marketed him in Europe for some months, then in autumn 2017 advertised him, with a guide price of USD1.2 million, at the European Fine Art Fair in Manhattan. 

 On 14 October 2017, Allen supplied a confidential report, via the legal specialist Leila Aminedolleh, to the Assistant District Attorney of New York, Matthew Bogdanos \[A.1 pp.50–1, paras 146–7\]. This presented the research in which Allen proved that the fragment of the palace guard \(and his colleague in Toronto\) had been looted in 1936 \[5\] \[H p.370\]. This report alerted Bogdanos to the illicit status of the relief and prompted him to take action; DANY researchers worked with Allen in investigating the case. Archaeologists based at the Parsa\-Pasargad Research Foundation confirmed Allen’s findings on site, and Iran’s Deputy Minister of Cultural Heritage provided an affidavit of Iran’s ownership of the piece \[A.1 p.51 para.148,A.3,A.4\]. Allen’s evidence and the affidavit enabled the DANY to obtain a seizure order, allowing it to take custody of the fragment on 27 October \[A.1 p.52\]. The DANY filed an expanded court motion on 24 May 2018, drawing on documentation identified by Allen and provided by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago \[A.1\]. On 23 July 2018, a judge ruled that the guard should be returned to Iran; and on 4 September, the DANY handed him over to Iran’s representative at the United Nations, who arranged his return to Iran \[B.1 to B.3\].

 \[@hrouhani Instagram account, 28 September 2018\] 

 The primary impact was therefore the first ever return of an object looted from Persepolis to its home, and the resonance of this precedent both within and outside Iran. The guard accompanied President Rouhani back from the 73rd United Nations General Assembly \[Figure 2\], was displayed at his press conference in Tehran on 28 September 2018 and generated national excitement. On 7 October, a sole\-object exhibition of the guard, using the images taken from Allen’s research proving its theft, opened to great fanfare at the National Museum of Iran, and was visited over 22 days by 11,333 people. An exhibition of creative ‘reproductions’ of the relief by schoolchildren followed \[D.1 to D.4\]. In subsequent months, the guard was also displayed in Mashhad, Bandar Abbas and at the Milad Tower in Tehran \[D.5\], and became the ‘brand’ image for the 1398 Nowruz \(2019 New Year\) celebrations at Persepolis \[D.6\]. 

 It is too early to assess the impact of this case on the market, but it represents a major turnaround since the failure of a 2005–2007 legal challenge to the sale of a similar fragment in London \[B.4\]. In the 20 years before 2007, seven Persepolitan fragments had been publicly sold, of which three had no pre\-1931 history; in the following decade, six fragments came to the market, none with a pre\-1931 history \[B.5\]. The 2018 success was due to three factors: first, New York State law has no defence of purchase of stolen items in good faith; second, the Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bogdanos, after his experiences in occupied Iraq, has been proactive in policing the antiquities trade; third, and most decisive, was the incontrovertible evidence – lacking in the 2005–2007 case – for illicit removal of the fragment in 1936, which Allen was able to provide from her pioneering archival research. The legal proceedings have generated international media coverage and debate \[C\]. The independent lobbying group The Antiquities Coalition summarised the key lessons of this case as being: 1\) the use of archival documentation to prove looting; 2\) the scope of due diligence required for the market to work ethically; and 3\) the precedent set for the return of looted fragments to a specific site \[I\]. 

#  Secondary impact 1: International curatorial practice 

 The guard’s case has highlighted the need for all ‘host’ museums to scrutinise the origin of their Persepolitan fragments. The impact of Allen’s global research continues to expand \[2,5\], as she provides collections with the means to reflect on the legal title to the fragments they hold, document the circumstances of their acquisition and improve understanding and public explanation of their relation to the original site \[G.1 to G.3\]. The Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, holder of the adjacent fragment of the repatriated guard, is undertaking an internal consultation about its status; in 2019, the piece was removed from display \[G.4\]. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts in December 2018 introduced provenance information from Allen in their catalogue listings for their three reliefs from Persepolis \[G.5.i\]. Such information supports curators’ efforts to develop new ways of presenting their objects alongside their history. “This is incredible – thank you\! … so helpful as we reconstruct the lives of each of our collection objects” \(Ainsley Cameron, Curator of South Asian Art, Islamic Art and Antiquities at the Cincinnati Art Museum\) is a reaction echoed by the Dayton Art Institute and the Princeton, Worcester and Seattle Art Museums \[G.5.ii–vi\]. 

 Allen’s research stimulates and supports thoroughness and transparency in museum practice, and, in the words of Claire Madge, the museum consultant and blogger, is “a gift to future generations of Persepolis researchers” both within and beyond museums \[G.3\]. Allen’s mapping of fragments against site photographs has enabled museums to recognise connections between pieces held in different collections, thereby enriching their presentation and public understanding. Two Persepolitan fragments now in California – at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art \(LACMA\) and the Legion of Honor, San Francisco – were originally neighbours in the palace of Xerxes, a finding on which Renée Dreyfuss, the Curator in Charge of Ancient Art, invited Allen to present a public talk \[G.5.vii\]. One figure in Yale, Allen has shown, originally backed onto two in Dumbarton Oaks, Washington DC \[G.5.viii\]. Susanne Ebbinghaus, the George M.A. Hanfmann Curator of Ancient Art and Head, Division of Asian and Mediterranean Art at Harvard Art Museums, commented on such new links, “those of us with responsibility for Persepolis fragments are enormously grateful not only for your extensive research but for your openness in sharing your findings as you make them. This allows us to fill in critical gaps in our knowledge … and to begin developing creative ways in which to convey this information to our visitors” \[G.5.ix–x\]. 

 At the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Allen was the first to identify Persepolis as the source of the museum’s two Achaemenid fragments, one of which will be displayed for the first time in over a century in the museum’s postponed 2020 Epic Iran exhibition \[3\]; the former Iran Heritage Foundation Curator at the museum, Moya Carey, said: “Your research … has been of significant impact to my position as curator … without our cooperative research energy, a Persepolis fragment would be lying unidentified in the V&A’s \[sculpture store\]” \[G.5.xi\]. 

#  Secondary impact 2: Site management in Iran 

 The Director of the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organisation \(ICHTO\) announced in February 2019 that the organisation is taking steps to ‘recapture’ two similar relief fragments \[F.1\]. This is a striking policy change, given that since 2007 the ICHTO had not found opportunities to challenge, let alone recover, such pieces. The return of the wandering guard has demonstrated the connection between documenting historic looting and effective site management. A Shiraz University team has since audited and catalogued all previously unregistered architectural fragments in storage at Persepolis to enhance their safeguarding; this activity complements and underpins Allen’s census of fragments outside Iran \[F.2, F.3\]. Allen continues to make her research results available to colleagues in the ICHTO and at Persepolis. 

 Allen’s role in supporting the repatriation and building the knowledge base to support site management was recognised and detailed by the Iranian television station Ofogh TV, which commissioned a multi\-part documentary about cultural heritage and crime, aired from December 2019 to February 2020. The culminating episode was on Persepolis and featured Allen recounting her research into thefts from the site and the consequent return of the wandering guard \[E\]. Commenting on Allen’s research into the 1936 theft, the voiceover says, “We can clearly see that Takht\-e Jamshid failed to be protected, and that artefacts from this important ancient site were repeatedly stolen” \[E05:58\]. The documentary contrasts the 2017–18 repatriation with the failure of a decade earlier: “We can categorically say that \[this case\] has reached a desired result: the bas\-relief guard’s head is currently in the homeland” \[E30:48\]. It also links the need to recover the detailed history Allen is revealing directly to the site’s future: “Takht\-e Jamshid, the archaeological masterpiece of Iran … has thousands of wounds on its body, wounds that have been inflicted on its body by foreign excavators and their colonial contracts, and robbers and smugglers for their own benefits … now, the danger from foreigners does not exist as before, however, the danger of forgetting the extensive looting of the past, and lack of legal redress, is serious” \[E 36:33\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research carried out by Sam Barrett at Cambridge, between 2000 and the present, to reconstruct a lost body of 11<sup>th</sup>\-century songs based on Boethius’s *Consolation of Philosophy*, has achieved significant reach and attracted international attention. Since 2016, it has brought medieval music to new public audiences through performances, workshops, talks, a CD recording, radio broadcasts, videos, and a project website. Barrett’s collaboration with medieval music ensemble Sequentia has led to significant changes in professional as well as amateur creative practice, and established an innovative methodology that is being taken up by other performers to recover further lost repertories. This research, and the resources it has generated, have enriched Secondary and Higher Education teaching, not only in musicology, but medieval studies more broadly, in Ireland, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UK, benefitting educators and their students. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Sam Barrett is Reader in Early Medieval Music at the Faculty of Music, University of Cambridge. His two\-volume study and transcription, *The Melodic Tradition of Boethius’* De consolatione philosophiae *in the Middle Ages*, was published by Bärenreiter in 2013 **\[R1\]**. This publication collected together and analysed surviving notations for a previously overlooked repertory. Specifically, following a systematic study of neumed manuscripts dating from the ninth to the eleventh centuries, Barrett identified principles underlying the melodic tradition, and transcribed mnemonic notations, in order to attempt reconstruction of anonymous 11th\-century song\-settings of Boethius’s *On the Consolation of Philosophy*, one of the most widely\-read texts of the Middle Ages. While this scholarly approach was successful in establishing about 90% of what these songs might have sounded like, the leap from scholarship to modern performance remained substantial. Collaboration with Benjamin Bagby and other members of his internationally\-renowned medieval music ensemble Sequentia, provided the key. 

 Founded in Cologne in 1977, Sequentia, under Bagby’s direction, has made over 30 recordings dedicated to Western European Music from before 1300, establishing a reputation as the world’s leading exponents of this repertoire. From the autumn of 2014 onwards, Barrett worked with Bagby and Sequentia’s musicians, Hanna Marti and Norbert Rodenkirchen, to explore ways in which creative practice might supplement scholarly knowledge **\[R2\]**. This collaboration achieved success through posing new research questions, facilitating the formation and exploration of hypotheses, and providing recourse to memorised practices built up through sustained engagement with early medieval repertoires and instruments. Together, Barrett and Sequentia explored possible reconstructions of the work, drawing on the extensive practical experience of Bagby, gained through decades of experimentation with his own reconstructions of early medieval song repertories now lost \(most notably, his *Beowulf* project\). 

 The decision was made at an early stage to focus on a particular manuscript \(the ‘Cambridge Songs’ leaf\), whose songs were associated with reports of highly\-skilled instrumental performance. Proposals for melodic versions emerged through intensive periods of collaboration between 2014 and 2018. Barrett’s role as a researcher involved explanation \(summarizing recoverable principles and procedures\) and evaluation \(assessing possible reconstructions in relation to surviving evidence\). The collaborative research then identified unforeseen issues relating to performance practice, and new questions concerning the implications of surviving notations led to further checking of sources between periods of consultation. The results of this collaborative approach were the refinement of initial solutions, discovery of new meanings of specific notational features, and greater insight into the rhetorical features of melodic settings as recorded by notators from the ninth to the eleventh centuries. This research process is described in detail in Barrett, ‘Creative Practice and the Limits of Knowledge in Reconstructing Lost Songs from Boethius’ *On the Consolation of Philosophy*’ **\[R2\]**. 

 Barrett’s research collaboration with Sequentia culminated in a selection of the resulting reconstructions being performed at Pembroke College, Cambridge, in April 2016 – the first performance of this body of songs in over 1,000 years – and subsequently released as a CD, *Boethius: Songs of Consolation* **\[R3\]** *.* The content of the book, article and CD underpin a project website \( [https://boethius.mus.cam.ac.uk](https://boethius.mus.cam.ac.uk/)\) launched in 2018 and designed to bring Barrett’s research within practical reach of a wider public \(see **Section 4/E10**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on professional creative practice and concert programming** 

 The project has had a significant impact on the creative practice and reach of professional musicians. As Benjamin Bagby, director of medieval ensemble Sequentia, notes, the process of reconstructing the songs ‘finds its way from the solitary scholar, through a small group of musicians, to a widest imaginable audience. This … brings us into direct contact with listeners who otherwise might never have heard of Boethius or his magnificent songs’. Bagby writes that work on the project ‘has had a profound effect on the way I think about notation and manuscript sources in the interpretation of medieval song, and has changed my professional practice to an enormous degree … and \[the experience\] will certainly become the standard against which all future projects will be measured’ **\[E1, p.1\]**. Similarly, as a result of the project, Sequentia member Hanna Marti intends ‘to establish such collaborations wherever possible, as it can lead to new insights for both parties, to new discoveries in medieval musicology, and to a more profound hearing experience for concert audiences’ **\[E1, p.3\]**. 

 The methodology developed by Barrett is being used to recover and reimagine further ‘lost’ repertories. In October 2020, composer/performer Stef Conner released her CD *Riddle Songs* \(Delphian\), which explores how lost Anglo\-Saxon songs, for which only the text survives, might have sounded. As Conner explains, ‘for models … I looked to Sam Barrett’s analysis of early medieval settings of Latin *metra* from Boethius’s *Consolation of Philosophy*…I adapted this formula to Old English accentual patterns’. The CD was MusicWeb International Recording of the Month \(October 2020\), Presto Classical Editor’s Choice, finalist for Presto Recordings of the Year 2020, and entered the Top 40 Official Folk Albums Chart in December 2020 **\[E2, pp. 4, 8, 9, 12\]**. 

 The reach of Barrett’s research can be shown through its impact on Sequentia’s concert programming: since 2016, the ensemble has performed to over 3,000 people at 19 concerts across Europe and America, with a programme – ‘Monks Singing Pagans’ – that features the reconstructions of the lost songs of Boethius’s *Consolations of Philosophy* **\[E3, pp.2\-17\]**. The cultural significance of the programme is shown through the critical response and prominence that it has received.  According to the Russian magazine *Apraksin Blues*, ‘even for these performers, veteran rescuers of music from oblivion, \[this programme\] stands out as extraordinary’. The Executive Director of the San Francisco Early Music Society described Sequentia’s performance at the Early Music Festival in Berkeley \(June 2018\) as ‘a revelatory, once in a lifetime artistic experience’. Sequentia’s performance of this programme as part of the Music Before 1800 series in New York was selected as one of the top ten performances of 2017 by critics for the *New York Classical Review* **\[E3, pp. 18, 14, 37\]**. 

  

 **Impact on amateur musicians** 

 The significance of the research can be shown by the impact it has had on amateur as well as professional musicians, not least through a workshop \(ten participants and six observers from professional and amateur groups across the East of England\) and open rehearsal \(20 attendees\) held by Barrett and Sequentia \(April 2016, Cambridge\), and a Study Day at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis \(March 2018, Basel, 19 attendees\). Amateur musicians who attended the events suggested that they would change their creative practice as a result: ‘this event will aid in my confidence of performance greatly. I need to practice stepping outside the pulse’, ‘it showed me I should allow myself more freedom’, ‘it was an inspiration to try more idiomatic improvisation’ \(Cambridge **\[E4, pp. 7, 5\]**\); ‘inspired me to be creative in my own projects, using the tools that were described’, and to ‘concentrate on early neume reconstructions much more’ \(Basel **\[E4, p.15\]**\). They also noted how the events changed their perception of the repertoire: ‘This was wonderfully eye\-opening and has greatly changed how I view modal song – not as fixed repertory but as living tradition’; ‘It was transformative – opened up so many possibilities and sound worlds I’d never imagined’ **\[E4, pp.6, 10\]**. 

 In November 2018, a series of four performance practice videos with Sequentia was launched on the project website for amateur musicians to use as a model for their own performances \(viewed 11,904 times\) **\[E5, p.2; E10\]**; one of the videos has prompted an extensive Facebook debate among amateur and professional musicians on the use of lyres in early medieval music **\[E5, pp. 4\-9\]**. In January 2020 Barrett published on the website an open\-access performing edition of the reconstructions in order to provide both amateur and professional musicians, as well as students and teachers, with all they might need to create their own interpretations of the songs. As one student from the Netherlands commented: ‘this document gives a clear and concise overview of certain songs and how they can be performed, and as such has proven to be a valuable resource which I will likely continue to use in my own practice’ **\[E6, p.6\]**. 

 This project has also benefitted medieval re\-enactors, introducing them, through a talk given by Barrett in Lichfield in April 2018, to a new repertoire, and to the methods behind reconstructing this sound world.  All of the 13 attendees confirmed that the talk had made them think differently about early medieval music and its reconstruction, one participant noting that it had ‘pushed back my knowledge of early music by several hundred years’, and another that it would affect the way they performed medieval music, by using ‘dyed strings\!’ **\[E4, pp. 18, 19\]**. 

 **Cultural Impact on general audiences** 

 The reach of the project can be shown by the impact it has had on wider public audiences. The world premiere of the reconstructed ‘Lost Songs of Boethius’ in April 2016 caught the public imagination. It was reported in over 80 international radio, print, and online media outlets across 17 countries, including: mainstream radio news programmes in the UK \(Radio 4 *6pm news*, BBC World Service *Newsday*\), France \( *France classique*\), US \(NPR *Morning Show*\), Canada \(CBC\) and Australia \(ABC Radio Melbourne *Morning Show*\); in mainstream press, including *The Daily Mail, The Daily Telegraph* \(UK\) *, CNET, Smithsonian Magazine*, *CBS News* \(US\) *, LCI, L’Obs* \(France\), *Le Vif* \(Belgium\), *Adevărul* \(Romania\), *El Universal* \(Mexico\), *Zee News* \(India\), *RT espagnol* \(Spain\); and on popular social media platforms such as Reddit and IFL Science \[ **E7, p.3\]**. A film about the project, together with two videos from the premiere, have been viewed 717,422 times **\[E7, pp. 111, 117\-118\]**. This public interest in the project has continued: over 250 children and adults attended a half\-term event at Cambridge University Library in 2019, at which Barrett performed, and spoke about, the Boethian reconstructions **\[E4, pp. 40\-42\]**. 

 Members of the general public have emphasised the ways in which the reconstructions have enhanced their understanding of history. Comments included: ‘I can almost FEEL the 11<sup>th</sup> Century around me while listening’ \(IFL Science\); ‘Thank you so much for bringing back to life the most beautiful period of European history by its charming music’; ‘We are literally listening to history, if that’s not cool I don’t know what is’ \(YouTube\) **\[E7, pp. 121, 116, 113\]**; ‘This performance made medieval music alive in my mind – before it was merely an impression of something long forgotten’ \(post\-concert feedback, 2016\) **\[E4, p.12\]**. 

 The project also changed perceptions about early medieval music: ‘I'm really shocked that it's as complex as it is... Really beautiful’ \(IFL Science\) **\[E7, p.122\]**; ‘It’s closer to jazz than I imagined\!’, ‘I have never thought about early medieval music before, but now I will’ \(post\-concert feedback, 2016\) **\[E4, pp. 8, 10\]**. Members of the general public in addition expressed their new appreciation of the research methodology behind the project: ‘absolute amazement. Did not have any idea how such notation was interpreted’; ‘I was totally unaware of the scholarly dimension of the reconstruction’ \(Open Rehearsal in April 2016\) **\[E4, pp.4, 3\]**. 

 Radio programmes dedicated to the project have included BBC Radio 3’s weekly *Early Music Show* \(25.11.2018, average live audience figures, 92,000; available as a podcast indefinitely\), described by a listener as ‘one of the very best Early Music Show broadcasts’; Catalunya Musica’s *Sons de l’edat mitjana* \(22.09.2018\), described by the producer as ‘one of the great moments’ in the programme’s history; and WFMT Radio’s *Early Music Now* programme \(17.08.2020; broadcast to 43 main stations across the US with a weekly audience of 47,000 unique listeners; also broadcast in the Philippines and Australia\). The project has also been featured on Polskie Radio \(3.02.2019\), as well as on BBC Radio 3’s *In Tune* \(‘Astonishing, spine\-tingling stuff’, June 2018\). These broadcasts have continued to extend the global reach of the project to a more targeted audience of classical music lovers **\[E8\]**. 

 Response to the CD co\-produced with Sequentia **\[R3\]** indicates further public reach and cultural impact. The CD achieved critical and popular acclaim alike. In addition to industry awards and critical acclaim \[see **Section 2 and E9, pp. 2\-14\]**, it entered the UK Specialist Classical Charts at no. 14 \(re\-entering at no.17 five months later following the BBC Radio 3 *Early Music Show*\); earned a 100% five\-star rating across Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, and Amazon.fr; and was one of allmusic.com’s recordings of 2018. Musicwebinternational.com described it as ‘genuinely revelatory in its restoration of what we had lost, and profound in the resonances it adds to one of the greatest European classics’ **\[E9, pp.15\-16, 17, 19, 22\]**. 

 The growing significance of the project can be seen following the launch in 2018 of the website \(which the British Library has asked to archive **\[E10, p.5\]**\). This has increased the reach of the research by improving the accessibility of the new repertoire, and the research methods that led to its reconstruction, for all key beneficiaries: from professional and amateur performers, to interested members of the general public. The website has had 4,911 visitors, and has been viewed from every continent \(as of 31.12.2020\) **\[E10, pp.2\-3\]**. As one such visitor tweeted: ‘for anyone interested in recovering the music of the remote past, this website is a must\-visit\! Exemplary methods and beautiful results\!’ **\[E10, p.4\]**. A series of seven manuscript\-based videos were developed for the website, in which the neumes are illuminated as each song progresses, in order to illustrate the relationship between the notation and the sound. These videos open the research further to a general audience, while offering a model for medieval digital musicology: as one twitter comment noted ‘\[we\] should explore something like this for \#PolonskyGerman\!’ \(a Polonsky Foundation Project to digitise Manuscripts\) **\[E5, p.20\]** The videos, described as ‘genius’ on Twitter, have been viewed 15,790 times since launching in July 2020: viewers have praised the ‘nice animation for those of us who are new to this sort of notation’, and noted that it is ‘Brilliant to hear Boethius' songs revived. An added layer of richness to the manuscript’ **\[E5, pp. 21, 9, 22**\]. 

 The impact of the project’s public engagement activities was recognised by the National Co\-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement, which longlisted the project for an Engage Award for Public Engagement with Research in December 2016 **\[E7, p.125**\]. 

 **Impact on teaching** 

 Testimony from lecturers has shown that the project resources \(the project film, videos, website, and CD\) are being used to enhance Higher Education teaching not only in medieval music but in medieval studies more broadly, in Ireland, the Netherlands, Chile, Germany, the UK and Switzerland. One lecturer at Trinity College Dublin, who uses the resources for an interdisciplinary MPhil course in Medieval Song, wrote: ‘\[The project film\] is an excellent example of dynamic collaboration between research and performance \[…\] encouraging performers to be more research\-aware, and also demonstrating that exchange of knowledge and expertise can be two\-way, something which is sometimes overlooked in pure research on silent sources’. She added that ‘Because the ‘Lost Songs’ project itself is inherently interdisciplinary, it speaks to people from a variety of backgrounds, thus not only students of music’. The interdisciplinary reach of the impact of this project is further demonstrated by a Professor of Philosophy in Chile, who said he would include recordings of the songs in his seminar on *De consolatione* ‘so we may have a richer vision of this complex literary and philosophical work’; a leading German Classical Philologist who planned to ‘treat the \[musical\] setting \[of *Die consolatione*\] in his next Boethius seminar’; and a UK academic who noted ‘I’ve taught *The Consolation of Philosophy* to MA students at the University of Bristol, but knew nothing about this music. I will teach it differently next time’ **\[E6, pp.3, 4, 2**; **E4, p.11\].** 

 The project website has facilitated the integration of historical reconstruction into music curricula. In November 2020, discovery of the website led to a group of music theory students from the Royal Conservatoire of The Hague focussing on one of the Boethian songs as a case study – a departure from their usual focus – and inviting Barrett to give a seminar to eight students, teachers, and professors **\[E6 p.9\]**. Attendees described the impact the seminar and website would have on their teaching, providing them with resources, understanding and confidence: ‘Using the knowledge I have received today I will be able to show my students much more specific parts and examples of medieval music and how to perform it \(or at least how to research it before performing\) than I have been up to now’; ‘I would dare to speak more about medieval music when teaching teenage students elemental music theory in my home country, Greece’ **\[E6, p.6\]**. A Swiss musicologist has also stated that he ‘will integrate the results \[of the project\] into \[his\] lessons’ **\[E4, p.14\]**. 

 The project has in addition had an impact on teaching for schoolchildren. In response to the launch of the manuscript\-based videos, one school music teacher in Monaco wrote that her class would consequently ‘be kicking off the year with medieval music’ **\[E5, p.23\]**. Since January 2019 Barrett has delivered six outreach seminars based on this project to 80 state\-school students in Years 10\-12, in Cambridge, Bristol, and Swansea. These seminars had a significant impact on the students’ understanding of, and engagement with, a subject that was entirely new to them: of the 18 Year\-12 students who attended the Cambridge seminar in October 2019, 89% said that they had been inspired to pursue the topic further **\[E4, pp.21\-39\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Underpinning Research: University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) researchers led an extensive programme of descriptive and intervention studies in early palliative care, providing evidence that suffering and financial problems due to ill\-health are preventable from earlier in the illness journey. This led to the development and evaluation of the clinical Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool \(SPICT\) in community and hospital settings. Using the research\-based SPICT indicators and guidance drives effective identification of needs and planning of palliative care. 

 Significance and Reach of Impact: Scottish legislation now allows earlier access to welfare benefits for people with all advanced illnesses \(from 2016\), and financial support for family caregivers \(from 2018\). Scottish, UK, European, Australian, Canadian and World Health Organization policies and guidance all recommend use of the SPICT. 

 As a result of these policy and legislation changes, more people at the end of life in Scotland, especially those with advanced multi\-morbidity, now receive palliative care planning \(69% in 2017; 60% in 2014 and 38% in 2011\) and do so earlier \(on average 6 months earlier in 2017 than in 2014\).

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  The Challenge: Timely identification of needs and care planning for people with declining health due to a range of conditions 

 People with life\-threatening illnesses are known to suffer unnecessarily when they do not receive holistic palliative care to help them live as well as possible until they die. The key challenge is to identify people with diverse illnesses while there is still time to have a significant impact on their quality of life and service use. This was addressed by UoE’s Primary Palliative Care Research group \(PPCRG\) through development and validation of the SPICT from 2014. 

##  Palliative care needs are universal and usually start many months before dying 

 Early work by the PPCRG had demonstrated the relevance of early integrated palliative care for people with heart and lung disease as well as cancer \( [UoE/UoA1/M](https://impact.ref.ac.uk/casestudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=23858)\). A pivotal 2002 study contrasted dying of heart failure with dying of lung cancer in the UK \[3.1\] and showed that all patients and families had unmet physical, social, psychological and spiritual needs and suffered unnecessarily, but people with heart failure received little coordinated care and fewer health, social and palliative care services. 

 Since 2014, UoE’s longitudinal, multi\-perspective methods, intervention modelling and feasibility trials have built a convincing evidence base of health\-related suffering in people with different illness trajectories: 1\) progressive cancers, 2\) organ failure \(heart, lung and liver\), 3\) frailty and multimorbidity, and 4\) major stroke \[3.2, 3.3\]. The key finding was that palliative care needs are universal and usually start many months before dying \[3.2\]. Feasibility trials in organ failure \(liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart disease \[3.3\]\) provided more evidence that palliative care planning from diagnosis is acceptable to people with all serious illnesses, improves care coordination and reduces hospital admissions of low benefit. 

##  Using research to change patient experiences and outcomes: SPICT 

 Having researched people’s needs, illness trajectories and experiences across diverse advanced conditions, the PPCRG next highlighted the adverse consequences of ‘prognostic paralysis’ \(i.e. delayed discussion of end\-of\-life issues until death is imminent\). Boyd addressed the evident lack of an effective tool and process for timely identification of people for palliative care by developing a new clinical tool \(SPICT\) with educational resources, and by setting up an international network of SPICT Partners \( [www.spict.org.uk](file:///C:/Users/llorenz/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/OBDRIZCL/www.spict.org.uk)\). Identification is based on burden of advanced illness and general markers of declining health indicative of unmet care needs \[3.4\]. Although the concept was introduced in REF2014, the definitive SPICT tool has been produced over the subsequent 6 years \(2013–2019\) based on emerging research findings, expert consensus among SPICT Partners, and evaluation in primary and secondary care in the UK and internationally \[3.4\]. Boyd has supported completion of research\-based translation, adaptation and validation of SPICT into 10 other languages with 7 more underway, and for lower\-income settings \(SPICT\-LIS\) \[e.g. 3.5\]. 

##  Supporting family carers as well as patients 

 In 2016, UoE research with family carers of people with advanced illness modelled and evaluated a systematic approach to identify, assess and support carers of people with palliative care needs in primary care. This mixed\-method, feasibility study in 4 Scottish general practices led to improvement in carers’ welfare and reduced stress and anxiety \[3.6\], for which the research team won the 2019 National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) award for “the most impactful recent palliative care study” in the NIHR portfolio.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Impact on Scottish Government strategy and policy 

 Timely identification of people with any advanced or life\-limiting illness is the first commitment of the Scottish Government Palliative Care Strategy for 2015–2021 \[5.1a, b\], reflecting the UoE PPCRG’s key research finding. This strategy recommends SPICT in primary care settings to identify people for palliative care assessment. The Healthcare Improvement Scotland toolkit for patient identification and anticipatory care highlights the benefits of using SPICT \[5.1c\]. The Scottish Government lead for palliative care confirms that *“research by the PPCRG, and especially the SPICT, has been instrumental in the successful delivery of palliative care earlier, and to many more people in Scotland”* \[5.1d\]. The NHS Scotland National Digital Platform, currently under development, will replace the Key Information Summaries \(KIS\) and include SPICT as a recommended tool to prompt care planning \[5.1e\]. 

##  Impact on Scottish legislation 

 UoE palliative care research has directly informed 2 key bills passed by the Scottish Government. 

 The first provides more financial support for family caregivers \[Carers \(Scotland\) Act 2016; \[5.2a\]. The second legislation means people with any advanced progressive condition receive financial support earlier and regardless of diagnosis \[Social Security \(Scotland\) Act 2018; \[5.2b\]. This Social Security Act was widely reported in mainstream media, for example by the BBC \[5.2c\]. The Head of Policy & Public Affairs for the UK charity Marie Curie, who campaigned actively for this legislative change, citing UoE research, said; *“This research helped us show MSPs* \[Members of the Scottish Parliament\] *in the Scottish Parliament that people with terminal conditions in addition to cancer also need a new fair definition of terminal illness*” \[5.2d\]. All 4 ‘special rules for terminal illness’ in the Act \(no minimum period; no requirement for assessment; eligibility from date of application; entitlement to maximum amount\) stem directly from UoE research \[p.59; 5.2b\]. These changes to national benefits are being applied in clinical practice using the SPICT to guide assessment and eligibility \[5.2e\]. 

##  Impact on clinical practice in the UK 

 Since 2019, Scottish and English General Practitioner \(GP\) contracts have instructed NHS Primary Care Organisations and GP practices to implement community palliative care for people who need it, and highlight SPICT as a key tool to identify more patients \[5.3a, b\]. GPs in Scotland now complete electronic KIS to communicate people’s care plans to NHS 24, GP out\-of\-hours services, hospitals and the ambulance service as part of routine care. 

 Following the widespread practical uptake of the SPICT in Scotland, the number of patients receiving palliative care planning documented in a KIS before they die increased from 38% in 2011 to 60% in 2014 and 69% in 2017. These people also received coordinated care planning much earlier; a median of 10.3 months before dying in 2017 compared with 4.1 months in 2014 \[5.3c\]. Furthermore, within 3 months of the start of the Covid\-19 pandemic, the number of KIS in Scotland rose from 4% of the population to approximately 17%, indicating the extent to which proactive anticipatory care planning is established as essential to good patient care \[5.3d\]. 

 The Royal College of General Practitioners and Marie Curie published the Daffodil Standards in 2018, defining UK\-wide core GP standards for palliative care in advanced, serious illness and end\-of\-life care. This resource combines policy recommendations with educational resources and is being re\-launched in 2020 as part of the COVID\-19 response. Standard 2 “Early Identification” refers to key PPCRG research and recommends SPICT \[5.4a\]. The Royal College of Physicians report “ *Talking about Dying*” seeks to offer advice and support for any doctor on holding conversations with patients much earlier after the diagnosis of a progressive or terminal condition and recommends SPICT for patient identification to prompt timely discussions about palliative care \[5.4b\]. In Scotland, SPICT is being used to identify people who could benefit from the ReSPECT process, which is the Resuscitation Council UK’s care\-planning process built around a summary of Recommendations for Emergency Care and Treatment for when a person lacks capacity to make or express choices \[5.4c\]. 

##  Impact on global policy and practice internationally 

 The SPICT has been translated and revalidated into 10 languages \(French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese\) and at least 7 further translations are in progress to support good practice and train GPs, hospital doctors and other clinicians. 86 SPICT Partners routinely use a version of SPICT in more than 30 countries, and over 4,000 people are on the current SPICT mailing list. SPICT website analytics show that SPICT downloads have been rising steadily since 2014, numbering 128,100 by November 2020. 

 Since 2014, national bodies and healthcare providers in many countries including Canada \[5.5a,b\] and Australia \[5.5c\] have embedded versions of SPICT in their clinical management systems and recommended it as an identification tool to support delivery of systematic, early palliative care and to support care planning in educational resources. 

 UoE research has been instrumental in developing *“a deeper understanding of illness trajectories and how generalist and specialist palliative care complement each other in primary care settings”* as stated by the President of the European Association of Palliative Care \(EAPC\) \[5.6a\]. The information provided via the EAPC Primary Care Toolkit \(including use of SPICT\) means early identification of palliative care needs in primary care is now national policy in many European countries \[5.6b\]. In 2018, 9 out of 34 countries reported financial incentives for early identification \[5.6c\]. The French National Plan for the Development of Palliative and End of Life Care \(2015–2018\) recommends early identification of patients, involvement of primary care professionals and use of SPICT\-FR \[5.7a\]. In Belgium, a Royal Order recommends use of SPICT\-BE to identify palliative patients \[5.7b\]. The Danish Health Authority issued a guide entitled ‘’Recommendations for palliative action’’, which recommends SPICT\-DK for use at the primary level \[5.7c\]. 

 In addition, 3 key World Health Organization documents \(2014, 2017 and 2018\), all citing UoE research and specifically the SPICT, state the need to integrate palliative care for patients with all life\-threatening illnesses in the community as being a core aspect of primary healthcare \[5.8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research on public transport system performance, undertaken by the  [Transport Strategy Centre](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/transport-studies/transport-strategy-centre/academic-research/) \(TSC\) within the  [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/), has led to direct improvements in the design, management and operations of mass transit systems in the world’s largest cities. 

 The TSC pioneered the development and application of an analytical platform for the measurement and evaluation of system performance across multiple domains.  Continuous collaboration was established with over 110 major transport operators serving over 500,000,000 citizens. In addition to the obvious societal impact in improving transport in many countries, the financial impact of our research is estimated to be over GBP1,000,000,000 over the current REF period, including: 

-  CAD500,000,000 in capital cost savings to the Montreal Metro. 

-  GBP350,000,000 per annum increase in passenger revenue in Beijing. 

-  A 33% increase in design capacity for new metro lines in Guangzhou. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 An analytical platform to measure and evaluate the relative performance of mass transit systems has been pioneered jointly by Transport Strategy Centre \(TSC\)  \(formerly called RTSC\) co\-Directors  [Professor Daniel Graham](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.j.graham) and  [Richard Anderson](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/richard.anderson) in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Imperial. It is based on continuous cooperative industrial collaboration, organised in the form of operator consortia, to generate the data and information necessary for fundamental statistical analysis, along with the funding required to support underpinning research and its translation into practice. Throughout the current REF period, TSC has managed 9 consortia comprising over 100 major public transport operators around the world \(modal coverage: urban metros, light railways, mainline railways, buses, airports and infrastructure providers\). Since 2000, Graham, Anderson and their colleagues have developed data collection systems, benchmarking methodologies, analytical approaches, statistical models and processes to facilitate the application and impact of research to industry. The TSC is the sole researcher and facilitator of the consortia and, due to its unique ability to procure data across a global network, no other organisation worldwide undertakes similar research for the mass transport sector. 

 The underpinning research comprises three key strands: 

1.  **Development of an analytical framework to measure and evaluate performance \[R4\]** – Continuous development of robust and rigorous data definitions and systems to evaluate public transport performance, with formalised data capture, validation and collection on an annualised basis across consortia. The data generated via industrial collaboration provide a unique longitudinal source that form the basis of our performance analytics platform. 

1.  **Statistical modelling to identify performance drivers \[R1, R2, R3\]** – Statistical modelling tools have been developed to evaluate public transport performance and uniquely identify the determinants of performance across multiple domains of operation. For example, modelling of service provision \[R1\] quantified the role of operational and exogenous characteristics in efficient resource usage, resulting in an improved understanding of optimal capacity provision. The modelling of incidents causing delays to train service \[R3\] identified key factors influencing reliability, and has been used by operators such as the Shanghai Metro to contribute to a 5\-fold improvement in reliability. Empirical analysis of metro ridership \[R2\] quantified the responsiveness of demand to changes in fare levels, income and quality of service, which has been used to directly influence fares policy in a number of global cities including extensive application in Beijing. 

1.  **Systematic analysis of operator\-specific performance and underlying policies, processes and practices** **\[R5, R6\]** – Empirical evidence on capacity utilisation and passenger responsiveness to crowding \[R5\] has been complemented with further quantitative and qualitative investigative research relating to the design and operation of high\-capacity metro systems \[R6\]. This work has been used to make the case for higher levels of investment and capacity in mass transit systems.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The TSC designed and continuously manages an innovative, formal process to organise engagement with and dissemination to industry, providing a clear path from research to impact. A key innovation has been the establishment of industry consortia, steered by member public transport organisations and facilitated by the TSC. This continuous engagement enables the generation of unique longitudinal data and detailed observations that form the basis of the underpinning analytical research. 

 The nine consortia include the  [Community of Metros](http://cometandnova.org/) \(42 metros from major cities such as Paris and Beijing\), the  [International Bus Benchmarking Group](http://busbenchmarking.org/) \(16 organisations including TfL London Buses, Istanbul IETT\) and the  [American Bus Benchmarking Group](https://americanbusbenchmarking.org/) \(21 operators\). Other consortia encompass operators of mainline railway operators and airports. 

 Impact has arisen from significant improvements to the design of public transport systems, financial efficiency, fare and funding mechanisms, and the measurement and management of service quality. The impact cited, are a selection from 10 of the 110 consortia partners where the sum of per annum and one\-off financial benefits cited exceeds GBP1,000,000,000.  Many policy benefits, once established, generally continue for some years beyond the initial impact.  We would expect further social and economic impact to arise from the improvements to service quality and enhanced design, but these are not easily quantifiable. 

 Five key categories of impact generated in the period August 2013 to July 2020 are as follows.  Each category is supported by evidence provided by one or more transport companies in six countries: UK, China, USA, Canada, Portugal and Turkey, who benefitted directly from our research. 

 **I1.**  **Change in the design and planning of new metro lines in mega\-cities \(underpinning research R1, R5, R6\)** 

 The rapid development of metros in China and India has been directly influenced by TSC research that has strengthened the economic \( **R1, R5**\) and operational \( **R6**\) case for higher\-capacity metro lines, enhancing the benefits that metros bring to mega\-cities: 

 **\[Source 1.1**  [**Guangzhou Metro Company**](http://cs.gzmtr.com/ckfwEnglish/) **, 2017\- ongoing\].** 10 new metro lines or extensions have been designed with larger and longer trains representing an increase in train capacity of 33%.   The evidence states that: 

 *“Ongoing expansion projects, including 10 new lines or extensions totalling 258.1 km between 2017 and 2023, are being directly influenced by the research carried out by the TSC at Imperial College London.”* 

 **I2.** **Directly influencing funding policy \(underpinning research R2\)** 

 Statistical research \( **R2**\) into the responsiveness of public transport demand was combined with evidence from the longitudinal datasets and syntheses of policy and practice.  The impact has been significant changes to fares and funding policies in several cities: 

 \[ **Source 2.1:**  [**Beijing Mass Transit Railway Operation Corp.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Philippe Sands’ research, leading to the multi\-award\-winning *East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity* \(2014\), has blended international legal history, biographies of leading lawyers, and family history, in a way that has: 

1.  generated substantial new cultural artefacts on history, law and justice; 

1.  globally engaged diverse groups in international criminal law and justice, and strengthened the campaign for a new convention on crimes against humanity; 

1.  facilitated active practices of memorialisation and commemoration; and 

1.  injected momentum into public reckoning over responsibility for past atrocities. 

 Audiences of millions around the world have been introduced to a history of international criminal justice they would not otherwise have known, and have been invited to reflect on our legal apparatus for international criminality and our reckoning with the past. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Sands has developed a body of work on crimes against humanity, genocide, and the post\-WWII development of international law and courts, alongside his work as a barrister in connection with crimes of this nature. This research has explored the trajectory, promise and limits of prosecutions for international crimes, both before international tribunals and before national tribunals exercising ‘universal jurisdiction’ \(permitting prosecution even where the prosecuting state has no particular connection to the crimes\). Thus, Sands’ 2003 analysis of International Court of Justice and national jurisprudence on atrocity crimes discussed developing law on the immunity of current and former high officeholders, the competing visions of international law underpinning these cases, and their effects on prospects for prosecution of international crimes before national courts **\(R1\)**. In 2010, in reflection of his prominence in the field, Sands was invited by the law faculty of Ivan Franko National University of Lviv \(now in Ukraine\) to speak about his work on atrocity crimes, and the enduring consequences of the post\-WWII Nuremberg trials for the world. This invitation brought Professor Sands to a city that was the birthplace of his own grandfather, and to a university at which Hersch Lauterpacht and Raphael Lemkin, lawyers who would go on to play major roles in the prosecution of Nazi crimes, had both studied in the early 20th century. 

 The visit to Lviv, and Sands’ encounter with intersecting life stories linked to the city, ignited a project that traced the evolution of concepts that have dominated Sands’ work as an academic and a barrister, as well as Sands’ own family history. His consequent exploration of the roots of international criminal law involved legal research into the Nuremberg proceedings, and archives including the papers of Robert H Jackson \(Chief Prosecutor at Nuremberg\), and the Lauterpacht family papers. The latter yielded Lauterpacht’s drafts of sections of the opening and closing speeches given by the British prosecutor, Sir Hartley Shawcross, at the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal. In an analysis introducing publication of these Lauterpacht drafts for the first time, Sands traced Lauterpacht’s thinking \(some of which had been omitted from the final speeches as given\) on the characterisation of crimes, including the relationship between ‘crimes against peace’ \(i.e. waging aggressive war\), ‘crimes against humanity’, and ‘war crimes’; and individual and state responsibility for these crimes **\(R2\)**. Sands also pursued interviews with survivors from Lviv, relatives of those involved at Nuremberg, and his own family. These encounters sparked and complemented his archival inquiries and allowed Sands to develop a mode of writing which, as in a 2011 lecture, ‘A Memory of Justice’ **\(R3\)**, interwove personal histories with the development of international criminal law. These threads of research and methodological innovation were critical to Sands’ authoring of the best\-selling and award\-winning non\-fiction book *East West Street* **\(R4\)** \( **EWS**\). 

 *EWS* reveals how thinkers like Lemkin and Lauterpacht sought to adapt the apparatus of law to address unprecedented atrocity. *EWS* brings into focus conceptual and practical differences between the legal categories that these men developed: ‘crimes against humanity’ \(which captures large\-scale brutality, often, but not necessarily, directed against identifiable groups\), and ‘genocide’ \(coined as a new crime by Lemkin to capture the—in some views particular—horror of conduct which, while committed against individuals, seeks to eliminate certain human groups\). Sands’ unique narrative style blends the fruits of deep research with the process of research itself, a feature that \(inter alia\) involved discussion of his own interaction with the descendants of the leading Nazis. This novel research output prompts fresh, complex questions about the role of present\-day individuals in confronting the responsibility of their own families and societies for past atrocities.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The unique methodology of Sands’ research makes *EWS* exceptionally gripping, and thus conveys the history and potential of international criminal justice to a global readership \(more than 200,000 copies sold in print; with further e\-book and audiobook sales; translated into 22 different languages\). The book has: 

 **\(i\)** **Generated substantial new cultural artefacts on history, law and justice**, drawing directly on the personal stories from *EWS* **\(R4\)** and their lessons of the Holocaust: 

-  A performance piece, *A Song of Good and Evil*, written by Sands and interweaving the story and prominent figures from *EWS* with photographs and music from their lives \(debuted London Southbank Centre 2014; performed in English, French and German, at more than 24 venues in 11 different countries, viewed by more than 20,000 people\); and 

-  A documentary film, *My Nazi Legacy: What Our Fathers Did*, featuring descendants of Nazis whom Sands met in the course of researching *EWS* \(premiered April 2015, Tribeca Film Festival; screened in cinemas in 6 countries from Apr–Nov 2015—the UK, US, Israel, Canada, Germany and Sweden; broadcast by BBCFour 4 times in 2016; and made available on DVD and Amazon Prime video internationally\); and 

-  A BBC Radio 4 podcast, ‘ *The Ratlin*e’ \(live audience \~900,000; more than 2.2m downloads\) with Sunday Times bestselling book, ‘ *The Ratline: Love, Lies and Justice on the Trail of Nazi’* \(Weidenfeld & Nicolson 2020\), tracing the family history of one of these figures \(55,000 copies sold in UK across print, e\-book and audiobook to 31 December 2020; translation into 3 languages\) **\(S1\)**. 

 *EWS*, together with these new cultural artefacts, and Sands’ extensive research\-informed engagement \(detailed below\), has led to three further kinds of impact: 

 **\(ii\) Globally engaging diverse groups in international criminal law and justice, and strengthening the campaign for a new convention on crimes against humanity** 

 The intense interest in the book \(at least 35 reviews in leading national newspapers, global press, and practitioner publications **\(S2\)**\) reflects its **unique ability to inform diverse publics about the history and promise of international criminal law**. Sands has given hundreds of talks in over 30 countries to groups including: **judges** \(of the High Court, Court of Appeal, UK Supreme Court, European Court of Justice, European Court of Human Rights\); **lawyers  \(Bar Council of England and Wales, Scottish Faculty of Advocates, American Society of International, British Institute of International and Comparative Law\); **Jewish communities** \(American Jewish Historical Society, USC Shoah Foundation, Yad Vashem UK Book Club\); and the **general public** \(e.g. Hay Festival events on *EWS* in 2016, 2017\). The book has sparked **interest and engagement in a range of communities**, from the Civil Service Champion for Faith and Belief blogging about *EWS* \(2019\) and inviting civil servants to participate in Holocaust Memorial Day events **\(S3\)**; to the NGO RightsInfo \(now EachOtherUK\), making a short video drawing from Sands research, *Hersch Lauterpacht: Hero of Human Rights*, for the \#FightHateWithRights campaign, designed to counter racial and religious discrimination and illuminate the importance of law in this struggle \(over 40,000 views on Facebook\) **\(S4\)**. 

 The widespread public interest aroused by *EWS* has **offered a platform for powerful messages about atrocity crimes**. Most obviously, as the Civil Service Champion for Faith and Belief wrote after reading *EWS*: ‘ *Genocide doesn’t just happen, it’s the culmination of unchecked discrimination, racism and hatred over a period of time. Looking the end point in the eye is a good way to remind ourselves of the need to stay alert to the early signs and act quickly to correct them*’ **\(S3\)**. In his public engagements, Sands has constantly forged links between past and present, **explaining both the importance, and limits, of the current legal apparatus for responding to such crimes.** Drawing on insights from *EWS* about the evolution of the definition of genocide, for example, Sands has emphasised how difficult it may be to establish that even horrific persecution reaches the threshold for ‘genocide’. In speeches, interviews and op\-eds on current events, including the mass repression in Xinjiang, Sands has underlined the resulting need to avoid focusing exclusively on the label ‘genocide’, and to pursue through law all mass atrocities as offensive to our shared humanity **\(S5\)**. 

 Sands’ use of the insights and platform offered by *EWS* has **helped persuade government and NGO audiences of the need for a new convention on crimes against humanity**, articles of which have been drafted by the International Law Commission \( **ILC**\) *.* Such a convention—intended as a more extensive parallel to the existing Genocide Convention \(1948\)—would require states parties to criminalise crimes against humanity under national laws \(which only around half of states have done to date\), and to either submit for prosecution or extradite individuals found in their territory and suspected of crimes against humanity, even when the crimes were committed abroad and have no other connection with the state in question. Treaty obligations of this kind would expand prospects for prosecution of crimes against humanity before national tribunals exercising universal jurisdiction, complementing the role of international tribunals like the International Criminal Court. The Special Adviser to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor on Crimes against Humanity and head of the ‘Crimes against Humanity Initiative’ which has, since 2008, spearheaded the campaign for a new treaty, testifies that *EWS*, and Sands’ addresses and performances, have lent ‘ *considerable momentum and gravitas*’ to the project of establishing a new convention. She recalls that ‘ *\[w\]hen we first began* \[the Crimes against Humanity Initiative to press for a new convention\], *many doubted the need for a new treaty on crimes against humanity, because the Genocide Convention was already in force*.’ Sands’ book *EWS* ‘ *underscores why the two crimes* \[crimes against humanity and genocide\] *are different and why both are necessary elements of any attempt to address the problem of mass atrocities*’, and ‘ *helped to transform the conversation around this proposed new treaty*’ **\(S6\)**. The Special Rapporteur leading the drafting project at the ILC testifies that ‘ *in my interactions with governments and non\-governmental actors … it was clear that the book had provided an excellent and engaging history … opening the door to reflections on contemporary atrocities and why it is so important to do something to prevent them*’; and that he has used ‘ *synergies … between \[EWS\] and promotion of the work of the* \[ILC\] *at conferences \[and\] workshops worldwide, including in Addis Ababa, Cairo, Lima, London, New York, Nuremberg, Seoul, and Singapore*’ **\(S7\)**. A new convention is a major endeavour, particularly in current geopolitical circumstances, but, from an inauspicious start, there is a now a vibrant campaign for a new treaty on crimes against humanity. The COVID\-19 pandemic has slowed the calling of a conference to transform the draft articles into a convention, but the topic is on the UN General Assembly agenda for autumn 2021. 

 **\(iii\) Facilitating active practices of memorialisation and commemoration** 

 *EWS* has enabled active commemoration of the Holocaust and legal innovation in response to it. **Public addresses by Sands and screenings of **My Nazi Legacy** to mark Holocaust Memorial Day** **have helped keep the events of the Holocaust, and the imperative to avoid any repetition, to the fore of public attention, including for younger generations** \(e.g. at the University of Glasgow \(2017\), University of Sussex \(2018\) and the Peace Palace \(the Hague\) \(2020\)\). The **new cultural artefacts developed from **EWS** have made possible unique formal and public events**: *A Song of Good and Evil* was performed in the site of the Nuremberg trials, Courtroom 600 of Nuremberg’s Palace of Justice, at the invitation of the German Government, to mark the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the opening of the trials. **Sands’ research has animated events at museums and memorial foundations, helping maintain a vibrant program of public engagement and historical inquiry** \(including at US Holocaust Memorial Museum \(2016, with Niklas Frank, son of leading Nazi\), Ambassador Conference of the Holocaust Educational Trust \(2016\), Montreal Holocaust Museum \(2018\), Imperial War Museum \(London\) \(2018\), and Wiener Library’s *Crimes Uncovered: The First Generation of Holocaust Researchers Uncovered* exhibition \(2019\)\). The Imperial War Museum \(IWM, London\) has included reference to Lauterpacht and Lemkin’s role in post\-WWII criminal justice in its major new Holocaust Galleries \(opening now postponed to autumn 2021\), informed by *EWS*. Suggestions and introductions from Sands to archives and family members are *‘enabling* \[IWM\] *to use and display assets* \[it\] *would not otherwise have been able to access’* **\(S8\)**. 

 The **personal stories in **EWS** have lent commemorative activities an unusual power and resonance in communities globally, from Lviv to Norwich.** At a 2017 conference in Lviv inspired by *EWS*, lawyers, judges, historians and relatives of key protagonists walked from the city centre to the former Jewish ghetto, and unveiled plaques at the houses of Lauterpacht and Lemkin. Some Ukrainian participants reported that the conference had facilitated discussions about the past that had hitherto been difficult, because of different groups’ disparate experiences of violence and persecution under the city’s alternating Soviet occupation \(1939–41\), Nazi occupation \(1941–44\), and Soviet rule \(from 1944\) **\(S9\)**. In addition to reviving stories of well\-known individuals, *EWS* has **brought to light figures otherwise lost to history,** like Elsie Tilney, a Norwich missionary who had carried Sands’ mother as an infant from annexed Austria to Paris, and, while interned in France, protected Jewish internees. Sands’ unearthing of this story led to: Tilney’s recognition as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem \(Israel’s Holocaust remembrance foundation\); a medal presentation by the Israeli Ambassador to a living relative; and a service at Tilney’s church in Norwich, where her story had been entirely unknown **\(S10\)**. 

 **\(iv **\)** Injecting momentum into public reckoning over responsibility for past atrocities** 

 Through this cycle of public engagement, research and cultural production, Sands’ research has **sparked public debate about conceptions of responsibility for past wrongs by family members and co\-nationals of perpetrators**. Most relevantly in this respect, research for *EWS* opened dialogue between Sands and the sons of Nazi leaders Hans Frank \(Governor\-General of occupied Poland\) and Otto von Wächter \(Governor of Lviv\). During Sands’ research for *EWS,* the director David Evans proposed a film about Horst von Wächter \(Otto’s son\), leading ultimately to the award\-winning documentary, *My Nazi Legacy* \(referred to in \(i\) above\). In 2014, Sands moderated a discussion at Southbank Centre between Horst von Wächter, who remained protective of his father, and Niklas Frank, who judged his father harshly. A reviewer of the debate, which had been filmed for the documentary, noted that this was ‘ *the first time* \[the two sons’\] *views had been discussed in public’*; a *‘packed—and surprisingly young—audience*’ listened in ‘ *rather tense silence*’ to von Wächter’s defences of his father, breaking into ‘ *highly\-charged applause*’ at an audience member’s intervention **\(S11\)**. Horst von Wächter’s reference in the course of this discussion to his father being revered in Ukraine in turn prompted further filming of an event in Ukraine celebrating Otto von Wächter’s Waffen SS Division, allowing the documentary to highlight the persistence of far\-right sympathy and activity today. 

 This **cycle of public engagement, research and cultural production has in turn seeded new inquiries over responsibility for past atrocities**. The podcast and subsequent best\-selling book *The Ratline* \(2020\), referred to in \(i\) above, uses the story of Otto von Wächter to open new questions about the complicity of the Vatican and Allied powers in allowing former Nazi leaders to escape justice. Professor Sands’ work has also made available a rich resource of archives from which other scholars may derive insights of their own. Sands facilitated an approach by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum to digitise the von Wächter family archive, and these records have now been made freely available to all online. The Senior Project Director of the Museum’s International Archival Programs Division testifies that it is ‘ *exceedingly rare and difficult to identify personal collections of former Nazi and SS officials, let alone be able to acquire them*’. These records, rare in themselves, ‘ *provide intimate insights*’ into the trajectories of former Nazis in flight. Supplemented by Sands’ painstaking research, these previously unseen historical materials offer ‘ *intellectual access into one of the most secretive and little understood aspects of Holocaust history’* **\(S12\)**, opening a path for others to explore the choices made by Allied governments in dealings with these individuals in the post\-war period.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 For over 20 years, the University of Leicester has played an active role in the field of advanced helicopter control techniques. This research has achieved substantial impact on control system design policies, industrial practices, marketplace performance and professional understanding. 

 Through collaborations with Leonardo Helicopters, Muretex, the Aircraft Research Association, Aerospace Technology Institute, UK Vertical Lift Network and many rotorcraft SMEs, University of Leicester School of Engineering researchers have provided innovative solutions to global industrial issues and created key enabling technologies to facilitate long\-term success in rotorcraft benefitting the international aerospace industry. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The University of Leicester \(UoL\) has, since the 1990s, conducted research into advanced control systems, particularly primary flight systems and the application of robust multivariable control techniques **\[R1, R2, R3\]**. Most of this work was research\-led and supported by the government \(EPSRC, QinetiQ–formerly Defence Evaluation and Research Agency\) and laid the foundations enabling application of control principles to other areas of rotorcraft. Since 2007 **\[R3–R5\]**, the industrial focus has been on the application of advanced control algorithms for vibration reduction resulting in several GBP multi\-million pound research projects including REACT and RTVP **\[G1–G4\]** with extensive UoL involvement. As such, UoL has become one of the UK’s leading centres of excellence for control systems for rotorcraft. 

 **Advanced Vibration Reduction Control Systems** 

 Leonardo helicopters is one of the UK's leading aerospace companies, currently holding around 10.5% of the world rotorcraft market. The collaborative research with UoL focussed on complex vibration reduction problems resulting in the creation of novel advanced multivariable control algorithms **\[R3, R5\].** By applying multiple actuators \(active lag\-dampers, active trailing edge flaps etc.\) to rotor blades, the team were able to reduce vibrations in helicopter fuselages, thereby providing improvements in airworthiness, passenger comfort, environmental impact and maintenance requirements. The experimental tests for DLR’s \(Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raum\-fahrt e.V.—German Aerospace Center\) novel multiple\-swashplate rotor concepts designed during this research collaboration are now internationally adopted control practices. 

 **Control System Design for the National Rotor Test Facility \(NTRF\)** 

 The NRTF rig is unique in featuring a tilting rotating mechanical system that enables wind tunnel experiments for a wide set of new rotor blades and configurations. This is reliant on the new control laws pioneered at UoL.Valued at over GBP5M, the facility supports fundamental research relevant to helicopters, tiltrotors and turbo\-prop aircraft, as well as emerging personal flying machines, Urban and/or Regional Air Mobility Systems, electric Vertical Take\-Off and Landing vehicles, Unmanned Air Vehicles \(UAVs\), other rotary\-wing vehicles \(autogyros, rotodynes, turbo\-props\) and even wind turbines of various types. The rig is powered by an electric motor, which can provide up to 77kW and allows a maximum rotational speed of 3500rpm while its shaft angle can vary between \-20 and 90 degrees \(measured with respect to a vertical axis\). 

 The NRTF rig and accompanying hardware is designed for portability, enabling its use in wind tunnels nationwide. Its purpose is to allow *dynamic* testing of rotor blades, which can be exploited by practitioners in industry and UK\-based researchers. The NRTF will be one of only a handful of such facilities globally, providing a unique asset for UK and worldwide rotorcraft stakeholders. 

 The NRTF construction has two phases. Phase 1 is now complete and provides the hardware and rig control systems incorporating UoL’s novel set of control laws to regulate tilting and trimming of the rig. The control system has been validated and shown to work at all specified wind\-speeds and configurations **\[R4\]**. Building on the successful completion of phase I, phase II is underway funded by the GBP3,500,000 EPSRC MENtOR project **\[G5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The UK is a world leader in aerospace technology, but global competition is intensifying. The combined rotorcraft world market for the next decade is significant and hence key to the national economy, with a projected production of more than 17,600 rotorcraft worth an estimated USD202,000,000,000 in 2018 \(Forecast International\). The national helicopter industry is deeply embedded in the UK’s industrial base, directly employing more than 7,300 people, generating national revenues of more than GBP2,300,000,000 and exports worth GBP1.3B yearly, and supporting the work of more than 2,300 companies in the supply chain. Although increasing demand for new civil rotorcraft is expected to more than offset the anticipated decline or plateau in military demand, in order to maintain or improve, the UK needs to generate unique innovations. Research conducted at UoL is making important contributions to this objective. 

 **Enabling Long Term World\-Leading Rotorcraft Innovation in the UK** 

 The NRTF rotor rig is a physical mechanical/software mechanism, unique in the UK, that enables performance optimisation studies of rotor blades and their impact on rotor\-vehicle aerodynamics, facilitating more efficient blade and body designs, reduced noise, improved airworthiness and better handling qualities. 

 The rotor blade control is governed by the unique algorithms developed by UoL, which have changed rotor blade design processes and increased capabilities for manufacturers to test the safety of the design. These algorithms were based on “ *advanced novel H\-infinity methods which were able to accurately control the rig pitch when implemented on the rig satisfying the required accuracy demands*” **\[E4\].** They are “ *one of the key enabling technologies*” for the NRTF according to the Aerospace Technology Institute **\[E2\]**. 

 The test rig can also be used for other rotor\-related studies, including new actuator technologies and flight algorithms, and enabling fundamental research of rotorcraft phenomena not yet well understood, such as whirl flutter, which can have catastrophic consequences for the operation of new vehicles operating at higher speeds. The rig is unique in the UK and is key to boosting the UK's vertical lift capabilities in an increasingly competitive market. “ *The participation of the University of Leicester has been vital in the construction of the National Rotor Rig Test Facility*” \(Aircraft Research Association\) **\[E1\]**. 

 UoL research has significantly improved industrial understanding and awareness of advanced control design methodologies; notable examples of this include the Aircraft Research Association \(ARA\) for the NRTF rig and Muretex for the entire control system. ARA is an independent research and development organisation providing a range of specialist services to the global aerospace industry including aerodynamic design and consultancy, computational fluid dynamics, high precision wind tunnel model design and transonic wind tunnel testing. As a result of collaboration with UoL, ARA were able to “ *greatly increase our awareness and understanding of their novel control algorithms some of which have been fully implemented into the NRTF and experimentally tested”* and they also comment favourably on the algorithm’s *“excellent performance, meeting demands of less than 0.1\-degree accuracy for the rotor shaft tilting motion*” **\[E3\].** The result of this collaboration is that operators now understand the use and benefits of the UoL algorithms with ARA stating that “ *These algorithms alleviate the operator’s workload significantly, hence improving the safety under standard operation*” **\[E3\]**. 

  

 Systems engineering company Muretex specialise in augmenting human performance through automation and control systems development and are a partner in the NRTF development. In addition to algorithm development, UoL provided Muretex with *“advanced know\-how to the control systems team, which allowed the implementation of algorithms crucial to the rigs’ functionality*” and unique contributions that “ *not only enabled rig functionality to be achieved, but also enhanced the appreciation of advanced control techniques by Muretex personnel*”. As a result, the Muretex control system development toolbox is now “ *more complete thanks to the collaboration with Leicester*” **\[E4\].** 

 **Changing Aircraft Design Processes, Policies and Opening New Markets** 

 Excessive vibration in rotorcraft causes a multitude of significant issues including making pilot control more difficult causing reduced flight quality, rotorcraft reliability and flight safety, increasing fuel consumption through reduced efficiency and negatively affecting passenger comfort and experience. New algorithms developed at UoL **\[E1, E2, R5\]** provide 50\-75% reduction in vibration compared to standard industrial methods whilst also guaranteeing increased reliability. This is accomplished through a combination of more accurate robust stability tests and having low\-order and a **single** set of control algorithms operating over the flight envelope. This facilitates the system’s certification for production and provides an economical computational infrastructure. 

 Leonardo is one of the biggest suppliers of defence and security equipment to the UK Ministry of Defence. It makes a significant contribution to the UK economy with revenues of over GBP2,000,000,000, around 50% of which are in exports. According to Leonardo: *“\[Morales’\] expertise in advanced control system design for vibration reduction highlighted the importance of actuator limitations and how comprehensive algorithms that take this information into account can be exploited to further improve both airworthiness and performance with respect to existing methods*” **\[E1\]**. 

 Leonardo confirmed that the results of the collaboration are now “ *applied to vibration mitigation systems currently operating on our products, such as the Active Control of Structural Response \(ACSR\) system*” **\[E2\]** which are included as key selling points on the AW101, AW169 and AW139 helicopters **\[E5\]**. As of October 2020, Leonardo had sold 71 AW101 machines as well as at least 450 AW169 and 1100 AW139 units generating revenues of up to USD23,900,000,000 **\[E6\]**. 

 The Aerospace Technology Institute \(ATI\) promotes transformative technology in air transport through substantial research and development funding and responsibility for defining the technology strategy for the UK aerospace sector. UoL research and involvement has achieved significant impact on ATI through providing “ *new understanding and awareness into \[their\] design methods*’ leading to *‘impact on policies and design procedures for both the UK Aerospace Strategy and for the rotorcraft industry in the UK*” **\[E1, E2\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the Department of Physics at Lancaster University has pioneered the use of quantum effects in semiconductor nanostructures in hardware security devices. These include a tag incorporating quantum materials, from which a unique fingerprint can be read optically; a device for electronic authentication, where an identity is generated from process variations in semiconductor diodes; and an electronic random number generator, whose output is based on quantum tunnelling. A spin\-out company, Quantum Base Ltd. \(QBL\), was incorporated in April 2013 and officially began co\-development and commercialisation activities in conjunction with Lancaster University in August 2014, when the two parties co\-signed master licensing and commercialisation agreements. QBL, which is located in rented office space within the Physics building at Lancaster University, has grown from being a new company at the start of the current REF period, into a pioneer of the nascent field of quantum security, with a value defined by private investment in excess of GBP10.0 million. QBL is responsible for creating 15 jobs and holds 15 patents \(granted in a variety of territories\), with 32 patents pending. QBL has engaged the anti\-counterfeiting industry through features in three industry publications, and developed mass\-market fabrication processes at OpSec Security Ltd. \(OSL\), a major hologram manufacturer. Commercialisation agreements have been made with two significant manufacturers of anti\-counterfeiting tags, and licenses to produce 10 million security tags have been sold. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the impacts in this case study was conducted at Lancaster University in projects led by Young, who is listed as an inventor on 45 of the 47 granted and pending patents held by QBL. Young’s research focuses on devices containing semiconductor nanostructures for applications in information security. 

####  2.1 Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> 

 The concept of using imperfections in electronic and optical devices to specify their identities, known as physical unclonable functions \(PUFs\), gained popularity in the early 2000s. The appeal of these devices is striking; randomness inherent in a structure, or introduced during fabrication, is more complex than deterministically programmed or manufactured uniqueness. In 2014, Young’s research, funded through a University Research Fellowship from the Royal Society \[QI1\] developed the first PUFs that derive their identity from atomic imperfections, known as quantum PUFs. These were later trademarked as Q\-ID<sup>®</sup>s. Compared to previous technologies, this innovation boasts several key advantages. Fingerprinting at the atomic scale makes the engineering challenge of producing counterfeits as difficult as possible, while utilising quantum effects that grow as feature sizes reduce makes it easier to read individual signatures. Additionally, by measuring additional physical properties, the dimensionality of the physics underlying fingerprint generation can be verified, and thus cloning\-based attacks can be prevented. The technology was developed by Young in two distinct variants: Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Electronic \[3.1\] and Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Optical \[3.2\]. The electronic Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> device, shown on the right in the figure below, is connected to a USB interface, but the final implementation will be fully integrated. The optical Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> tag on the top left\-hand side of the figure is embedded within a surface coating on a hologram, which is shown below it. 



 In a seminal 2015 paper \[3.1\], the first use of quantum confinement to uniquely identify a simple electronic device was demonstrated. In this work, it was shown that unique identities can be extracted from current peaks in resonant tunnelling diodes. Despite being fabricated using ultra\-high\-precision epitaxial processes, small variations in the width and composition of the quantum well in these devices lead to variations in their physical properties that are effectively magnified by the quantum physics governing their behaviour. A patent broadly covering the concept of using quantum confinement for authentication, first filed in 2014, has been granted in the UK, China, Japan and the US \[3.3\]. Additional patent applications were filed in 2016 \(also granted\) to cover the use of networked Q\-ID’s for communication security, and as a hardware lock for integrated circuits to physically enable/disable logical elements. This later work was supported by grants from the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research \[QI2 and QI3\]. 

 Research led by Young demonstrated an optical analogue of this technology in 2017, where variations in the band gap of quantum materials on a surface, or locked in a polymer, were used to generate unique fingerprints \[3.2\]. A patent for this concept filed in 2015 \[3.4\] has now been granted in the UK and US, and additional method and device patents have been filed and granted since, to protect IP relating to its practical implementation. A PhD student developing the technology with Young at Lancaster University won a prestigious award from EPSRC for his work \[QI4\]. In 2020, it was also demonstrated that similar concepts can be employed with materials that are biocompatible and food\-safe, paving the way for directly utilising the technology on products that are ingested, such as pills. 

####  2.2 Q\-RAND<sup>®</sup> 

 Random number generators \(RNGs\) are important in diverse applications such as cryptography, simulations, testing \( *e.g*. selecting samples from a population for assessing drug efficacy\), digital address generation and gaming. Limits in the way current digital systems choose random numbers leaves everyone vulnerable to hacking, causing large\-scale information breaches. It has been demonstrated that truly random numbers can be obtained from different sources such as noise, chaotic systems and quantum phenomena. The main advantage of using a quantum noise source is its intrinsic uncertainty, as opposed to the predictability of classical sources of noise, and Young’s team proposed and demonstrated that quantum tunnelling in a simple semiconductor structure could be used as an RNG in 2017 \[3.5\]. These devices are practical, scalable sources of randomness whose behaviour is governed by quantum physics at room temperature. The semiconductor nature of RTDs and the simple system proposed to read random numbers from them, make them a promising candidate for integration into microelectronic systems. The potential to integrate single\-element RNGs into current technologies makes them resistant to frequency injection and biasing attacks, as tampering with them is prohibitively difficult. The output of these devices can be directly used as a random stream of bits, or can be further distilled using randomness extraction algorithms, depending on the application. Two patents were filed in 2016 to protect these concepts \[3.6\], both of which have since been granted in the UK. Prototype devices were produced with support from Impact Acceleration Awards made to Lancaster University by EPSRC and a peer\-reviewed grant from the Royal Society \[QI5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 To date, the primary impact of the research is on the Lancaster spin\-out, QBL, which is currently located in office space rented from the Physics Department at Lancaster University \[5.1\]. Co\-founded by Young \(Chief Scientific Officer\) and Philip Speed \(Chief Executive Officer\), QBL was incorporated in April 2013, but commercialisation and licensing agreements with Lancaster were not signed until 2014, meaning that all the value \(impact\) generated by QBL occurred during the current REF period. During this time, working in very close cooperation with Young’s research team in the Physics Department at Lancaster University, QBL has developed novel, low\-cost quantum security solutions suitable for mass\-market applications in areas such as authentication and secure communication. QBL has established itself as a pioneer in the nascent quantum security market, founded on the novel and robust underpinning research described in Section 2. The company’s commercial success is built on the fact that current security devices on the market base their signatures on classical macroscopic physics; whereas technologies developed by QBL are dominated by quantum mechanics. The difference: due to the quantum nature of the device and no reliance on keys, attacks such as cloning and copying are not practically feasible. QBL is now directly engaged in product development with global Tier 1 companies, as described in sections 4.1 and 4.2 below, though some cannot be named in this document due to strict confidentiality agreements that are in place. 

 As a result of this activity, and following several rounds of private investment, the company is now estimated to be worth more than GBP10.0 million \[5.1, 5.2\]. This valuation was derived from a combination of factors including the market potential for QBL’s solutions, agreements made between QBL and its production partners, licenses sold, and the successful completion of a contract and external trial with a US West Coast\-based multinational technology company. Additionally, the valuation is validated by the investment rate at which experienced technology investors have bought into QBL. QBL recently sold 10 million licenses to a multi\-national security label manufacturer for them to create tags based on QBL’s intellectual property \[5.1\]. Independent patent landscaping analyses, focusing on the nascent field of quantum technologies, have ranked QBL’s portfolio highly \(top 20\) with respect to some major world\-leading companies \[5.3, 5.4\]. As QBL has expanded since its inception, 15 jobs have been created. 

####  4.1 Impact of Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> 

 Counterfeiting and forgery of digital identities are two of the costliest crimes in the world today. Counterfeiting is a problem that is ubiquitous to almost all products. The Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development \(OECD\) estimates that the global trade for counterfeit goods cost industry USD200.0 billion in 2005 and has grown to an estimated USD461.0 billion today \[ [OECD website](https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/trade-in-fake-goods-is-now-33-of-world-trade-and-rising.htm)\]. Digital identity counterfeiting and device spoofing are rapidly becoming more acute problems. As the Internet of Things \(IoT\) expands, the need to trust the identity of smart systems, such as the brake systems in connected cars, becomes vital. The specific impacts of QBL’s two families of Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> products, Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Optical and Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Electronic, are given below. 

 **Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Optical:  QBL and Lancaster University are working with OSL to integrate Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Optical into mass\-market security holograms and QR codes \[5.5\], based on research conducted at Lancaster University since 2017 \[3.2\]. OSL is the market leader in fighting counterfeits for brands, transaction cards, and government documents and currency, supplying thousands of companies across different industry sectors and 50 governments worldwide. Three rounds of in\-factory trials with OSL have been successfully completed and a final product development stage is underway. The final product, a tag with a surface coating containing quantum materials, has a target cost of less than GBP0.01 per unit, which is between 10 and 100 times less than existing RFID\-based solutions with which it competes. 

 Verification of authenticity with Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Optical will be with a smartphone; using its flash to excite emission from the tag and its camera to collect an identity and signature of quantum emission. This enables a mass\-market uptake and the power to confirm products are genuine by anyone in possession of a smartphone. QBL is currently working with a leading smartphone manufacturer to facilitate this solution. The importance of this anti\-counterfeiting solution to the general consumer base is demonstrated by broad media coverage of Young’s publications by Sky, The Times, New Scientist and BBC’s Tomorrow’s World \[5.6\], which has reached over 8 million people. Important niche publications targeting policymakers and industry members have also published articles on this technology, including Trading Standards Review,  [Trading Standards Today](http://portfolio.cpl.co.uk/TS-Today/201709/feature/) and  [Semiconductor Engineering](https://semiengineering.com/startup-puts-quantum-security-on-usb-dongles/) \[5.7\]. 

 **Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> Electronic:** QBL is pursuing the application of its electronic variant of Q\-ID<sup>®</sup> to increase the security of electronic devices, to prevent problems such as device spoofing. The first demonstrators of this technology were made using III\-V semiconductors in 2015 \[3.1\], which are typically used for optoelectronics and in more niche applications, such as, *e.g*., high\-speed filters. For III\-V implementation, QBL is working with one of the largest semiconductor fabrication companies in the world to develop a product. However, as silicon dominates electronics, they are also translating the technology to devices that can be readily implemented into standard silicon \(complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor, CMOS\) processing, working in conjunction with a major semiconductor foundry. 

####  4.2 Impact of Q\-RAND<sup>®</sup> 

 To realise commercially ready technology from Lancaster University research \[3.5\], QBL is pursuing a strategy to embed Q\-RAND<sup>®</sup> within new devices. In particular, small embedded systems, such as IoT devices, vastly outnumber conventional computers. Cisco estimated the number of IP connected devices to be over 18 billion in 2018, and forecast it to rise 50% by 2023 \[from Cisco’s Annual Internet Report ‘ [Cisco Annual Internet Report \(2018–2023\) White Paper, 2020’](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/executive-perspectives/annual-internet-report/white-paper-c11-741490.html?fbclid=IwAR0g6h6qCbieO1_mRk1KCS2jRMxInVfo5xNAAdVMKVC7OuVWFF19yxoi6mI)\]. Every IoT device requires an RNG to communicate securely, to generate cryptographic keys for specific sessions, and for operational efficiently, to schedule windows in which to transmit data, minimising clashes with other devices. A prototype of a CMOS\-compatible structure has been implemented in silicon, and work is currently underway to integrate the technology in existing semiconductor fabrication processes for next\-generation IoT devices.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Mapping Immigration Controversy research project \(MIC\), with Jones as PI, challenged the UK's 'hostile environment' policy which makes life increasingly hard for marginalised groups, by collecting, analysing, and sharing sociological research through a socially engaged, co\-productive approach. Working with civil society organisations, MIC demonstrably **changed how local authorities, schools and other agencies engage with migration, discrimination, and shifting borders**. MIC findings were **used to build community networks and solidarity**, while research\-based interventions, from public meetings to artistic production, **supported empowerment to change prejudiced attitudes**. MIC's research has **informed school curriculums** and been **used as evidence for recommendations by a UN Rapporteur.**

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Mapping Immigration Controversy \(MIC\)'s inception was as a response to a pressing national controversy where research evidence was sorely lacking. The Home Office's 'hostile environment' on immigration turned a corner in the summer of 2013, by taking actions designed to publicise the increasing checks on immigration status such as the infamous 'Go Home van' \- an advertising hoarding driven around ethnically diverse areas of London asking 'In the UK illegally? Go Home or Face Arrest'. While Ministers claimed not to recognise the salience of 'Go Home' as a racially\-loaded phrase, its implications of blurring further the line between immigration control and racial profiling was obvious to many, inciting widespread press coverage which often linked this initiative to government attempts to challenge UKIP's rising popularity. 

 Recognising the urgency of this moment, Jones was instrumental in gathering a group of anti\-racist feminist researchers committed to using their social research skills to further social justice, broaden and deepen the debate, and influence policy. Forming an alliance between 8 researchers at 6 universities, and with 13 civil society organisations, Jones as PI led a successful bid to the ESRC's Urgent Grants competition \(see Section 3\), demonstrating UKRI’s recognition of the urgent need for research into the broader effects of these government campaigns. 

 The resulting MIC research used focus groups, interviews, public feedback sessions, and a national survey \(commissioned from Ipsos\-MORI\) to identify and analyse the ongoing effects of government publicity campaigns on immigration. Designed and carried out in concert with local and national migrant support and anti\-racist organisations, impact was built into MIC from the start. Outputs were produced from early in the project ranging from multiple engagement events and ongoing sociological blogs \( [www.mappingimmigrationcontroversy.com](http://www.mappingimmigrationcontroversy.com/), see below for 

 reach\), interim reports designed for policy audiences, and more formal peer\-reviewed outputs, including a co\-authored monograph from Manchester University Press, for which Jones was lead author \(3.1\). 

 Key findings from the research \(see 3.1, 3.2, 3,3\) which led to the impacts detailed here were: 

 2.1\) Government communications on immigration control are not evidence\-based 

 2.2\) Government campaigns on immigration provoked or increased anger and fear, including among people opposed to immigration 2.3\) Government campaigns on immigration seemed to provoke new pro\-migrant activism, but there was not always solidarity between those targeted by anti\-immigration campaigns 

 2.4\) Those with insecure immigration status often found it hard to participate in political debate because of real or perceived threats to their residency 

 2.5\) Many people experienced harassment for being 'illegal immigrants' when they had settled status, or were British citizens, and associated this with the hostile environment. 

 In short, government communications on migration were found to increase division and hostility and insecurity, for both migrants and British citizens.

 'The anti\-immigrant push is like a juggernaut\!' 

 These are the words of Pragna Patel, Director of Southall Black Sisters \(SBS\), which seeks to empower Black and South Asian women \(5.1\). In this 'anti\-immigrant' context, MIC has made changes in grassroots understanding and institutional practices relating to resisting the hostile environment, including supporting the UN's attempt to influence UK border enforcement \(5.2, 5.3\). Patel describes changes made by MIC on herself, the women she works with, her organisation, and the sector, specifically in relation to: **organisational practice**; **community networks and solidarity** in the face of the hostile environment; and **individual prejudice and empowerment**: 

 '*The research was timely… this is a deprived area and it is easy for people to blame each other. The research was one way of doing sustained community work, of flagging those divisions and challenging them'* \(5.1\). 

 The interest in MIC has been widespread and significant \(5.6, 5.9\). Impact reached national and international levels to **inform and shape international policy debates and national school curriculums** \(5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5\). 

 **Changing Organisational Practice to Challenge the Hostile Environment**Rita Chadha, as Chief Executive of RAMFEL \(Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London\) referred local authorities and community safety partners to MIC findings \(2.1\-2.5\) and *'noted a shift in the views of public agencies who have become more receptive to discussions as a result'* \(5.8\). She added: 

 I think that the research did challenge local agencies, by providing official and credible verification of community concerns. \(5.8\) 

 Chadha observed this having followed changes to local and regional agencies' operation after MIC researchers \(Jones and Gunaratnam\) attended her local Community Safety Partnership to present their research findings and discuss their implications, and her own use of MIC findings in negotiations towards local agencies using less hostile communications about migrants. 

 Through *Immigration Otherwise* \(a sub\-project arising from MIC\), theatre group *ActREAL* devised a script with pupils at two schools, based on MIC findings, particularly 2.2 and 2.5 above. Over ten weekly workshops at Westwood Academy, Coventry and Cheney School, Oxford, 25 students aged 13\-15 and their teachers learned about and questioned migration controversies, interacting with verbatim transcripts from the research and with the researchers and *ActReal*. The young people performed their devised plays to teachers, families and peers, dealing with questions of hostility, discrimination, suspicion, empathy, solidarity and resistance in response to research findings 2.1\-2.5. After the performance, the young actors, their audience and MIC researchers discussed the issues raised. An independent evaluator found this led to changes in school practice: 

 *'inspired the teachers to use more academic research in their planning and teaching to explore socially engaged or ""taboo"" topics in the curriculum with other year groups.'* \(5.7\) 

 **Building Networks and Solidarity to Channel Civic Engagement**MIC's co\-produced character enabled third sector organisations to develop networks, solidarity and practice in response to MIC findings about fractures in pro\-migrant activism provoked by government anti\-immigration campaigns \(2.3\) and the limitations on civic activity experienced by migrants feeling under threat \(2.4\). At least 18 third sector organisations worked directly with the project on the research and its application, and more than forty organisations participated in events and workshops on the research. Pragna Patel \(SBS\) reflected that: 

 We can say for sure that being part of this … helped us to develop our own thinking … the events embedded our group in community structures and processes… as a follow\-up… we organised a debate \[for local people in Southall\] on the elections and political parties and we did a lot of work on building understanding and empathy towards all migrants. \(5.1\) 

 Attending the performance and discussion of *Immigration Otherwise* increased the inclination of family, friends and peers of participants to solidarity with challenging the hostile environment, reflected in comments such as: 

 'It definitely taught me something \- I didn't have an opinion about this but the way people are being treated I definitely do have an opinion now.' \(5.7\) 

 **Challenging Prejudice and Supporting Empowerment** MIC empowered members of the public to challenge the hostile environment in everyday life, boosting the confidence and evidence used even by those already engaged in migrant support, such as this former Chair of the Scottish Refugee Council: 

 Your research made me more likely to challenge misinformation and misunderstandings. I was on a train shortly after reading the results and my fellow passenger was reading a Daily Mail feature about immigration. I shared some of the findings from your research with her. \(5.8\) 

 Others told us that MIC had empowered them to create tangible outputs, as in this testimony from an End of Project Conference participant, in a follow\-up survey four years on: 

 Because of this exposure, I now give thought to how I treat others who are experiencing immigration issues, not making assumptions. I feel a greater sense of confidence when discussing these subject matters, and I am happy to speak up for others and myself when facing immigration challenges. For example, I developed a podcast addressing some of the inaccuracies portrayed in the media regarding the Syrian refugee crisis. \(5.8\) 

 Young people involved in *Immigration Otherwise* shifted their thoughts from before the project when they were unaware or unengaged in migrant justice issues \(e.g. *'Refugees are something to do with the army'*; *'Is an asylum seeker someone who is mentally ill?'*; *'I don't think we have responsibilities yet but we should still think about it. I think we are too young'*\) \(5.7\) 

 After taking part, their comments indicated they had re\-evaluated personal agency and citizenship duties and developed their thinking about the intersections of immigration and social inequality, with comments such as: 

 *'I feel like now I can put myself in their shoes.'* 

 *'We don't have the power to change things but we do have the power to spread awareness, to talk to people.'* \(5.7\) 

 Teachers at both schools described short, medium and long term sustained effects of the project, for example: 

 *'Students became more aware of immigration issues, more perceptive, offering well thought out comments in discussions. We can see a huge impact in the students' confidence after taking part in this project.'* \(5.7\) 

 **Shaping School Curriculum and Policy Debates**MIC reached beyond those directly participating in events through journalistic coverage on major news platforms, including the *Financial Times* and Radio 4, and invited contributions to mainstream media, including a *London Review of Books* cover feature \(5.10\). The MIC Twitter account has over 1,500 followers, including most of the major migration campaigning organisations and activists in the UK and many key international organisations, and the project website has had over 34,000 views from over 19,800 visitors from 150 countries between 2014 and 2020. 

 Significant impacts resulted from this extensive reach: 

 Jones was invited to contribute a page on MIC to *Our Migration Story*, a secondary school curriculum resource designed to fit with the National Curriculum in History and the prioritisation of Spiritual, Moral, Social, and Cultural \(SMSC\) development across Key Stages. The entry on 'responses to migration in Britain today' focuses exclusively on MIC findings and provides the most contemporary history within the resource. *Our Migration Story* has won multiple prestigious awards for impact and public engagement \(5.5\). 

 The **United Nations Special Rapporteur on Racism** visited the UK in April and May 2018. The official report on this visit used MIC evidence to highlight the connections between racism and migration control within the UK \(5.2, point 54\). The racialised effects of the hostile environment beyond irregular migrants which the Rapporteur drew from MIC evidence was highlighted in national press coverage of her report, informing public debate \(5.4\). Recommendations to the UN included that the UK Government should *'Assess and eliminate the racially disparate impact of immigration laws and policies.'* \(5.2, point 74\(m\)\). This directly relates to the MIC evidence, particularly finding 2.5. 

 Despite the 'juggernaut' of 'the anti\-immigrant push', MIC's co\-produced research approach changed minds and lives by developing and sharing robust evidence of the effects of government anti\-immigration campaigns on everyday experiences, and co\-creating spaces in which organisations, groups and individuals were able to challenge the hostile environment through building networks of understanding and solidarity.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Difficulties with India’s urban waste management systems have caused significant environmental, health, and social justice problems for people living in its cities. Professor Fiona Marshall’s research has directly altered urban waste management policy and practice – by devising and promoting sustainable, decentralised approaches that bring benefits for the environment, economy and society, in addition to supporting the livelihoods of some of India’s millions of wastepickers. The research team worked with stakeholders to influence a key piece of Indian national waste management legislation, and also collaborated with NGOs to facilitate unprecedented partnerships across the formal and informal sectors, leading to improvements and innovations in practice as well as policy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

####  2.1 The problem 

 The research set out to find solutions to India’s growing urban waste management crisis. An estimated 90% of waste in India is dumped in public spaces, causing a host of environmental and health problems. Waste\-to\-energy \(WTE\) technologies, which involve incineration, have become India’s preferred mainstream solution in recent years. WTE displaces rather than removes environmental hazards and puts additional pressure on marginalised communities and livelihoods. It fails to recognise the vital role played by the estimated 1.5 million informal wastepickers working in Indian cities. By collecting waste and selling recyclable materials, wastepickers reduce Delhi’s daily waste disposal load by at least 1500 metric tonnes \(MT\) \(from a total of 8,360 MT\) and prevent around 932,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions every year. Delhi’s waste pickers also added a social value of about 3.5 billion rupees \(around £38 million\) to the city’s economy in 2002\-3. The focus on WTE has attracted widespread opposition due to increased air pollution, a lack of regulatory control over emissions, and the fact that recyclable waste is sought by WTE plants, leading to lower recycling rates and reducing wastepickers’ incomes. It has been estimated that Delhi’s three WTE plants would cause 300,000 wastepickers to lose their livelihoods. 

####  2.2 The research process 

 Professor Fiona Marshall has been leading a programme of transdisciplinary research concerning urban and peri\-urban sustainability in Asia for the past two decades. The programme has engaged diverse stakeholders in participatory and mixed methods social science research to analyse how sustainability is defined and sought in diverse, risk\-prone and dynamic urban contexts. It has examined the social and political infrastructures that create and reinforce particular mainstream development trajectories, and the complex governance arrangements that influence outcomes for the environment and for poor and marginalized communities. 

 Marshall’s research has assessed the potential for alternative urban development trajectories that can enhance environmental integrity and social justice \[ **R5**\], as well as studying the role of transdisciplinary action research in realising this potential \[ **R4**\]. As part of the wider programme of work, Marshall led a project on urban waste management in India between 2011 and 2015 \[ **R1**\]. The project involved working with local partners including Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, the NGO Toxics Link and two wastepickers’ associations, and was funded as part of the £9 million ESRC investment in the Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability \(STEPS\) Centre, which is co\-led by the University of Sussex and the Institute for Development Studies \[ **G2**\]. The research sought to understand: 

-  What processes are involved in the prioritisation of particular policy options and technological interventions for solid waste management? 

-  Who gains and who loses from current solid waste management interventions? 

-  What alternative environmental management scenarios, institutional and regulatory arrangements – as well as forms of citizen action – could help to provide healthy, secure livelihoods for urban and peri\-urban residents? 

 **R1** describes the transdisciplinary action research process, which involved focus groups, workshops and semi\-structured interviews with residents, NGOs and government officials, as well as shadowing wastepickers through their daily routine. These methods ensured that the core beneficiaries of the research were engaged from the outset and enabled the team to explore a diverse range of narratives and understand the evolution and the implications of the current centralised waste management approach. Case studies in the Indian cities of Ahmedabad and Pune enabled the researchers to compare the WTE approach in Delhi with grassroots innovations in other areas. 

 Other projects led by Marshall that support sustainable urban development in the Global South include **R3**, funded by the Ecosystem Services and Poverty Alleviation Programme \(a £40.5 million programme supported by RCUK and the Department for International Development\) \[ **G1**\], and an ongoing project funded by the British Academy under the Urban Infrastructures of Well\-Being initiative \[ **G3**\]. 

####  2.3 Research findings and insights 

 Through interactions with the various stakeholders in the Delhi project \[ **R1**\], it became clear that the current WTE approach simply displaces health hazards across time, space and social groups, and exacerbates social justice concerns. Key insights included: 

-  The official understanding of urban waste management fails to recognise the complex flows of waste and related risks. As a result, environment, health and residents’ livelihoods are being threatened, and innovative solutions are overlooked. 

-  Despite the recent dominance of the private sector in urban waste management, the informal sector continues to be deeply involved. This reveals a need to include wastepickers in the system, including giving them space to segregate waste and protection from health hazards. 

-  Some waste needs large\-scale technical interventions, but degradable household waste can be processed locally with solutions such as composting and bio\-methanation. 

 The team propose an alternative, sustainable approach to urban waste management and regulation that includes a central role for the informal sector, increased opportunities to reuse and recycle, and more localised initiatives to handle degradable waste. They distilled their insights into eight principles \[ **R2**\], summarised as follows **:** 

1.  Waste is not just an environmental policy and regulation issue. 

1.  Waste flows are more complex than the official system recognises. 

1.  Environmental health and social justice challenges are distributed throughout the waste chain. 

1.  Privatisation creates new conflicts with the informal sector, which could be mitigated by hybrid arrangements and partnerships. 

1.  Decentralisation solutions can be used alongside centralised approaches. 

1.  Incentive structures could support more sustainable options. 

1.  Possibilities for constructive engagements in policymaking, planning and implementation exist. 

1.  Environmental and social justice movements offer key insights into alternative waste management pathways but must be supported to collaborate constructively.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Professor Marshall’s research has directly improved the way that waste is managed in India – both by shaping national policy and by inspiring the significant informal sector to develop successful new initiatives in waste management practice. 

####  4.1 Shaping national policy 

 Through sustained engagement and collaboration with organisations including India’s Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change \(MoEFCC\), Professor Marshall and the research team used their findings to inform and shape new national waste management legislation – the Municipal Solid Waste \(MSW\) Rules \[ **S1**\]. This legislation, formulated by the MoEFCC, is critical in determining how waste is collected, segregated, stored, processed and disposed of in Indian cities. 

 When the draft legislation was published for public consultation in October 2013, the research team, through its NGO collaborator Toxics Link, submitted a set of formal objections. The submission referred to the research findings and highlighted how the planned legislation overlooked opportunities for more sustainable waste management strategies. In January 2014, following the submission of objections, the team organised a policy stakeholder forum to discuss the issues. Attendees included senior officials from MoEFCC, the Ministry of Urban Development \(now Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs \(MoHUA\)\), and the Central Pollution Control board \(CPCB\). 

 As a result of the objections and the forum discussions, \[text removed for publication\] of Toxics Link was invited to join a four\-person government committee, coordinated by the MoEFCC to redraft the Rules \[ **S2**\]. \[text removed for publication\] of the committee, explains the extent of this influence: “I had a privilege to have extensive interaction and critical inputs from expert committee member \[text removed for publication\] \(Toxics Link, New Delhi\) in drafting the Rules” \[ **S3**\]. \[text removed for publication\] describes how the research from Sussex directly fed into the amended MSW Rules: 

 “My contribution in the Expert Committee largely drew from the earlier work on solid waste management by Toxics Link and from a collaborative research project on urban waste management with Professor Fiona Marshall from the University of Sussex… Most of these points were incorporated in the final version of the Rules.” \[ **S4**\] 

 In May 2015, the project team presented a policy brief \[ **R2**\] to government officials and representatives from wastepickers’ associations, NGOs, industry and resident welfare associations. The brief provided a timely reference for the redrafting of the MSW Rules. The final MSW Rules \[ **S1**\], adopted by the Government of India in 2016, represent a significant change in the overarching framework within which waste management policies and plans must be developed across Indian cities. They draw extensively on the research team’s insights – proposing a stronger role for the informal sector, increased recycling and an end to the practice of simply moving hazardous waste from wealthy to poorer areas – and reflect the eight principles outlined above. For example, they: 

-  Move beyond an ‘environmental policy only’ perspective on urban waste \(in line with principle 1\) to include many new stakeholders \[ **S1**, clause 5\] 

-  Recognise the crucial role of informal wastepickers \(principle 4\) \[ **S1**, clause 11c and 15c\] 

-  Include greater recognition of the benefits of decentralised technologies such as bio\-methanation and composting for organic waste \(principle 5\) \[ **S1**, clause 4\(7\) and clause 8\] 

-  Explicitly require communities to be involved in waste management and promote decentralised processing \(principle 5\) \[ **S1**, clause 11\(h\), clause 15\(m\) and clause15\(t\)\] 

-  Support the agricultural use of fertilizers produced from organic wastes \(principle 6\) \[ **S1**, clause 4\(7\) and clause 8\]. 

 The new MSW Rules have led directly to changes in the way waste is dealt with. For example, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi \(MCD\) has planned 10 decentralised waste management plants across the city. The plants use a newly developed technology to treat urban organic waste such as household and food waste. The process generates high\-quality manure as well as producing a biogas, which can be used to make electricity. The first of the ten plants, which began operating in February 2019, is currently treating 5 tonnes of organic waste – and generating 800 units of electricity and around 800kg of organic manure – per day \[ **S5**\]. 

####  4.2 Inspiring innovative practices 

 In addition to the formal influence on policy, the research team worked with NGOs and wastepickers to inspire new approaches and practices in day\-to\-day waste collection and processing. These local initiatives are an example of the new MSW Rules being put into action. 

 The All India Kabadi Mazdoor Mahasangh \(AIKMM\) – a national waste pickers’ association with more than 16,000 members in the Delhi region – has been working closely with the research team since 2013. This has led to successful new waste management initiatives and partnerships across sectors, as \[text removed for publication\] from AIKMM explains: 

 “The research highlighted the need for decentralised technologies... \(but\) while we were familiar with them, we had never put them into practice. The many dialogues with the project team helped us move in this direction. Now we are involved in implementing successful initiatives on decentralised composting with informal waste workers, municipal bodies and resident welfare associations. We have seven such projects in Bihar, one in Delhi and one in Gurgaon and plan to expand.” \[ **S6**\] 

 The research also provided the stimulus for Delhi’s Lok Adhikar \(a union for informal wastepickers\) to sign a formal contract with a private company for the segregation of waste in Rohini Zone \(an area of Delhi with a population of around 860,000\). This move is a practical example of principle 4, demonstrating how informal and formal private sectors can form new synergies which support informal livelihoods. Lok Adhikar was convinced to take this step by the project’s research into alternative practices in Pune and Ahmedabad. Lok Adhikar has subsequently been offered a contract for the Civil Lines Zone \(population 360,000\). These contracts not only provide security of livelihood for informal waste pickers, but also reduce pollution. \[text removed for publication\] of Lok Adhikar, states: 

 “As a result of our interactions and the research findings of the project, we got many new insights on our work. These discussions helped us to understand why it is important for us to actively engage with the formal system of waste management… With this view we signed a formal contract with a waste management company. We are also more mindful of the fact that segregation and recycling is not only a beneficial activity for these \[informal waste\] workers but is also an important environmental intervention for the entire city. We also got a renewed and comprehensive understanding of the MSW Rules 2016. We no longer view it from only a critical perspective, but see it as a site of opportunity... We have conducted workshops for our workers... \[they\] are now part of the advocacy efforts for the implementation of those provisions that directly benefit them” \[ **S7**\]

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Bioenergy has become the largest renewable energy technology in the UK, contributing >31% renewable electricity, >83% renewable heat and 5% total transport energy. The UK Government has strong ambitions to increase bioenergy as part of its industrial strategy and climate change commitments. 

 University of Manchester \(UoM\) research has provided science underpinning the UK’s bioenergy strategy, which provides the foundations for growing a sustainable bioenergy sector. Working in partnership with industry, NGOs and Government, UoM research has promoted a greater role for bioenergy, use of UK biomass resources, and best use for biomass. Manchester’s science directly influenced the refocusing of the UK’s Renewable Heat Incentive \(RHI\) in 2015 to prioritise heat bioenergy generated from UK waste materials that has, to date, resulted in an 84% increase in UK bioheat generation from these fuels. Manchester research also helped secure an additional GBP110,000,000 from HM Treasury to extend the RHI scheme and develop future renewable heat support schemes. 
","
##  2. Underpinning Research 

 The bioenergy research themes described here were pioneered at UoM through the Supergen Bioenergy Hub \(led by Thornley at UoM between 2012‒18, and at Aston University from September 2018 onwards\): the UK’s bioenergy research programme and network that brings together academia, industry, government and societal stakeholders to develop sustainable bioenergy systems. UoM research has influenced the UK’s Bioenergy Strategy through: i\) promoting a greater role for bioenergy, ii\) promoting UK biomass resources, and iii\) promoting the best uses for biomass. 

###  Identifying the UK’s bioenergy opportunities 

 Between 2012 and 2014, Welfle developed the ‘Biomass Resource Model’ \(BRM\), a tool that allows evaluation of the availability of biomass resources through analysing land systems, industries and supply chains within a chosen geography. Previous models of this type overwhelmingly focused on assessing specific biomass supply chains \( *e.g.* energy crops\), specific technologies \( *e.g*. gasification systems\) or specific locations \( *e.g*. a single field or region\). The BRM is novel in allowing a full assessment of all land\-sourced biomass resources and all bioenergy technology options, with the flexibility to potentially analyse any chosen geography. 

 The BRM provided the foundation for a series of papers that both analysed the biomass resource dynamics in key countries from which the UK is/could import biomass for energy **\[1\]**; and identified indigenous biomass resource opportunities the UK could pursue to reduce reliance on imported biomass **\[2\]**. Key outputs from this research included: 

-  **Competition for biomass is only likely to intensify for countries like the UK**, which are increasingly reliant on imported biomass for energy. Further constraint may also emerge if key biomass exporting countries, such as Brazil, were to increase use of biomass for energy rather than export, affecting global biomass trade markets **\[1\]**. 

-  **Promoting UK biomass resources**: There are significant indigenous biomass opportunities in the UK including from agriculture, forestry and industry residue resources, waste resources, and through promoting production of energy crops. UK indigenous biomass resources could service up to 44% of UK energy demand by 2050, reducing reliance on imports **\[2\]**. 

-  **Promoting the best uses for biomass**: Selected UK biomass resources should be prioritised to produce high\-value products such as transport fuels. The remaining suitable resources should be dedicated to generating heat energy **\[2\]**. 

###  Increasing the Greenhouse Gas \(GHG\) performance of bioenergy 

 Since 2012, UoM have developed pioneering research and methods applying life cycle assessment \(LCA\) analyses to evaluate the GHG performance and sustainability of bioenergy systems. This is underpinned by the research of Thornley *et al.* **\[3\]**, who conceptualised how to best use LCA to validate bioenergy projects that deliver GHG reductions compared to fossil fuel energy systems. Through assessing the GHG performances of each life cycle step within a given bioenergy system, strategic choices can be made about the inclusion of processes inherent to bioenergy technologies and their supply chains. 

 Röder *et al.* **\[4\]** analysed the GHG performances of the UK’s current strategy of large\-scale bio\-power generation from wood pellets imported from North America. They found this practice could deliver energy with emission performances of between 80% less GHGs, to 70% more GHGs than fossil fuels. By analysing each step in the process life cycles, they identified specific practices that should be avoided to ensure less GHG generation compared to fossil fuel systems. 

###  UoM bioenergy research applied for the UK Government 

 Welfle completed a knowledge exchange secondment from UoM to the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change \(DECC\) in 2014, contributing to DECC’s highly influential ‘Bioenergy Emissions and Counterfactual’ \(BEaC\) research that evaluated the GHG performance of bio\-power options for the UK **\[A\]**. Welfle evaluated further options for the UK increasing bio\-heat generation by applying UoM’s BRM analysis tool to identify suitable UK biomass resource opportunities, and UoM’s bioenergy GHG LCA approach to evaluate the GHG performance of each. The resulting research paper **\[5\]** and technical report for DECC **\[6\]** presented key recommendations: 

-  The vast majority of the 2,000 UK bioheat scenarios analysed *“demonstrate significant potential GHG savings compared to conventional fossil fuel generation”* achieving GHG performances far below the UK’s benchmark for sustainable generation \(34.8 gCO<sub>2</sub>e MJ<sup>−1</sup>\) **\[5\]**. 

-  Food and agricultural wastes and residues that have no other uses should be prioritised for bioenergy. These represent examples of ‘bioenergy opportunities’ for generating low/net\-zero carbon energy, contributing to the decarbonisation of the UK energy sector and wider GHG emissions inventories, as counterfactual waste management emissions are prevented **\[5\]**.

","
##  4. Details of the impact 

 UoM researchers have worked closely with Government departments and advisory organisations providing science and recommendations to promote i\) a greater role for bioenergy, ii\) greater utilisation of UK waste and residue resources, and iii\) bio\-heat as a best use for UK biomass. The following examples demonstrate areas where UoM research has influenced UK bioenergy strategy and policy: 

###  Influencing UK bioenergy strategy 

 UoM researchers contributed to, and are cited by, over 20 reports advising the UK Government on the development of the UK bioenergy strategy. A prominent example includes the Committee on Climate Change’s \(CCC\) ‘Biomass in a Low\-Carbon Economy’ Report **\[B\]** – developed to advise the Government of the potential role of bioenergy in decarbonising the UK economy. CCC’s Head of Bioenergy corroborates **\[C\]** that UoM research was integral to develop the CCC’s recommendations for Government: 

-  “… *Thornley had a key role in developing the Report through leading the Expert Advisory Group”* **\[C\]**. 

-  The Report’s scientific framework was developed based on a UK\-wide ‘call for evidence’ consultation process \- *“University of Manchester research focusing on biomass resource availability and GHG performances of bioenergy authored by* \[UoM researchers\] *was widely cited and referenced in key responses to this consultation, included within the consultation responses from the National Farmers Union, Ricardo Energy & Environment Consultants, UK Renewable Energy Association...”* **\[C\]**. 

-  UoM research **\[2, 3, 5\]** is cited throughout the CCC’s Final Report **\[B\]** and the Bioenergy Call for Evidence Report **\[D\]**. 

 The CCC Report’s recommendations directly influenced UK Government Bioenergy Strategy as evidenced in the Government’s ‘Clean Growth – Transforming Heating’ Report **\[E\]**. CCC recommendations on the potential scale of bioenergy that may be generated from UK biomass resources are cited – these draw directly on UoM research. Two examples include: 

-  *“*\[CCC\] *indicates that sustainable supply could meet 5\-15% of the UK’s primary energy demand”* almost directly quotes the findings from **\[2\]**, *“residues from agriculture, forestry and industry* \[…\] *potentially providing up to 6.5% of primary energy demand by 2050. Waste resources are found to potentially provide up to 15.4%”.* 

-  *“It is necessary to prioritise biomass where it has the greatest decarbonisation impact”* directly draws on the findings from **\[5\]** *“*\[policy focus\] *should move away from the focus of bioenergy to ‘maximise renewable generation’ rather than to simply ‘reduce GHG emissions’”*. 

 UK Research Councils acknowledged this change in UK Bioenergy Strategy, as demonstrated through the GBP8,000,000 EPSRC 2019 ‘Decarbonising Heating and Cooling’ funding call **\[F\]**, which directly cites the Government’s ‘Transforming Heating‘ Report **\[E\]**. 

###  Influencing UK bioheat Renewable Heat Incentive \(RHI\) policy 

 During 2014 Welfle was seconded to UK DECC, where he applied UoM research to analyse the GHG performance of UK heat bioenergy scenarios using UK resources. BEIS’ Head of Bioenergy & Land Use Science confirms that this, *“*… *project was carried out working closely with DECC’s Renewable Heat Incentive \(RHI\) Policy Team, where the research fed directly into their work in refocusing the RHI scheme particularly around anaerobic digestion”* **\[G\]**. 

 Prior to its refocusing in 2015, the RHI scheme supported heat from biogas produced using any form of biomass as fuel. The UK Government decided to review this to *“maximise the benefits of payments to contribute to carbon budgets”*, proposing to *“reduce or eliminate support for new installations relying on crops as their primary feedstock”* **\[H\]**. 

 Recommendations from Welfle’s research influenced the RHI Policy Criteria, notably regarding the greater incentivisation of food and agricultural wastes \- based on their potential for greater decarbonisation of the UK’s waste and agriculture GHG inventories: 

-  Biogas schemes eligible for unlimited support include those fuelled by *“…feedstocks that are currently exempt from demonstrating sustainability criteria such as manure, slurry and food waste”* **\[H\]**. This links directly to UoM recommendations **\[5, 6\]**: *“…agricultural wastes currently managed utilising GHG intensive processes should be prioritised for bioenergy pathways”* and *“food wastes currently sent to landfill should also be prioritised for bioenergy pathways”.* 

-  The refocused RHI prioritises these biogas schemes, as *“…these tend to provide more cost effective carbon abatement, with significant additional emissions savings in the waste and agriculture sectors”* **\[H\]**. This links directly to UoM recommendations **\[5, 6\]**: *“Utilisation of these wastes* via *‘anaerobic digestion’ would enable the mitigation of potentially high GHG emissions...”* and *“...emissions savings that have been prevented through the mitigation of a high impact activity within the counterfactual will likely be attributed to the emission inventories of sectors other than the energy sector”.* 

 BEIS corroborates that *“the research completed during the secondment contributed to decisions that led to the promotion of generating biogas from waste materials within the RHI scheme”* **\[G\]**. Since reformation of the RHI policy the latest UK Energy Statistics \(2019\) confirm a **85% increase in UK heat generation from resources such as food and agricultural wastes** – a rise from **11.5 GWh in 2015** \(22.3% total UK renewable heat\) to **21.1 GWh in 2018** \(31.7% of total\). 

###  Influencing the extension of funding for UK bioheat 

 Welfle was the academic member of the Heat Working Group \(HWG\) that developed the Renewable Energy Association’s \(R\-E\-A, a not\-for\-profit trade association\) 2019 Bioenergy Strategy Reports **\[I\]**. Drawing on Welfle’s experience working with DECC on the RHI scheme, and through highlighting UoM research **\[2, 5\]**, the leading recommendation for Government from the HWG was to act urgently to ensure continued support for UK renewable heat. Funding for the RHI had been due to end March 2021, and so *“a replacement scheme is required to secure a market for renewable heat technologies including biomass boilers, anaerobic digestion and biofuels”* **\[I\]**. 

 This recommendation was included in the R\-E\-A’s written evidence submitted to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee. It was subsequently cited in the Committee’s ‘Report of Session 2017\-2019’: *“the Government must ensure that it avoids a repeat of the disruption caused by the closure of the feed\-in tariff, and announces its plans for the successor scheme to the Renewable Heat Incentive no later than the Spring Statement 2020”* **\[J\]**. UK Government responded confirming that it is *“…committed to phasing out the installation of high carbon fossil fuel heating systems in off gas grid properties and will be consulting on options in early 2020”* **\[J\]**. In the 2020 Budget, HM Treasury committed **GBP10,000,000** to *“…extend the Domestic RHI in Great Britain until 31 March 2022”* and an additional **GBP100,000,000** for *“…introducing a new grant scheme from April 2022 to help households and small businesses invest in heat pumps and biomass boilers”* **\[K\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2016, Springer Nature, one of the world’s foremost academic publishing companies, has used a software solution developed through **Motta**, **Osborne** and **Salatino’s** research on scholarly knowledge mining to significantly improve the efficiency and quality of its editorial processes. 

 Using the researchers’ Smart Topic Miner \(STM\) software to automate the process of annotating conference proceedings for its Computer Science book series, Springer Nature has reduced its associated editorial costs by 75%. STM has also enabled its editorial assistants’ professional development and improved the quality of its processes, leading directly to an additional 12 million downloads of its approximately 3,200 STM\-edited Computer Science books. This corresponds to a 53% positive growth differential with respect to the average growth trend for non\-STM\-edited Computer Science books. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Led by **Motta**, The Open University’s Scholarly Knowledge Modelling, Mining and Sense\-Making research group \(SKM³\) develops innovative techniques and tools to generate value from scholarly data. Its technologies provide academic publishing companies and other organizations with insights on the research dynamic in a particular scientific field or venue, geographical area, or organization. They also facilitate the effective curation of scholarly resources. Since 2011, the group has attracted funding for about GBP750,000, including direct sponsorships from the two leading international academic publishing companies, Elsevier and Springer Nature. 

 A significant output of SKM³’s research programme is the *Klink* algorithm **\[O1, O2\]**. Developed by **Motta** and **Osborne**, this ontology learning technique applies an innovative amalgamation of statistics with heuristic and knowledge\-based reasoning, to analyse extensive collections of research publications and automatically generate a comprehensive and granular taxonomy of the research areas in the scientific field relevant to the given corpus, e.g., Computer Science. Klink is distinct in its approach to automatic taxonomy generation, as it considers the conditional probability of the candidate topics and their similarity in a vector space, as well as their diachronic relationships. It is also the first method in the scholarly domain to combine multiple sources of evidence, including both large\-scale repositories of publication metadata from sources such as Scopus and Microsoft Academic Graph, as well as general\-purpose knowledge sources available online, such as DBpedia. As demonstrated rigorously, this hybrid approach is key to optimizing the quality of the output **\[O1, O2\]**. 

 **Motta**, **Osborne** and **Salatino** have used the Klink algorithm to generate the *Computer Science Ontology* \(CSO\) **\[O3\]**. This large\-scale ontology defines the most complete model of Computer Science research areas currently available, covering well over 14,000 topics in Computer Science. In particular, CSO’s classification is an order of magnitude bigger than the most widely used alternative, the Association for Computing Machinery’s \(ACM\) Computing Classification System. Moreover, in contrast with ACM’s classification, which was produced manually over many years, the Klink\-generated taxonomy requires no human intervention. Hence, it is possible to automatically update the taxonomy regularly, ensuring an accurate reflection of the most recent trends in research. Formal evaluations of CSO have shown a high degree of accuracy **\[O1, O2\]** and the availability of such a comprehensive and fine\-grained characterization of the space of research areas has allowed the SKM<sup>3</sup> team to develop a number of innovative techniques, able to capture accurately detailed elements of the research dynamic in the Computer Science field **\[O3\]**. 

 To take full advantage of the granularity and accuracy provided by CSO in the context of automatic classification of research papers, **Motta**, **Osborne**, and **Salatino** developed the *CSO Classifier* **\[O4\]**. This new unsupervised approach takes the metadata associated with a research paper, such as its title, abstract, and keywords, as an input, and outputs the relevant research topics drawn from CSO. When evaluated against a gold\-standard sample of manually annotated articles, the researchers found that the CSO classifier demonstrated a significant improvement in annotation accuracy in comparison with alternative methods **\[O4\]**. 

 The Open University researchers also employed CSO as the critical domain model underpinning the Smart Topic Miner \(STM\), a solution they specifically developed for the global academic publishing company, Springer Nature **\[O5\]**. This software uses the CSO Classifier \(https://pypi.org/project/cso\-classifier/\) to annotate individual papers in Computer Science conference proceedings automatically. It then enhances an intelligent set\-covering algorithm, which makes use of the topology provided by CSO, with a number of domain heuristics, to determine the best set of topics describing the overall scientific contribution of each volume. STM also provides a highly interactive interface, which allows users to investigate its rationale for proposing classifications. STM’s output forms part of the publication metadata, which the publisher then uses for classifying proceedings in digital and physical libraries. Crucially, the goal of STM is not only to improve the efficiency of the metadata generation process but also metadata quality, to facilitate the discoverability of the Springer Nature’s annotated conference proceeding volumes, both on their online portal, SpringerLink, as well as other digital libraries and third\-party sites.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Generating scholarly metadata is a complex task in the academic editorial workflow. The proceedings of a particular conference may easily contain hundreds of contributions, where each of these can be relevant to several areas of research at varying levels of granularity. As a result, the number of topics covered by the proceedings can be very high, which means selecting a subset of topics to best describe the entire set of contributions, when compiled in book volume, is very challenging. Hence, this complex and time\-consuming task has traditionally been tackled by highly experienced Senior Editors at Springer Nature. However, their limited numbers have resulted in bottlenecks, delays and a costly editorial process. In addition, there were also significant quality issues, as it was impossible for these editors both to have the required in\-depth knowledge to classify every contribution accurately, as well as being able to manage the complexity of the task of selecting topics at proceedings level, without intelligent computational support. 

 In October 2014, Springer Nature asked **Motta**, **Osborne** and **Salatino** to help them find an efficient and robust solution to this problem, based on the researchers’ work on Klink **\[O1, O2\]** and the Computer Science Ontology \(CSO\) **\[O3\]**. Their solution, the Smart Topic Miner \(STM\), has been in routine use at Springer Nature since 2016 and has i\) resulted in an overall 75% cost reduction for this annotation task, ii\) enabled the professional development of editorial assistants, and iii\) dramatically improved the overall quality of the process, as evidenced by the additional 12M downloads recorded for the \~3200 Computer Science proceedings annotated by STM. Hence, STM has generated a significant impact on *Productivity* and *Enhanced Performance*, in terms of *efficiency*, *cost reduction*, and *quality*, and also on the *Practitioners* themselves, in terms of *professional development*. The beneficiaries include *Springer Nature*, who is benefitting from improved productivity, as well as the individual *members of the Editorial Assistants Team*, whose professional development has been supported by the deployment of STM. 

 **Impact on Productivity: Improving efficiency and reducing costs** 

 Computer Science Conference Proceedings constitute about 70% of all books Springer Nature publishes in Computer Science, which is their top\-ranked field overall in terms of book downloads, and around 8% of its entire book output. While Springer Nature would not provide exact figures, we understand that the market value of this sector \(Computer Science Proceedings\) is in the order of millions of Euros. Using the researchers’ Smart Topic Miner \(STM\) software to automate the process of annotating these conference proceedings, the academic publishing company has reduced its related costs by 75% **\[C1\]**. This dramatic cost reduction is the result of two benefits brought by STM. First, the software has halved the time required to annotate individual proceedings, compared to human annotation. Second, STM has made it possible for relatively junior Editorial Assistants, rather than the members of the Computer Science Editorial Team, to undertake the task. As the ratio of assistants to Senior Editors is five to one, STM has not only reduced costs but also effectively eliminated the delays and bottlenecks which arose from relying on a smaller senior team. 

 **Impact on Productivity: Improving quality** 

 STM has also significantly improved the quality of the metadata generation process for all Computer Science Proceedings at Springer Nature, including LNCS, LNAI, IFIP\-AICT and others, for a total of about 800 volumes per year. As a result, both individual users and search engines can now more effectively identify the resources they need on the company’s online portal, SpringerLink. In particular, there have been around 12 million more downloads in the past 4 years for STM\-annotated Computer Science volumes, in comparison to those Computer Science volumes that do not make use of STM **\[C1\]**. More precisely, while downloads of Computer Science books at Springer Nature have been growing steadily across the board for a number of years, since 2016 the rate of growth for Computer Science Proceedings has accelerated dramatically, in comparison to other Computer Science volumes, a trend that can only be explained with the improved metadata quality brought about by the introduction of STM in the editorial process. Specifically, the growth differential between Computer Science Proceedings and other Computer Science books published by Springer Nature is 53%. The key reason here is that, in contrast with human editors, STM relies on a highly accurate classification of individual papers, provided by the CSO Classifier **\[O4\]**. Building on this initial set of metadata, it then exploits CSO’s topology **\[O3\]** and additional information, such as the popularity of different topics in the proceedings, to apply a heuristic set covering method that identifies those topics which best describe the set of conference proceedings compiled in book volume form. Crucially, STM guarantees that quality is scalable by avoiding historical classification errors resulting from different editors performing such a complex task manually. Writing in October 2020, the former Editorial Director, LNCS and Computer Science Proceedings at Springer Nature \(currently, Vice\-President Journals, Russia\), highlighted the impact of STM on the company’s productivity and quality in the following terms: “ *In conclusion, I can state without hesitation that our collaboration with the team at The Open University has been extremely successful, allowing us to deploy a state\-of\-the\-art AI solution within our editorial processes, which has addressed a key business need. I am very much looking forward to continuing our collaboration*”. 

 **Enhancing Editorial Assistants’ professional development** 

 STM has had a significant impact on the professional development of Springer Nature’s team of 18 Editorial Assistants by empowering them to undertake a critical task that, until the introduction of this technology, was reserved to Senior Editors. This change has enabled these relatively junior professionals to become directly involved with the more scholarly aspects of the editorial production process, and more familiar with the large space of Computer Science topics. In the aforementioned letter, the former Editorial Director also describes how the introduction of STM has facilitated a “ *mental shift*” in Editorial Assistants, allowing them to gain the confidence necessary to tackle more complex tasks **\[C1\]**. 

 In addition, in a July 2020 letter to **Motta**, an Editorial Assistant at Springer Nature points out that, before STM was adopted, “ *the role of editorial assistants in the Computer Science Department primarily focused on performing a number of administrative and clerical tasks, such as managing the flow of manuscripts, acting as point of contact across different departments, and supporting editors and authors with their queries*” **\[C2\]**. Thanks to the introduction of STM in the editorial workflow, the letter goes on to explain, Editorial Assistants can now not only undertake more scholarly tasks but “ *they have also gained a much better understanding both of the editorial processes regarding content classification and the computer science domain*” **\[C2\]**. 

 This learning also means that several new opportunities within Springer Nature are now open to Editorial Assistants, such as progressing into the role of Associate Editor or other positions that require experience in content classification. Springer Nature’s senior leaders have welcomed these beneficial side\-effects, in particular because the professional development of Editorial Assistants is a key plank of their internal Human Resources strategy **\[C1, C3\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Open Library of Humanities \(OLH\) has transformed the space of scholarly communications. Working within a context in which governments and funders have committed to the principle that outputs of publicly funded research should be widely and freely accessible as soon as possible, Edwards and Eve theorised and then implemented a novel but economically viable model for scholarly communication which is operational and financially supported by 300 libraries worldwide. Through this, the OLH has changed the economic and behavioural patterns of libraries, publishers, journal editors, and authors and contributed significantly to policy debates about the future of open access. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 *This research began before Eve arrived at Birkbeck \(1 May 2015\) with the publication of his influential Cambridge University Press book, Open Access and the Humanities: Contexts, Controversies and the Future \(2014\). The monograph established Eve at the forefront of research into scholarly literature in the humanities, a position he has maintained through his continuing research on open access since joining Birkbeck in 2015.* 

 The study of publishing has long been part of the discipline of English literature and Edwards’s and Eve’s work extends it to consider the publication of scholarly literature, work Edwards began when she joined Birkbeck as a lecturer in 2013 and continued in collaboration with Eve when he joined the College in 2015. 

 Articles by Edwards in *Insights* \(2014\)<sup>1</sup> and Eve in *Online Information Review* \(2015\)<sup>2</sup> theorised the challenges facing open access \(OA\) in the humanities, their potential solutions, and the opportunities presented should they be overcome. They identified Article Processing Charges \(APCs\) as a particular barrier for the large\-scale adoption of open access in the humanities. APCs are a prominent model for open access with a fee paid directly by the author or on their behalf by a funding body or institution to convert each article to open access. While a common model, it is generally recognised as financially prohibitive, especially in the humanities. Edwards and Eve instead proposed an alternative in the form of library consortia to pool resources enabling a sustainable model for whole journals to become open access. Edwards advocated for being proactive rather than waiting for policy to catch up, with the sharing of research ultimately beneficial to the creation of a more positive research culture. 

 These foundations were embedded in the successful launch of the Open Library of Humanities \(OLH\) as a platform in September 2015. As the OLH has evolved, subsequent research has been informed by and then informed the project and platform. Labour considerations for open\-access publishing that form the grounding for OLH’s ongoing business model and budgetary planning, for example, are explored by Eve in a 2017 article for *The Journal of Scholarly Publishing*<sup>3</sup>. 

 Eve’s research also explored the challenges facing open\-access monograph publication, particularly the economics of scaling, in *Online Information Review*<sup>2</sup> and in a 2017 article in *Insights*<sup>4</sup>. Issues of value, peer\-review, and evaluation are further explored in a 2017 article for *Triple C*, and in peer\-reviewed book chapters, including for Oxford University Press \(2018\). These are important for an understanding of the ways in which OLH filters material and how evolving debates around peer review \(e.g. post\-publication review, open review\) apply to humanities disciplines. 

 A 2020 article by Eve, Vega and Edwards in *Liber*<sup>5</sup> draws up a balance sheet of the OLH’s first five years, the challenges faced and lessons learned. Each of these publications contributes to the OLH’s evolving praxis, building a rigorous underpinning theoretical model of economics, labour, peer\-review, evaluation, and disciplinary communities for evolving open publication in the humanities. 

 Eve is the recipient of several honours and awards for this research.  He was one of five shortlisted for higher education’s most inspiring leader in the *Guardian*’s University Awards 2017; in May 2018 he was awarded the KU Leuven Medal of Honour in the Humanities and Social Sciences for his research work on open access; and he received a 2019 Philip Leverhulme Prize in the category of Languages and Literatures. 

  

 The OLH has won the Open Publishing Award in the category of Open Publishing Models by the Coko Foundation in 2019, who described it as ‘a force of nature’; Small Digital Publisher of the Year at the Association of Publishers \(AOP\) Digital Publishing Awards in 2020; and was highly commended at the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers awards in 2020.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research being made freely available to all through open access has huge potential benefits for researchers, educational institutions, business, and society at large. Open access is the most significant global change for academic publishing in a generation. It has grown exponentially: the *Directory of Open Access Journals* listed 300 titles in 2003 but 15,000 in 2020<sup>1</sup>. Open access addresses key issues such as the spiralling cost of subscribing to academic journals and global inequalities in access to resources<sup>2</sup>. It has been deemed crucial by organisations as diverse as the US Federal Government, UNESCO, and The Wellcome Trust. UK funding body UKRI now stipulates that outputs from their funded research must be open access, supporting the principle of publicly funded research being publicly available. The cost to convert to open access using dominant economic models, however, remains exorbitant \(particularly using APCs\) and problematic, with publicly funded research sold back to the public \(often via a for\-profit entity\) with the intermediary bodies generating significant \(and often growing\) profit margins. 

 It is within this context that Edwards and Eve founded, and continue to lead \(as co CEOs\), the Open Library of Humanities which pioneered an alternative approach for open access, offering a value\-driven, collectivist business model that is equitable for both authors and readers. 

 The OLH publishes world\-leading, rigorous and peer\-reviewed scholarship across the humanities disciplines in 28 fully open access journals, with no article processing charges. Instead, it is a financially self\-sustaining model with 300 libraries worldwide pooling their resources to convert \(‘flip’\) journals wholesale to open access, which are then hosted on the OLH platform.<sup>3</sup> More research is consequently openly available worldwide with commensurate benefits to the public and developing economies. Moreover, partner institutions have a say in the decisions of the OLH. As more sign\-up, the cost per institution comes down. Its practical success and the research underpinning it have changed the behaviour of governments, funders, journal editors, business and others worldwide. It has become ‘the standard international reference point for such models’, leading ‘to many publishers transitioning to OA with many more yet to come. It is looked to as the example of how things could be different’<sup>4</sup>. 

 The British Library, for instance, recognising the onerous nature of other models, ‘believes that a lack of funding should not be an obstacle for scholars who wish to make their research as openly available as possible. It is for this reason that we are proud to join the Open Library of Humanities \(OLH\) as an institutional member.’<sup>5a</sup><sup>,</sup> University Libraries joined OLH because it is academic\-led and an exemplary approach to sustainable open\-access publishing<sup>5b</sup>. The transformative nature of the OLH is such that several institutions choose to financially support it at more than double the required rate<sup>5c</sup>. Although the OLH was launched and primarily focused on the Anglophone world, others have been inspired by its example and have taken it upon themselves to become advocates for its expansion. OLH\-DE, launched in March 2018 and funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, actively promotes the OLH in Germany, aiming to attract German libraries as participating institutions, and German\-language journals to ‘flip’ to open access using the OLH platform<sup>5d</sup>. 

 The OLH has positively impacted library expenditure worldwide, one example was the resignation of the editorial board of the Elsevier journal *Lingua* in 2015 to establish a new open access journal, *Glossa*, hosted and underpinned by the OLH. The University of California Library System subsequently made a ‘deliberate decision’ to cancel their subscription to *Lingua*<sup>6a</sup>. 

 In addition to its benefits to libraries, a significant aspect of the OLH is that it provides a sustainable economic model for journals and publishers that agree with open access but have hitherto been reliant on subscriptions and article processing charges to ensure a sufficient income. As examples, Liverpool University Press has converted *Quaker Studies* and *Francospheres* to full open access<sup>7a</sup> and the University of Wales Press has done similarly for the *International Journal of Welsh Writing* in English<sup>7b</sup>. Open access helps these value\-driven publishers fulfil a greater purpose. Open access helps fulfil this objective by enabling their publications to be available to the broader public as well as academics. The economics of other models, however, had proved prohibitive. The OLH model, on the other hand, was not only invaluable in achieving open access to this title, but also ensured the viability of the journal in an important subject in UWP’s mission. Prior to working with the OLH, the journal’s very existence was in doubt, given the relatively modest market and consequent need for funding to bring it to publication as a subscription model.<sup>7b</sup>. 

 Six Learned Societies – the European Architectural History Network, the British Association of Film, Television and Screen Studies, the British Association for Contemporary Literary Studies, the Association for Laboratory Phonology, The Marvell Society, and the ASIANetwork \(a consortium of over 170 North American colleges\) – have converted all their publications to open access through the OLH. As an editor noted, they wanted to convert the journal to open access. Article processing charges, however, were exclusionary and they wanted a model that was free both to readers and to authors. They encountered Eve’s research and decided to host the journal on the OLH from September 2015. From then until December 2019, they had 16,553 article downloads. In just 2019, they had 28,317 unique article views \(of the on\-page versions of articles\). This represents a substantial escalation in reach and helps the society to fulfil its mission.<sup>8</sup>. 

 Aside from its direct beneficiaries, the OLH has positively impacted businesses including Érudit, a Canadian consortium which provides access to more than 150 journals, books and other research outputs, 97% of which is open access. As of May 2017, it recorded 23 million page views annually, with 70% of users based outside Canada. In 2016, it began an important shift in its business model to convert commercial agreements with Canadian libraries to an open access model based on partnerships and the OLH was one of the core sources that Érudit used.<sup>9a</sup>. Another business that has benefited from the OLH is the major open access publisher PLOS, which runs the world’s largest journal, *PLOS One*, and has net assets worth $10.7 million \(i.e. USD10,700,000\) and total revenues in 2018 of $31.7 million \(or USD31,700,000\). PLOS has traditionally relied on article processing charges as its primary revenue strategy but recognises their exclusionary characteristics and their limitations regarding the distribution of funds. Accordingly, PLOS have adopted new business models intended to make open access publishing more equitable by removing barriers to publishing. PLOS felt confident that such drastic changes could \(and had to\) be made given the success of other transformative initiatives like Open Library of the Humanities, which demonstrates their viability financially and their alignment with the mission\-driven academic libraries.<sup>9b</sup>. 

 The OLH and particularly Eve have deeply influenced and altered the policies that will be implemented by cOAlition S from 2021 onwards, a body of 25 research funders, headed by the European Commission and including UKRI, the World Health Organisation, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Their ‘Plan S’ requires research to be made publicly available upon publication, without delay, with no embargo period. Eve’s research ‘led to several revisions to the Plan S guidelines, emphasizing the need for diverse business models and that APCs \(article processing charges\) should not be the sole means of achieving Open Access.’ Eve’s research has been particularly influential in its advocacy of diamond open access, referring to models in which neither readers nor authors are charged to read and publish. cOAlition S commissioned a study into these models, based on Eve’s research, and are using this to inform yheir policies. This has been instrumental in the commitment of various national research agencies – including the Dutch NWO and the Austrian FWF, and charitable foundations such as the Wellcome Trust – to support diamond platforms, such as the OLH.<sup>6c</sup> This has affected thousands of funded researchers, worldwide.<sup>10</sup>. 

 A particularly thorny issue has been the economics of converting monographs to open access \(OA\). Eve’s research on this has led directly to Research England announcing its intention to mandate OA books in the REF after next.<sup>4</sup>. It also led to the £3m COPIM project to develop the necessary infrastructure for transitioning monographs to OA, and, the mass transition of presses that we are seeing worldwide is potentially the most significant direct impact of Eve’s research. For example, Eve’s work in early 2020 as part of the COPIM project led to the transition of the Central European University Press to an open\-access model; a complete conversion with a new model for OA books – “Opening the Future” – that will now spread to other presses worldwide.<sup>4</sup>

###  1. Summary of the impact 

###  University of Leicester research led by Professor Robinson since 2003 has improved stroke patient outcomes, including survival, neurological and functional recovery, and the safety of thrombolytic therapy. This research has influenced national and international medical guidelines, and informed the treatment of >100,000 acute stroke patients per annum in the UK alone since 2013. Survivor independence from haemorrhagic stroke improved by 13 percent. Changing treatment to low\-dose thrombolysis could prevent approximately 20,000 stroke\-related deaths worldwide. These findings have informed UK and US guidance for individualised treatment, which improves long\-term functional outcomes after stroke. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

###  Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the UK. In the UK, there are over 1.2 million stroke survivors and two thirds live with stroke\-related disability. This reduces quality\-of\-life for patients and family carers, and costs the UK economy £26 billion annually. Hypertension in acute stroke is common but globally under\-researched, requiring new stroke treatment protocols to reduce death and prevent neurological deterioration and disability. 

###  Professor Robinson’s stroke research \[R1 – R6\] since 2000 has informed stroke management guidelines in the UK, Europe, and the USA, and treatment for >100,000 acute stroke patients per annum in the UK alone. Based within the University of Leicester’s Cerebral Haemodynamics in Ageing and Stroke Medicine Research Group since 1993, Robinson has acted as Chief Investigator or National Co\-ordinating Investigator of large, international randomised clinical trials since 2003 \[G1–G6\]. 

###  Robinson’s research on cerebral autoregulation and potential dangers to neurological health from sudden reductions in blood pressure informed the COSSACS trial and subsequent individual patient data meta\-analysis that proved that pre\-existing antihypertensive therapy following acute ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke should be discontinued until patients are stable and able to swallow safely \[R1\-R2, G1\]. This contributed to fewer deaths and savings for the NHS by removing costs for unnecessary medication. 

###  Intracerebral haemorrhage—bleeding within the brain tissue—is the most devastating form of stroke, with significant mortality and long\-term neurological disability and dependency. As Co\-I of the Intensive blood pressure reduction in acute intracerebral haemorrhage \(2008\-2013\) study \[G2\], Robinson compared guideline\-versus\-intensive blood pressure lowering within six hours of onset in spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage \(ICH\). Intensive blood pressure lowering was found to be safe, and can be effective for improving functional outcome \[R3\]. 

###  Intravenous thrombolysis is the only licensed therapy for acute ischaemic stroke, but increases the risk of symptomatic ICH \(sICH\) by two to eight per cent; approximately half are fatal. As CI \(UK\) \[G4\-G5\] and Co\-I \(International\) \[G3, G6\] of the ENCHANTED trials \(2012\-2019\), Robinson compared guideline\-versus\-intensive blood pressure lowering in alteplase\-treated acute ischaemic stroke with respect to superiority for efficacy \(modified Rankin scale \(mRS\) score shift\) and safety \(sICH\). Intensive blood pressure lowering was safe and associated with a significant reduction in intracranial bleeding and serious clinician\-reported bleeding but did not affect functional outcome at 90 days \[R4\]. Robinson also compared standard\- versus low\-dose alteplase for non\-inferiority with respect to efficacy \(dichotmised mRS: independent 0 to 1 vs. death/ dependency 2 to 6\) and superiority with respect to sICH \(2012 – 2016\) \[G3\-G6\]. The trial reported a lower risk of ICH and early mortality with the lower dose, without conclusively demonstrating that the doses were of equivalent efficacy. However, UK guideline interpretations indicate that the patient or physician may wish to forgo potential disability benefit from standard dose in order to reduce the early risk of ICH through use of the lower dose \[R5\]. 

###  As Co\-I of HeadPoST \(2015\-2017\) \[G7\] \(>11,000 patients in nine countries\), Robinson compared the efficacy of head positions on stroke outcome in the first 24 hours following acute ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. Lying flat improves cerebral blood flow, but potentially increases intracranial pressure and pneumonia rates. Sitting up increases blood return to the heart but reduces cerebral blood flow. The findings of the HeadPoST trial demonstrated no significant recovery benefit from head positioning, eliminating the need for expensive specialist beds for acute stroke management, with worldwide healthcare implications \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Someone has a new or recurrent stroke every five minutes in the UK; >100,000 strokes per annum. Since 2016, outputs from Robinson’s research with the completed COSSACS, ENCHANTED, HeadPoST and INTERACT2 trials **\[R1, R3\-R6\]** informed stroke patient management worldwide following citations in UK, European and United States clinical guidelines **\[E1–E6\]**. Overall, these results improve outcome and survival for approximately 50,000 stroke patients per annum in the UK on pre\-existing antihypertensive therapy, 15,000 acute haemorrhagic stroke patients, and 20,000 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. 

 **New acute stroke blood pressure guidelines improve stroke patient management worldwide** 

 Fifty percent of acute stroke patients are on pre\-existing blood pressure lowering therapy. The primary trial results of COSSACS \(2010\) **\[G1, R1\]** informed the *National Clinical Guideline for Stroke 2016* for treating approximately 50,000 UK patients annually **\[E4\]**. The individual patient data meta\-analysis of all trials addressing the continuation or stopping in the immediate post\-stroke period \(2017\) **\[R2\]** mean that pre\-existing blood pressure treatment should be stopped until the patient is medically stable and able to swallow safely **\[E4, E6\]**. This guidance reduces cerebral hypoperfusion\-related brain damage from unnecessary antihypertensive\-therapy\-induced blood pressure reduction for 50,000 patients, and reduces pneumonia for 2,000 patients annually **\[E4, E6\]**. 

 Intravenous thrombolysis \(clot\-busting therapy\), the only licensed therapy for acute ischaemic stroke, is associated with an increased risk of potentially disabling or fatal bleeding \(symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage rate of two to eight percent\). The ENCHANTED trial **\[G3\-G6\]** showed that intensive blood pressure lowering was safe, and associated with a significant reduction in any intracranial bleeding and serious clinician\-reported bleeding but did not affect functional outcome at 90 days **\[R4\]**. This led to new *Stroke* \(USA, 2019\) **\[E6\]** guideline revisions for post\-thrombolysis blood pressure management—particularly in emergencies. **\[E6\]**. 

 Intracerebral haemorrhage \(bleeding in the brain\)—the most devastating form of stroke—accounts for 15 percent of strokes worldwide. The INTERACT2 **\[G2\]** findings changed four international guidelines. *Stroke* \(USA, 2015\) **\[E1\]**; *International Journal of Stroke* \(Europe, 2014\) **\[E2\]**; *Royal College of Physicians National Clinical Guideline for Stroke* \(UK 2016\) \[ **E4\]**; and *NICE* \(UK, 2019\) **\[E5\]** recommend intensive blood pressure reduction within six hours of onset, and to achieve target blood pressure within one hour of treatment. This new guidance is associated with a 13 percent shift towards better stroke patient independence, compared to previous guideline blood pressure lowering **\[R3\]**. 

 **Personalising intravenous thrombolysis treatment for acute ischaemic stroke**The ENCHANTED trial findings **\[G3\-G6\]** are cited in both the UK **\[E4\]** and the US **\[E6\]** for thrombolysis \(clot\-busting therapy\) \- the only licensed medical treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. Thrombolysis is used in approximately 15 percent of these patients, totalling more than 12,000 patients per annum in the UK. The ENCHANTED outcomes **\[R5\]** showed that for every 1,000 patients treated with low\- compared to standard\-dose clot\-busting therapy, 19 more patients would survive at three months. Although 40 per 1,000 more would be disabled, only eight of these would require daily care. The UK Royal College of Physicians National Stroke Guidelines newly concluded that “. . . there may be circumstances in which the treating physician and/ or patient wish to forgo some of the potential disability benefit from standard dose in order to reduce the early risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage through use of the lower dose” **\[E4\]**. 

 **Head positioning trial supports patient preference in positioning during rehabilitation** The HeadPoST trial of over 11,000 patients **\[G7\]** assessed the effect of two recovery positions—upright versus lying flat—within the first 24 hours of hospital admission following acute ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke on outcome at 90 days. HeadPoST identified that there was no significant difference in outcomes with either head position. NICE guidelines recognised that “optimal positioning is an important part of early acute stroke management and rehabilitation”. On the basis of the HeadPoST trial, NICE recommended “positioning people according to their preferences and individual requirements . . . to establish their optimum position, which should be individually suited to each patient” **\[E5\]**. Whilst reinforcing current UK practice, Robinson‘s findings remove the need for specialist, adjustable head positioning beds for the management of acute stroke patients, instead focussing on patient comfort and wellbeing. “\[When\] positioning patients with acute stroke . . . lying flat is often difficult and uncomfortable for patients . . . adding to a sense of disorientation after stroke, but may be of benefit for some. Sitting up . . . enables patients to interact with their surroundings and is a more natural posture for eating and drinking \[and\] often the precursor for more challenging functional activity such as mobilisation“ **\[E5\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel research led Traidcraft Exchange, a major NGO, to begin to assess the impact of its programmes on the wellbeing of participants and to change its development delivery strategy to make increasing women’s empowerment a major objective of its development programmes in Africa and South Asia. This followed their involvement in the East Africa Honey Programme, spanning Kenya and Tanzania, where significant gains in the empowerment of women were identified, along with improvements in women’s \(and to a lesser extent men’s\) wellbeing, using concepts and a methodology previously developed by Dr Gaines and colleagues for use within Zambia and India. Traidcraft Exchange are now using the model developed by Gaines and colleagues to evaluate all their programmes, placing wellbeing and women’s empowerment at the centre of their work.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Gaines was the Deputy Director of the Wellbeing and Poverty Pathways \(WPP\) Research Project, an ESRC/DFID funded study that ran from 2010 to 2014. Gaines and collaborators collected and analysed quantitative and qualitative data on individuals’ economic circumstances and inner wellbeing among participants in Zambia \(developing a prototype of the inner wellbeing inventory\) in 2010, and India \(developing a revised version of the inner wellbeing inventory\) in 2011. Given the longitudinal nature of the study, additional quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the same participants in Zambia \(using the final version of the survey\) in 2012, and the same participants in India \(again, using the final version of the survey\) in 2013. 

 Gaines and colleagues published several papers and book chapters \(R1\-R6\), based on systematic literature reviews and original empirical findings within the WPP Project. 2 of the empirical papers proved to be especially important in setting the stage for NGOs’ subsequent adaptation of the inner wellbeing survey and accompanying model for use in documenting the positive effects of intervention efforts in Bangladesh, India and Tanzania. Specifically, Gaines’s solo\-authored paper on the final version of the inner wellbeing survey in Zambia \(R1\) and co\-authored paper on the initial and final version of the inner wellbeing survey in India \(R5\) demonstrated that individuals’ inner wellbeing within remote villages of developing nations was best captured by acknowledging individuals’ distinctions among their experiences within 7 domains \(economic confidence, agency/participation, social connections, close relationships, physical/mental health, competence/self\-worth, and values/meaning\). 

 The conceptual work that Gaines and collaborators undertook within the WPP Project represents a major contribution in its own right. In particular, Gaines’s co\-authored review of prior academic and practical approaches to wellbeing \(R4\) not only offers a critique regarding inadequate generalisability of research within the “global North” \(mostly developed nations\) but also introduces a novel perspective on wellbeing that is informed primarily by scholarship and research from the “global South” \(mostly developing nations\). Nevertheless, results of empirical research from the WPP Project \(e.g., R1, R5\) go beyond setting the stage by providing the “added value” of multidimensional measures of inner wellbeing with evidence of high construct validity, as demonstrated by applications within the “global South” nations of India and Zambia. 

 The conceptual and empirical innovations from the WPP Project need not be applied solely to “global South” nations. A basic assumption underlying the WPP Project \(i.e., inner wellbeing can be conceptualised and measured as individuals’ thoughts and feelings about what they can do and be\) places Gaines and colleagues’ inner wellbeing survey and model within a tradition of viewing wellbeing from an optimal\-functioning or “eudaimonic” perspective that is associated with Aristotle and other ancient Greek philosophers. However, the WPP Project is unique in its use of qualitative pilot data from villagers within modern\-day Zambia, as part of the source material for quantitative measures of the 7 inner wellbeing domains within India and Zambia.  Clearly, the WPP Project is anchored in the “global South.”

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Traidcraft Exchange was created in 1986 as an international NGO \(complementing the trading company of Traidcraft plc\), quickly establishing itself as “the UK's only development charity specialising in making trade work for the poor” \(E1, p. 1\). By 2019\-20, Traidcraft Exchange were reporting annual expenditure of GBP3,400,000 \(versus a somewhat lower annual income of GBP3,100,000\), with more than 26,000 people benefiting in Africa and more than 268,000 people benefiting in South Asia \(E2\). Furthermore, between 2019 and 2020, women comprised most of the participants within Traidcraft Exchange’s development programmes across Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Namibia, Senegal and Tanzania \(E2\). 

 One of the major goals that Traidcraft Exchange identified in its 2011\-2014 Strategic Report was to “prioritise the needs of women in our programmes and activities” \(E3, p. 3\). During the 2010\-2014 Wellbeing and Poverty Pathways \(WPP\) Project that Gaines and colleagues were running in Zambia and India, Traidcraft Exchange began to consult with Gaines and his colleagues concerning the conceptualisation and measurement of inner wellbeing among women and men in Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Tanzania \(E4\). Although the WPP Project was not designed to address women’s empowerment in developing nations *per se*, Gaines and colleagues had made it a point to collect data from single\-mother households as well as dual\-parent households in Zambia \(whereas single\-mother households were virtually unknown in India\). Moreover, Gaines and colleagues took note of gender dynamics \(and, in some instances, gender tensions\) among their participants in Zambia and India. In any event, the working relationship between Traidcraft Exchange and the WPP Project proved to be serendipitous: Traidcraft Exchange documented that – as a direct result of their honey development programme in East Africa – not only did female as well as male beekeepers’ inner wellbeing \(measured via an adapted survey\) increase significantly \(overall, and especially within the agency/participation domain\); but female beekeepers’ inner wellbeing increased to a *greater* extent than did male beekeepers’ inner wellbeing \(E5\). 

 Honey production is one of the biggest sectors of agriculture in East Africa; and Traidcraft Exchange reported that, via the East Africa Honey Programme, they had helped more than 9,400 beekeepers across Kenya and Tanzania between 2010 and 2015 \(E5\). Thus, the positive impact of the development programme \(as documented by the adapted version of Dr Gaines and colleagues’ inner wellbeing survey\) literally reached thousands of households in East Africa; Traidcraft Exchange concluded that, by the end of 2015, their Beekeeper Economic Empowerment in Tanzania \(BEET\) programme in particular \(which ran from January 2013 to December 2015\) had exceeded their goals of directly affecting 13,800 people \(i.e., well over the target of 2,760 beekeepers and their families\) \(E6\). Consequently, Traidcraft Exchange’s success with improving inner wellbeing among female beekeepers in East Africa had led them to adopt an even more ambitious set of goals regarding women’s empowerment: “\[S\]ituate women’s empowerment within our broader strategy and agenda; communicate our commitment to women’s empowerment; and ensure that women’s empowerment continues to be a priority” \(E7\). 

 Outside of East Africa, Traidcraft Exchange pointed to promising outcomes of their Going Green programme \(which originally ran from January 2014 to December 2018\), which was not explicitly designed to promote women’s empowerment within the sustainable textile industry in the Indian subcontinent \(affecting more than 24,000 workers, disproportionately represented by women\) but has been re\-evaluated in light of women’s increased prominence in leadership roles \(E8\) – a change in power dynamics that also had been identified in the East Africa development programme \(E5\). Unfortunately, systematic data collection \(e.g., use of an adapted version of the inner wellbeing survey from Gaines and colleagues\) did not occur during the Going Green programme. As a result, Traidcraft Exchange have announced plans to conduct a follow\-up development programme in India \(following the success of the East African honey industry programme\) that will be more purposeful in terms of methodology \(E8\). 

 As other UK\-based international development charities such as Tearfund begin to adopt the concepts and methodology that Gaines and colleagues pioneered regarding inner wellbeing \(E9\), the legacy of the WPP Project endures within various development programmes that Traidcraft Exchange have completed: “The model of inner wellbeing developed by the WPP was both aligned with Traidcraft’s conception of ‘flourishing’ and applicable within our programme work. We decided to adopt the model and to base our assessment methodology on the WPP survey approach” \(E10, p. 78\). In closing, the link to women’s increased empowerment in the Global South was fortuitous, yet impactful.

 Malcolm was co\-investigator of “D\-BOX”, a project that changed demining practices in culturally sensitive areas, making an impact on industry, health, society, the environment, and the economy. \(a\) Industry: the project’s Cultural Guidelines, co\-authored by Malcolm, have become an industry standard. The Guidelines are used by demining stakeholders to navigate sensitive legal, environmental, and cultural issues. An associated impact, from the ensuing goodwill with local communities, is to prevent projects stalling because of local tensions and concerns. \(b\) Health / Society / the Environment: increasingly effective and co\-operative demining has had a positive impact on local communities who, freed from the risk of injury, are helped to repossess the land, and use it for housing, agriculture, or infrastructure. \(c\) Economic: improvements in demining efficiency have been cost\-effective for funders including governments, NGOs, and philanthropists.

 Unexploded ordinances are a global threat, an estimated 110 million scattered in about 70 countries since 1960. A clearance rate of approximately 500,000 per year means it could take over 200 years to clear all ordinances. Generations in affected areas are thus exposed to an on\-going risk of death or serious injury, often exacerbated by the fragile and fractured governance structures of some affected jurisdictions. 

 D\-BOX was a collaborative, international, multidisciplinary project, tasked to address the threat of unexploded ordinances. Malcolm was responsible for its Ethics and Governance components, and chaired the project’s Ethics Committee, advising on all research protocols. The project was a huge collective effort, involving 20 companies led by Airbus plc, with partners in France, Germany, Poland, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, and Finland. 

###  Research Insights 

 Research Underpinning Project Participation *:* Malcolm was selected as a Co\-Investigator of D\-BOX because of her research on environmental law, especially a body of work on environmental impact **\[R4\]**, environmental health governance **\[R3, R6\]**, risk **\[R5\]**, nuisance **\[R2 \(chap 4\)\]**, contaminated land, **\[R2, \(chap 9\)\]**, water security **\[R1, R3\]** and sustainability **\[R5\]**. Malcolm’s leadership role in D\-BOX was additionally based on her work in legal ethics **\[R3\]**. 

 Key Project Research Findings *:*  Malcom’s expertise left her ideally placed to explore gaps in standard operating procedures relating to: \(a\) integration of deminers’ work with local communities, and \(b\) recognition of socio\-legal and eco\-legal matters. She evaluated these gaps in two ways: First, through hosting a workshop series at the University of Surrey, with participation by industry, military, and NGO stakeholders and, second, by surveying demining stakeholders and workers across the globe. Results showed that the demining industry rarely considered ethical issues or communities’ cultural sensitivities. The research further identified the source of these sensitivities:  many unexploded ordnances are in areas with recent conflict, and low levels of trust in military operations. This affected attitudes to demining because deminers typically have a military background. Moreover, the study found that arrival of a \(usually\) foreign team of deminers could be seen as a continuation of hostilities; distrust persisted therefore even though the removal of mines causing injury, and death, and obstructing daily life might be seen as a welcome intervention. The research disclosed some basis for suspicion, finding evidence of potentially unethical practices by some deminers, reflecting a disservice to communities, and to charitable and governmental funders. In proposing how demining might succeed, Malcolm’s team found that community goodwill within the region is imperative: deminers need to work alongside local communities with overt deference to legal and ethical standards both to facilitate operations and efficiently to release land into ordinary civilian use. 

 Key Project Output: Informed by her research expertise and the above findings, The Guidelines for Humanitarian Demining **\[R1\]** are one of D\-BOX’s key outputs. Taking an accessible handbook form, the Guidelines assist demining stakeholders to navigate an array of legal and ethical issues that vary across jurisdictions **\[R7\]**, including: the possibility that demining itself may contaminate land and water **\[R3, R4 and R5\]** and breach contaminated land regulation; the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN \(which the Guidelines adopt\); human rights obligations; the potential for criminal acts to disrupt projects; and risk management. Considerable employment law issues are addressed including potentially discriminatory practices and rates of pay between local and foreign employees; and respect for local laws on minimum working age, contractual rights, and occupational health / safety. Malcolm directed each of these aspects of the Guidelines.

 **Incorporation of the Guidelines in an Industry\-Standard CWA \[S1\]** 

 Officially recognised by the EU and EFTA, the European Committee for Standardisation \(CEN\) brings together the National Standardisation Bodies of 34 European Countries. A CEN Working Agreement \(CWA\), once finalised, represents industry standards. The Cultural Guidelines for Humanitarian Demining, co\-authored by Malcolm, now form part of one such CWA \(granted for 3 years and renewed in 2020 for a further 3\). Demining projects are guided by the CWA in crafting their plans, processes, and methods of working to improve their ability successfully to release lands to communities. The Guidelines identify vital issues that must be considered by deminers \(and have not always been\) such as religion, gender, culture, and the environment. Further, they enable the industry to recognise potential legal and ethical ‘flashpoints’ indicating where work needs to be done in advance of, and during demining to ensure goodwill. The Guidelines also assist to resolve governance gaps: unexploded ordinances are often a feature of unstable political settings where systems of governance and the rule of law fail to flourish. Demining operators are able to draw on the Handbook for Deminers despite gaps in national governance and use it as a practical aid to good practice. 

 A considerable challenge in drafting the Guidelines was to ensure beneficial impact on varied demining actors: Demining Projects can be sponsored by diverse agencies such as the host government, the EU, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \(NATO\) or the UN. Implementing bodies are similarly diverse, including National Mine Action Authorities, the national military or police, NGOs, or commercial companies. Against this intricate background, legal precision is essential. The Guidelines translate sophisticated legal issues, extending to contaminated land, criminal interference with demining, human rights, conflict of laws, and employment law, into a format that is accessible across the demining sector as the industry standard, and transferable throughout demining operations. \(See **\[S3\]**, section on WP3 delivery\) 

  

 **Impact of the Guidelines on Demining Practices** 

 The project output does not just create an available industry\-standard CWA. More so, the impact of the Guidelines on demining practices has been significant. In 2017, Malcolm, along with CBRNE Ltd. \(a leading global consultancy group on chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive materials\), surveyed a group of organisations involved in demining projects **\[S4\]**. The purpose of this survey was twofold: first to analyse the impacts of the Cultural Guidelines, and second, to raise further awareness of the Guidelines with organisations who had little familiarity with them. Survey respondents included the military, research institutions, commercial companies, contractors, and NGOs. The assessment of impact showed the following: \(a\) respondents’ familiarity with the Guidelines was a direct result of the D\-BOX project; \(b\) half of respondents indicated the Guidelines had moderate, significant, or major consequences in informing demining practices; \(c\) almost half of the Guidelines’ standards had been implemented in respondents’ demining projects; \(d\) where certain guidelines had not yet been implemented, the Guidelines were expected to have significant impact on future demining practices **\[S4\]**. 

 **Industry Perception** 

 In her capacity as project lead for Ethics and Governance, Malcolm directed a team of military personnel, deminers, lawyers, psychologists, and ethicists. These actors benefited from project participation and results. The Guidelines were perceived by those outside academia, as a “ *force for good*”, \(Dominic Kelly, managing director, CBRNE Ltd\) **\[S5\]**. Stewart Grainger, a retired colonel and part of the D\-BOX project, noted that the production of the Guidelines was informed by sensitivity for the peculiarities of demining efforts. “The basic value of the input from the University \[of Surrey\] was informing us of the existing national and international law”, says Grainger. “It was comforting, after much doubt and concern, that the University accepted that humanitarian deminers work in unique settings that prompt the modification of some practices prevalent in normal industrial and academic circumstances” **\[S6\]**. 

 **Broader Use** 

 The Guidelines have had a broad reach.  Originating in D\-BOX, they are now also the foundation of a Handbook for Deminers, promoted by CBRNE, and popular with demining firms **\[S1\]**. Key advice and working processes from the Cultural Guidelines have been synthesised into an Aide Memoire to demining groups, publicly available from the CBRNE website. The CWA is positively referenced by the Spanish Association for Standardisation and Certification \(AENOR\) **\[S7\].** The D\-BOX project itself was widely discussed in submissions to the 12th International Symposium “MINE ACTION 2015 *”* **\[S8, S9\]**. The Cultural Guidelines have been further translated and published by centres for standardisation of many countries, including, for example, Estonia, Hungary, UK and New Zealand **\[S2\]**. 

 **Direct Beneficiaries** 

 The Guidelines have had an impact on the ethos and activity of demining. However, the ultimate beneficiaries of successful, co\-operative demining are local communities. Among the significant benefits to communities have been: the easing of tensions in what might otherwise be troubled relationships; improved success rates of demining operations \(releasing more of the natural environment to communities\); mitigating the potential harm to health from unexploded ordinances; and enhancing the possibility for communities to safely socialise, work and play. Funders have also benefited: by improving how deminers plan and carry out their projects, the Guidelines have led to more efficient demining activities, able to meet budgetary constraints. These results help save funders’ resources, thereby encouraging sponsorship of additional demining efforts.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Nene Valley Nature Improvement Area \(NIA\) is one of twelve flagship nature conservation initiatives designated by the United Kingdom \(UK\) Government in 2012. Research by **Professor** **Ollerton**, **Dr McCollin** and **Dr** **Jackson** was instrumental in shaping the NIA’s development. From the NIA’s inception, **Ollerton**, **McCollin** and **Jackson** have collaborated with local government, NGOs such as the Wildlife Trust and the RSPB, businesses, and the regional community to foster and monitor/map environmental, social and policy impacts. The research has: 

-  Led to enhancement/restoration of diverse habitats and ecosystem services across a 41,350ha area; 

-  Facilitated new models of community/intersectoral engagement with ecosystem services; 

-  Constituted a step change in regional policy\-making and green infrastructure planning. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 NIA status was awarded through a competitive process to support major, innovative evidence\-led collaborations between policymakers, local communities, conservation organisations, landowners and HEIs. As partners **Ollerton**, **McCollin** and **Jackson** directly contributed to the formative evidence review which shaped the vision for NIA. Specifically, plans for the Nene Valley NIA were directly underpinned by externally funded research including: 

-  **Ollerton** and **McCollin’s** assessment of the value of ecologically restored landfill sites for supporting bird, plant and pollinator communities, which included advice to the wastes management industry on how to improve landscape restoration **\[3.1,3.2, funded by SITA Environmental Trust\]**. 

-  **McCollin** and **Jackson’s** Natural Environment Research Council \(NERC\) funded assessments of changing plant diversity in floristically rich cultural landscapes in the UK over the past two centuries **\[3.3\],** and the role of hedgerows in maintaining ancient woodland plant populations **\[3.4\].** 

-  **Ollerton** and **Jackson’s** detailed UK case studies of how green infrastructure in urban environments support pollinating bee populations **\[3.5\]**, and **Jackson’s** Local Authority\-funded analyses of the value of floodplain habitat restoration for increasing local community environmental awareness and engagement **\[3.6\]**. 

 Building on the interdisciplinary work **Ollerton**, **McCollin** and **Jackson** designed, managed and supported a work package within the Nene Valley NIA programme focused on assessing, mapping and valuing the region’s natural capital and ecosystem services. This entailed three lines of activity: 

 **Mapping biodiversity and ecosystem assets.** Working with a post\-doctoral Research Assistant the team developed a process for mapping the Nene Valley’s natural capital assets, incorporating diverse multimodal data sources \(e.g. aerial photographs, archival sources, and 275,000 biological records held by diverse local and regional organisations regarding six taxonomic groups\) into an interactive GIS map **\[5.1, 5.2.1, 5.2.2**\]. The mapping exercise evidenced marked historic shifts in habitats \(particularly a steep decline in natural grasslands\) since the 1930s, whilst also constituting an unprecedented baseline listing of the region’s 10,000km of hedgerows and tree\-lines. 

 **Developing public engagement and understanding of ecosystem services**. The team worked to trial and optimise modes of public engagement and understanding around the ecosystem mapping. For example, **Ollerton** and **Jackson** developed and contributed to a series of community panels and consultations around key sites, issues and ecosystem services in the region. This process evidenced the significant degree of local, community knowledge in relation to ecosystems and modelled ways in which this local knowledge can be harnessed by policymakers, planners and academic partners in conservation projects. 

 **Modelling monetary value of natural capital**. The research assistant worked with **Ollerton** and **Jackson’s** direction to apply and adapt the Wildlife Trust’s EcoServ GIS toolkit to map densities of, and demand for, ecosystem services and model the monetary value of a range of diverse forms of natural capital. This process evidenced the substantial importance of urban areas as sites of, and drivers of demand for, contemporary ecosystem services. The analysis also quantified, for the first time, the monetary value of ecosystem services in the Nene Valley NIA at GBP109,000,000 \(GBP2,639 per ha per year\) with the majority of this value directly linked to recreational usage of ecosystem services.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The NIA was designed to co\-develop research led impacts with Wildlife Trusts, community groups, and policymakers in the Nene Valley. As the NIA was explicitly developed to foster sustainable, long\-term impacts, all impact has continued and accelerated after the initial NIA funding period of 2012\-15. The GBP3,300,000 invested into the Nene Valley NIA over the initial three\-year programme created seven jobs across four organisations, as well as grant\-funded contract work, which were sustained after the initial funding period **\[5.1, 5.3\]**. In particular, sustained work with NIA partners has enabled **Ollerton**, **Jackson** and **McCollin** to play leading roles in three key lines of impact: 

 **Conserving and restoring ecosystems**. A key focus of all NIAs was to support landscape\-scale interventions to enhance and restore diverse and threatened habitats. **Ollerton**, **Jackson** and **McCollin \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]** evidenced specific needs in relation to pollinators, flora, hedgerows and urban waterways and green infrastructures. This evidence directly shaped investment priorities within the NIA, which supported major new conservation initiatives that explicitly focused on, and sought to address, issues raised in the team’s underpinning research. The needs analysis undertaken in relation to pollinators, flora and hedgerows directly influenced programmatic work by the NIA to develop relationships with farmers and landowners to facilitate the creation and restoration of 115ha of wildflower meadow **\[5.1\]**, and a total of 1,500ha of land being brought into new Higher Level Stewardship \(HLS\) arrangements with agreed principles for grassland, fen and floodplain restoration to date as a result of the NIA **\[5.3\]**. Similarly, the needs analysis around urban waterways underpinned the NIA’s targeted support for river ‘greening’ interventions which have subsequently led to 350 local projects to improve water quality and river habitats across the NIA region **\[5.4\]**. The efficacy and lasting impacts of these ecosystem restoration schemes for wildlife and communities has been recognised by subsequent awards of EU Special Protection Area and UN Ramsar designations for several restored sites, demonstrating their continuing significance for over\-wintering birds **\[5.1, 5.4\]**. 

 **Developing community/intersectoral engagements with ecosystem services**. From the outset, the NIA was designed to foster new modes of community engagement and sustained multidisciplinary practice around ecosystem services. **Ollerton** and **Jackson** have worked to lead and sustain a range of community consultations and voluntary activities around key evidence, sites and issues which were central to the NIA. For example, they led a series of ‘community panels’ – set up with support from Sciencewise, a UK Government funded programme that helps inform science and technology\-based policy decisions through public dialogue – bringing together diverse community members to discuss legacies and next steps following the NIA. The panels demonstrated ‘a very high standard’ of debate and directly led to action plans and recommendations for appropriate management activities and increasing public access, for the Upper Nene Valley Gravel Pits Special Protection Area/Ramsar site **\[5.1\]**. In addition, local community members have continued to be involved in volunteering activities – particularly around ecosystem restoration and management – underpinned by the team’s research on flora and waterways. Community members have recorded more than 63,000 hours of time towards the restoration of habitats and ongoing mapping of the area **\[5.1, 5.3\]**. **Ollerton**, **Jackson** and **McCollin** have directly supported the continuing work of the NIA working group in sustaining intersectoral engagement which included land advisors, conservation organisations and farmers. This has played a key role ‘in prioritising and coordinating advisory and support services to farmers in the Nene Valley’. The team’s work in evidencing and monitoring impacts of the NIA has actively facilitated farmers entering Environmental Stewardship schemes, increasing the number of farmers participating in Higher Level Stewardship \(HLS\); thus, the amount of land under HLS rose by 5,750ha across the wider project area \(NIA plus 3km buffer\) **\[5.3\]**. 

 **Embedding ‘green infrastructure’ planning in regional and national decision\-making**. Testimonials from a range of key stakeholders in the Nene Valley NIA indicate that the most significant and lasting impact of **Ollerton**, **Jackson** and **McCollin**’s work has been the evidence\-based embedding of ‘green infrastructure’ as a policy/planning tool in relation to ecosystem services, regionally and nationally. For example, the team’s application of ecosystem mapping and community engagement to foster ‘green infrastructure’ planning is specifically highlighted as ‘one of the most innovative areas of the Nene Valley NIA’ **\[5.5.1\]**, ‘now play\[ing\] a key role in environmental decisions across \[Northamptonshire\]’ **\[5.5.2\]**, but also of national significance **\[5.5.3\]**. For one Local Authority Flood & Water Manager, the team’s key contribution has been to create a new approach and evidence which has transformed the practice of policy\-makers and planners, by making a, “significant input into the development of a methodology for Ecosystem Services and Natural Capital mapping and valuation across the Nene Valley and tributaries…I have been able to see first\-hand the impact that this work has had both locally and across the Ox\-Cam \[Oxford\-Cambridge\] Arc. This has helped provide an evidence base for habitat creation across Northamptonshire and Peterborough and supported in securing funding to undertake further work in this arena.” **\[5.5.3\]**. 

 The biodiversity maps and ecosystem services datasets created through the research are being actively used by diverse Local Authorities to understand the connections between biodiversity and ecosystem services. The team’s ecosystem mapping and valuation process has been explicitly embedded in a series of regional planning policies that will guide infrastructural and ecosystem development in the Nene Valley region over the next two decades **\[5.1, 5.5.3, 5.5.2\]**. For example, the NIA research led directly to **Jackson** being commissioned to co\-develop a new ‘Green Infrastructure Plan’ in partnership with Northampton Borough Council, Fiona Fyfe Associates Ltd, and CountryScape. Methods and outputs from the NIA work were applied to create an interactive map of ecosystem services and a series of evidence\-based policy commitments to be consulted in all planning, development and infrastructure policy for the next two decades **\[5.6.1, 5.6.2\]**. The Plan forms a required, evidence\-based point of reference for all developers submitting planning applications within Northampton and gives examples of projects demonstrating best practice for investment in green infrastructure **\[5.6.1\]**. An online interactive map identifies areas of green infrastructure in Northampton and allows residents to comment **\[5.6.2\]**. 

 The value of the underpinning ‘green infrastructure’ approach has been recognised in the Northampton Green Infrastructure Plan’s shortlisting for a 2018 Royal Town Planning Institute \(RTPI\) award, and in its widespread adoption in planning policy frameworks, regionally and nationally. For example, the team’s research has been used as the baseline and approach in major regional infrastructure plans in North **\[5.5.3, 5.7.1\]** and West Northamptonshire **\[5.7.2\]**, in the planning of large\-scale new residential ‘garden village’ developments across the NIA region **\[5.5.3\]**, and in the strategic redevelopment of Local Nature Partnership areas, including Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire **\[5.5.3\]**. More widely, the team’s approach to mapping ecosystem services and green infrastructures has explicitly shaped the development of regional planning guidance issued by diverse Local Authorities including those in Greater Manchester, Rutland, Teesside **\[5.7.3, 5.7.4\]** and technical guidance issued through the auspices of the Environment Agency **\[5.8\]**, Scottish Natural Heritage **\[5.7.5\]** and the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology **\[5.9\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Positive Behavioural Support \(PBS\) is a person\-centred approach to providing long\-term support for people with behaviours that challenge, such as those living with a learning disability and/or autism. Research from Northumbria University has led to the development of a novel workforce development \(WFD\) model, which directly addresses training limitations in PBS. Rather than training individuals, the WFD model focuses on system\-wide organisational and capability development, to effectively equip the health and social care workforce with the skills to use PBS. The WFD approach is comprised of accredited PBS programmes, PBS awareness sessions, new clinical leadership roles, and a community of practice. It has been applied across a workforce of more than 25,000 people and resulted in a shift in organisational culture, leading to more competent care professionals who are now able to use PBS confidently in their practice. This change has improved the lives of thousands of individuals living with a learning disability and/or autism and led to organisational benefits, such as increased staff retention. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Following scandals of abuse in private hospitals, the UK Government has recommended that individuals with behaviours that challenge \(BtC\) are transferred to community\-based care \( *Transforming Care* Programme, 2014\). For this policy to succeed, however, the community care workforce needs to be well prepared to care for individuals with learning disability and/or autism, some of whom may display BtC such as self\-harm or aggression. Positive Behavioural Support \(PBS\), which is a positive, person\-centred, values\-based approach that encourages long\-term positive changes in behaviour, supports people with BtC and improves their quality of life. However, there is a lack of skills, capacity and strategic implementation of PBS within the community care workforce, ultimately affecting the quality of care on offer. Researchers at Northumbria have addressed this issue by developing a workforce development \(WFD\) model to upskill the community care workforce in PBS \[ **R1**\- **R6**\]. 

 Traditionally, social care organisations have adopted short\-term, individually focused staff training models, with little consideration for organisational complexity, the development needs at all levels of the care system, or the high staff turnover in the sector. This has led to inconsistency in the provision, quality, accreditation, and transferability of training. In 2016, Health Education England \(HEE\) and Health Education North East commissioned the multidisciplinary team of Northumbria University researchers to develop a unique whole\-system WFD approach to upskill the social care workforce in PBS. As part of the research, the team uncovered an inconsistent approach to learning, teaching, developing, and assessing PBS competence, and an inability to demonstrate the competencies required to provide PBS \[ **R1**\]. 

 The aim of the WFD development process was to identify the competencies the community care workforce needs to support people with BtC, such as how to develop rapport with an individual, use effective communication strategies or address the behaviours. Uniquely in this type of research and intervention, a key step in the process devised by the Northumbria team was the exploration of the views of individuals with a learning disability \[ **R2**\] and their family carers \[ **R3**\], to understand the features of high\-quality support that make a difference to them. Both groups highlighted aspects that were consistent with key components of PBS: the importance for individuals to be supported by staff skilled in the technical aspects of PBS; to be treated with respect, dignity, consistency, open communication; and to have meaningful relationships with care staff. These positive approaches can help many individuals to live a life that can include employment, education, independent living and good relationships with family and friends: to ‘feel like just a normal person’ \[ **R2**\]. Family carers additionally acknowledged the valuable role of staff who provided emotional support to them as carers and emphasised how crucial high levels of staff knowledge and competence were to successful outcomes. They also talked of the difficulties for staff working within a wider ‘system’ and saw it as important that the staff should be supported by the system in using positive approaches in their work. This highlighted the need to develop and deliver a system\-wide WFD approach to PBS \[ **R3**\]. In a second stage, these findings were compared against the competencies highlighted in the PBS Competence Framework, which is a detailed framework of the skills, knowledge and actions required to deliver PBS effectively, previously developed by the team \[ **R1**\]. This was used to assess the existing competency levels of the current and future workforce to understand their strengths and development needs \[ **R1**\]. 

 The success of the Government’s *Transforming Care* policy, and implementation of a PBS approach, was also challenged by the difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff, which has an adverse effect on the quality and continuity of care \[ **R1**, **R4**\]. The research team developed recommendations to increase recruitment and reduce staff turnover, including improving the nature and quality of training, providing better support and supervision for staff and creating a more positive organisational culture \[ **R1**, **R4**\]. This research highlighted the need to build capacity within the workforce to provide positive values\-based, high\-quality supervision and support to staff, enabling them to use similar approaches with those they support. 

 Northumbria’s research \[ **R1**\- **R4**\] led to the development of a comprehensive evidence\-based WFD PBS programme in the North East of England in 2017 \(reviewed in detail in section 4\), implemented by a Steering Group, which consisted of multiple stakeholders, including the Northumbria research team, PBS practitioners, NHS and carer representatives. The programme created the infrastructure for upskilling the workforce in PBS and for promoting a wider organisational culture change to sustain it. An evaluation of the programme identified significant benefits of this approach in relation to: organisational changes, such as in strategy and policies; staff knowledge, confidence and practice; and improved quality of life for people with a learning disability/autism and their families \[ **R5**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Northumbria research ‘ *directly informed’* an ‘ *innovative and evidence\-based PBS WFD model’* for the North East and Cumbria \[ **E1**\], which is home to over 25,000 employees within 19 local authorities, 3 large hospital trusts, many independent service provider organisations and other stakeholders, supporting approximately 65,000 people with learning difficulties and their families. The impact is manifest in 1\) the implementation of PBS WFD across the region, leading to strategic and structural improvements; 2\) an accredited educational provision; and 3\) improvements in the lives of people with learning difficulties and/or autism and their families. 

 **4.1 Implementation of PBS WFD: Strategic and Structural Improvements** 

 Northumbria’s WFD for upskilling the workforce in PBS \[ **R1**\], approved by the Government’s Transforming Care Board \[ **E2**, p2\] in 2016, has informed regional strategy in NHS England and HEE for the North East and Cumbria. Judith Thompson \(Network Lead for North East and Cumbria Learning Disability Network, NHS\) and Charlotte Carr \(Learning Disability Workforce Specialist, HEE\) note that *‘the research was unique in adopting a systemic, multi\-component approach… to increase and sustain workforce competence in PBS in the region, in a manner that could be grown at scale’* \[ **E1**, p1\]. This WFD programme was delivered through the 2017 North East and Cumbria Learning Disability and Autism Workforce Strategy \[ **E1**; **E3**, p8\]. 

 Key to the delivery of this strategy was a restructure of the WFD staffing framework, including the creation of new clinical leaders \(headcount: 3\) and PBS Senior Clinical trainers \(headcount: 2\) \[ **E1**, p2\]. The three new WFD clinical leadership positions are strategic roles to implement and manage the regional infrastructure to support practice\-based learning \[ **E1**, p2\]. Moreover, this strategy established a workplace culture more enabling of WFD through the creation of the North East and Cumbria PBS Community of Practice, made up of PBS practitioners, stakeholders, and family carers, to provide a virtual space to make resources accessible and share best practice \[ **E1**, p2; **E3**, p8; **E4**, p13\]. The new environment was supported by new values\-based interviewing to appoint staff and resilience training to help staff deal with the stress of supporting people with BtC \[ **E1**, p3\]. The managers also established the requirement for including staff competence in PBS in commissioning specifications \[ **E1**, p2\]. The two new PBS Senior Clinical Trainers were appointed to deliver a programme of PBS awareness sessions across the North East and Cumbria region \[ **E1**\]. 

 Northumbria’s recommendations to address high staff turnover \[ **R5**\] have been adopted by NHS England across the North East region to increase staff recruitment and retention in social care settings \[ **E1**\] and as a result of the system wide focus of the PBS WFD, organisations have embraced new ways of recruiting, supporting and managing staff, including the application of PBS principles to the staff team \[ **E1**; **E5**; **E6**, p6\], resulting in improved retention \[ **E4**, p41\]. Many organisations have *‘introduced new, or adapted existing, policies to make PBS a central component’* \[ **E6**, p6\] or changed the way in which poor staff performance was addressed and managed, for example, differences in ‘ *things like disciplinaries and investigations because we are taking into account…whether we’ve provided them with everything that we could have for them to have been able to deal with that situation differently’* \[ **E6**, p7\]. These organisational changes have helped improve staff turnover, motivation and lower staff sickness levels \[ **E1**; **E4**; p41, p47; **E5**; **E6**, p7\]. 

 **4.2 Implementation of the PBS WFD: accredited educational provision and improved practice** 

 Northumbria University were commissioned by the NHS to develop and deliver three new free\-of\-charge accredited programmes aligned with the 2015 PBS Competence Framework and competencies identified by the research \[ **R1**\]. 317 staff from 30 local and national social care organisations involved in the provision of support to people with learning disability and/or autism \- including organisational practice leaders, practice facilitators who lead teams and support workers \- completed the programmes between 2018\-2020, and a further 60 NHS staff undertook the programme in 2020 \[ **E1**, p2\]. The programmes, delivered through a blended learning approach \(face\-to\-face, online, practice\-based learning, peer support\) are based on a cascade model, whereby organisational leads \(undertaking the ‘Leading PBS’ qualification\) provide supervision and support to managerial staff \(undertaking the ‘Facilitating PBS in teams’ qualification\), who in turn provide support to front\-line support staff \(undertaking the ‘Competence in PBS’ qualification\) \[ **E4**, p13\]. Participants of the training programmes were also supervised by the WFD clinical leaders \[ **E3**, p8; **E7**, p5\]. Thompson \(NHS\) and Carr \(HEE\) explained that ‘ *The cascade model on which the programmes are explicitly built mean that the learning has benefited thousands of staff and people with a learning disability’* \[ **E1**, p2\]. In addition, 15 people completed a bespoke Post Graduate Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Professional Practice for NHS PBS specialists, developed and delivered by Northumbria in 2017, to enable participants to use best practice in evidence\-based learning and teaching methods for adult education \[ **E1**, p2; **E3**, p8\]. 

 As a result of participating in the PBS programmes, staff reported an increase in confidence and knowledge \[ **E1**, p2; **E5**\], with learning from the programmes directly relevant to practice \[ **E4**, p7\]. A programme participant reflected: ‘ *The course was truly transformative. We thought we knew a lot about PBS, but we learnt so much more, all of which is completely translatable to the workplace. We have already noticed the difference what we have learnt is making within the organisation’* \[ **E8**, p3\]. The evaluation identified organisational changes implemented as a result of the programme, including introducing new or adapting existing policies to make PBS a central component \[ **E4**, p37\]. It also confirmed significant improvements in staff practice \[ **E4**, p51\]. Carr \(HEE\) noted *: ‘the skills the people have learned have really empowered them to be able to offer a really, really good quality of support to people’* \[ **E9**\]. Improvements include reductions in restrictive and aversive approaches, such as physical intervention \[ **E5**\]. Thompson \(NHS\) and Carr \(HEE\) described: ‘ *A significant shift towards staff viewing behaviours that challenge as learned behaviours \(that can therefore be influenced by changing the person’s environment\) rather than as being something inherent to the person’* \[ **E1**, p3\]. 

 The PBS awareness\-sessions run by the new PBS Senior Clinical Trainers have also had an impact on staff skills. 781 people from 102 different organisations from the community and voluntary sector, local authorities, NHS, police, Care Quality Commission, universities, and colleges \[ **E7**, p5; **E10**, p2\], and 16 family carers attended these free 3\-hour sessions. Attendees appreciated the value of the content and noted that it was useful to apply in practice \[ **E10**, p7\-10\]. One attendee commented that *‘This session gives staff an insight in how their behaviour has an impact on people we support’* \[ **E10**, p9\]. 

 **4.3 Improved lives for people with a learning disability/autism and their families** 

 The creation of the PBS WFD programme has led to improvements in staff practice, which in turn benefits the people with a learning disability and/or autism who the staff are caring for \[ **E1**\]. The programme structure educated participants to change their practice and impacted the culture within organisations, which ultimately affects the lives of the people they work with. Carr \(HEE\) observed that ‘ *Thousands of peoples’ lives have been touched in some way by this program*’ \[ **E9**, p3\]. In their testimonial, Thompson and Carr comment that: 

 ‘*staff developed and implemented behaviour support plans that used positive, less restrictive approaches…\[that are\]…more person\-centred and tailored to individual and developed in collaboration with them* \[leading to\] *improvements in quality of life of people with a learning disability, including increased and more meaningful contact with families and reductions in behaviours that challenge”* \[ **E1**, p2\]. 

 For example, a senior staff member commenting on the PBS programme was able to see the positive changes delivered through the new approaches as being responsible for *‘a 50 percent reduction in \[challenging\] behaviour, which is amazing’* \[ **E6**, p8\]. 

 These improvements are, in part, because organisations are becoming better at engaging with families of people with BtC, involving them with interventions and reducing the BtC enough to allow families to engage in activities again. An example of a positive outcome of PBS on one individual was described by a programme participant: *‘He has choice, he has control, he has independence … because of this greater family input. He’s able to spend a lot of time at home with his family where that wasn’t possible before’* \[ **E4**, p41\].

The research has been reported in 64 publications since 2000: 1 book, 14 book chapters, 25 research reports, 11 peer\-reviewed journal articles, 10 professional journal articles and 4 web\-based tools. 

 Enduring concerns about the inappropriateness of a formal curriculum for children as young as 4 years \(NI has the youngest statutory school starting age in Europe\) led to a substantive strand of research enquiry \- a large\-scale, quasi\-experimental, longitudinal  [evaluation](https://ccea.org.uk/downloads/docs/ccea-asset/Curriculum/EYECEP%20End-of-Phase%202%20Report%201%3A%20Overview%3A%20Evaluation%20Strategy%20and%20Curriculum%20Implementation.pdf), funded by the Council for Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment in NI \(£850,000\) from 2000\-2009, of a play\-based curriculum for 4\-6 year old children, known as the Early Years Enriched Curriculum \(EC\) Evaluation Project in 24 schools \(with approximately 1000 children, 24 principals, 150 teachers and 1500 parents\). 

 Findings revealed a positive picture of this play\-based curriculum in terms of children’s learning dispositions, social development and emotional well\-being \( [**RI**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09575140600760003)\).Despite depressed scores on reading and mathematics in Years 1 and 2, by the end of Year 7, the EC children’s scores mainly matched those of the children following the traditional curriculum. Yet the research evidence highlighted pedagogical challenges around advancing children’s academic learning through play, while still maintaining a high level of children’s interest, confidence and well\-being \( [**R2**](https://doi.org/10.1002/berj.3117)\). 

 The findings and associated recommendations from the EC evaluation were “pivotal” \(R3, page 21\) in the introduction of a statutory play\-based curriculum \- the Foundation Stage \(FS\) for all Year 1 \(2007\) and Year 2 children \(2008\) across all NI primary schools. FS teachers were now obliged to change their practice to ensure that children “experience much of their learning through well planned and challenging play” \( [NI Primary Curriculum](https://ccea.org.uk/downloads/docs/ccea-asset/Curriculum/The%20Northern%20Ireland%20Curriculum%20-%20Primary.pdf), page 9\). 

 However, further evidence revealed that the pedagogical dilemmas experienced by some EC teachers had not been fully resolved with the introduction of the FS curriculum. The findings pointed to the need for more radical thinking about the meaning of play as pedagogy in EY classes. \( [**R3**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09669760.2013.830561)\). 

 For the past 10 years, we have delved deeper into the EC data which has brought to the fore new thinking about the importance of playfulness as a central characteristic of quality teaching and learning in the early years classroom \( [**R4**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09575146.2011.579070)\).  Additional scrutiny of the data pointed to the need to move beyond the boundaries of play and teaching as separate entities, towards a more expansive and integrated early years pedagogy where playfulness, teaching and learning are more fully fused – an original pedagogical concept which has become known as Playful Teaching and Learning \(PTL\) \( [**R5**](https://doi.org/10.1080/03004430.2017.1369977)\). 

 Further elaborations have informed an innovative early years pedagogical framework, based on three key dimensions: the degree of playfulness, the locus of control and the nature of the learning taking place \( [**R6**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09669760.2019.1628011)\). Upskilling practitioners on these underpinning principles of PTL has been noted to impact positively on professional knowledge and practice \( [**R7**](https://doi.org/10.1080/09575146.2019.1581731)\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Shaping Policy** 

 Walsh’s research has been “instrumental” \( **S1**\) in informing the design and development of the statutory play\-based Foundation Stage \(FS\) curriculum in NI, impacting the playful experiences of almost 650,000 4\-6 year olds since 2007. Walsh continues to significantly influence policy: “a familiar face at regular meetings and seminars with key NI EYE policymakers and stakeholders” and provides “regular updates at meetings with DE representatives” \( **S1**\).  The significance of Walsh’s research led to invited presentations at the Chief Inspector’s Report dissemination conferences on 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> May, 2017 to NI stakeholders and primary principals \(n= 250\), presentations which the ETI Chief Inspector \(2017\) described as “invaluable”, “inspiring” and “very worthwhile sharing of best practice” \( **S2**\). 

 The impact of Walsh’s research has extended beyond NI, “informing the work of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment \(NCCA\) across a range of policy and practice developments in the Republic of Ireland for much of the last decade” \( **S3**\). Walsh’s presentation to NCCA’s Early Childhood and Primary Team in September 2014 on playful pedagogy informed the new statutory EYs Primary Language Curriculum, impacting over 6000 infant teachers and 180,000 children on an annual basis since 2015. Walsh’s research has informed the design of the  [draft Primary Curriculum framework](https://ncca.ie/media/4456/ncca-primary-curriculum-framework-2020.pdf). A playful pedagogical approach is recommended across the Key Stages, with the potential to impact all primary teachers \(approximately 23000\) and in turn all primary pupils \(approximately 560,000\) on an annual basis \( **S3**\). 

 Walsh was appointed by RoI Ministers for her  “knowledge and experience in the field” to the influential  [Qualifications Advisory Board](https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/c2e6b-qualifications-advisory-board-qab-for-the-early-learning-and-care-elc-sector/) for the Department of Education and Skills, March 2020,  with a focus on upskilling the Early Years workforce across the entire sector\( **S4**\). 

 **Influencing Professional Development** 

 Underpinned by the EC research on play and playful pedagogies, Walsh designed and implemented a bespoke professional development programme for FS teachers across NI: **31** \(6/12 hour\) Playful Learning hubs/courses were completed 2013\-2019, reaching some **930** teachers. 

 Having **“**gained much respect and trust among the teachers” \( **S1**\), the Education Authority in NI invited Walsh from June 2017 to develop these PL hubs into a series of three day courses as part of the Signature Project \(2017\-2019\) and Collaborating and Sharing in Education project \(2019 \- 2022\). **18** courses have been delivered to date, reaching a further **540** FS teachers \(on average 30 teachers per course\).   The impact on teacher knowledge is significant as almost **1500** FS teachers have been trained \( **S1**\), accounting for over half of all NI FS teachers, with further courses scheduled up until 2022. 

 Such training “has no doubt led to the upskilling of teachers to ensure the theory and recent research is put into practice in a sustainable and enjoyable way with positive outcomes for the children” \( **S1**\). Such feedback is corroborated by the ETI’s  [Shared Education Signature Project Evaluation Report](https://www.etini.gov.uk/sites/etini.gov.uk/files/publications/shared-education-signature-project-evaluation-report.pdf) \(March 2018: 37\), where the Stranmillis Playful Learning course is highlighted as an Example of Good Practice: “Staff now feel empowered to confidently deliver activity\-based learning and have the capacity to sustain this improvement” \( **S5**\). 

 Walsh has also worked closely with CCEA over 20 years, developing a  [repository](https://ccea.org.uk/learning-resources/early-years-enriched-curriculum-evaluation-project) of high quality professional development  [resources](https://training.ccea.org.uk/login/index.php) \(password protected\) and informing the  [Mixed\-Age Play at Parkhall](https://ccea.org.uk/learning-resources/mixed-age-play-parkhall-primary) project \( **S6**\) underpinned  by research on play and playful pedagogies to support delivery of the FS Curriculum which practising teachers deem “as extremely valuable learning and teaching tools” \( **S1**\). 

 In RoI, “Given Dr Walsh’s expertise and research activity in relation to teaching and learning through play” Walsh was invited by NCCA to present to, and work with the national group of tutors, 2015\-2018, as part of the Aistear Tutor Initiative \(ATI\) reaching over 20,000 teachers \( **S3**\). She has also been responsible for developing a series of professional development  [resources](https://curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/bb9ac07f-2eeb-46d2-a130-0abb0aa74cf6/ORW_InfusingPlayfulness_1.pdf?ext=.pdf) \(2015\-2016\) for NCCA’s online Primary Language Teacher Toolkit, accessible to all RoI primary teachers \( **S3**, **S7**\). 

 Walsh’s edited book \( [*Playful Teaching and Learning*](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/playful-teaching-and-learning/book245867)\) with McMillan and McGuinness \( **S8**\) is a “key resource for all early years practitioners” \( **S1**\) and “has informed policy advice developed by NCCA for the Department of Education” \( **S3**\). It has been well\-received by teacher educators and practitioners across RoI and the UK \(see  [reviews](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/mst/playful-teaching-and-learning/book245867)\). The initial chapter of PTL was translated into Danish for  [Leg I Skolen](https://u-p.dk/vare/leg-i-skolen/) and led to Walsh contributing \(by invitation\) a chapter for a Norwegian  [anthology on Play in Primary classrooms](https://www.universitetsforlaget.no/lek-i-begynneropplaeringen-1) \( **S9**\). 

 **Impact on Practice** 

 “The impact of Glenda’s research activity on practice cannot be underestimated” where “learning through play in the NI FS has evolved greatly over the years” \( **S1**\). Such thinking has been corroborated by the latest  [Chief Inspector’s Report](https://www.etini.gov.uk/sites/etini.gov.uk/files/publications/cir-2016-2018_1.pdf) \(2018\): ‘there are \(now\) more opportunities for open\-ended research, investigation and child\-led enquiry through activity\-based learning” in FS classrooms \( **S10**\).   The influence of Walsh’s research on practice remains significant throughout the Covid\-19 pandemic. Walsh developed a  [repository of playful learning resources](https://www.stran.ac.uk/resource-centre/ideas-for-active-minds/) for teacher and parental use during lockdown, reaching 33,000 unique visitors 08/04/20\- 30/06/20. Walsh’s research has created positive change that has had “a lasting impact on the views and attitudes of key stakeholders to create playful approaches to teaching and learning in practice… for the benefit of our children” \( **S1**\).

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 In 2014, Edinburgh International Film Festival turned its lens on Iran, a country whose image is overwhelmingly negative across much of the world, particularly Europe. Drawing on her research into Iranian cinema, Iranian society and Islam, Professor Nacim Pak\-Shiraz curated 23 of the Festival’s film screenings, many using the only copy in the world, and all Scottish premieres. Since then, her research has underpinned over 60 film screenings and events on Iranian film, largely as part of the Edinburgh Iranian Festival \- Film Season \(EIF\-FS\), gaining the trust of Iranian filmmakers and distributors to premiere work outside larger, more established festivals. This trust has proved vital in raising EIF\-FS’s international profile and sustainable growth, taking it from a biennial to annual event respected for its non\-Eurocentric approach to film, its celebration of female perspectives, and active engagement of audiences with filmmakers, curators, and researchers in understanding Iran through its cinema. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 It was while studying Arabic as a postgraduate student that Professor Nacim Pak\-Shiraz first realised the powerful role that cinema played in shaping people’s understanding of her native Iran. Studying alongside Western peers, whose perceptions of the Islamic Republic were largely based on the 1991 Hollywood film, *Not Without My Daughter*, she was repeatedly asked about the reality of life, particularly as a female, in a theocracy. From a fascination with the power of Western media, and the way it continuously shapes the image of the ‘Other’, she developed a greater interest and expertise in the lesser\-studied area of how ‘Others’ construct images of themselves. Since 2000, she has been studying Iranian cinema, with a particular focus on the role it plays in exploring the complexities of Iranian society and Islam. 

 The first of three main themes in Pak\-Shiraz’s research is Iranian film directors’ treatment of **religious and historical narratives**. Her 2011 book, *Shi'i Islam in Iranian Cinema: Religion and Spirituality in Film* \(3.1\), is the only monograph examining the engagement of film with Islam to date, sparking debate about cinema’s compatibility with religion and spirituality. Latterly, her research on this theme has explored recent Iranian religious epics, including ‘Qur’anic Epics’, in an era during which the representation of religious figures, including prophets, in Islam has been particularly controversial, and the creation of religious films a highly sensitive undertaking. The research examines how, recognising the medium’s power, the Iranian theocracy has used cinema to provide an alternative image of Islam and its prophet to those presented by Muslim extremists and Western narratives, while also claiming to critically examine Muslim sources \(3.2 and 3.3\). 

 In her research on religious films, Pak\-Shiraz looks at how Iranian cinema has become one of the very few in the Muslim world to have imagined and narrated stories of revered religious figures. In her work on **constructions of masculinity** in Iranian cinema \- the second of her key themes \- she demonstrates how recent Iranian films have skilfully used the cinematic language to narrate men’s stories of alienation and despair \(3.4 and 3.5\). Iran has been the focus of many studies on the subjugation and marginality of women, but little has been studied about the theocracy’s impact on male identities. In her research, Pak\-Shiraz examines a number of recent films with men as the focus, from middle class men in vibrant Tehran to men on the fringes of society. Challenging stereotypes, she explores how such tales provide a more complex insight into masculine identities in patriarchal society than has been studied to date. One particularly innovative strand of her research is on **female filmmakers’ representations of men**. 

 The final theme of Pak\-Shiraz’s research is on **continuities and discontinuities** in Iranian cinema over the last six decades \(3.6\). She examines the theme through post\-2010 Iranian productions, including films by both the established ‘maestros’ of Iranian cinema, and those of the new generation of filmmakers, born after the Iranian Revolution and the eight\-year Iran\-Iraq war. Engagement with the filmmakers themselves, including some who have spent years in self\-imposed exile, has enabled Pak\-Shiraz to examine consistencies, breaks and gaps in the oeuvre. In this way, she has been able to trace the development of style, themes and cinematic language in Iranian films, from pre\-Revolutionary times to the present.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Home to the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the world’s longest continually\-running film festival, Scotland has established itself as a leading centre for exploring global cultures through film. One of the key challenges in maintaining this position is gaining the trust of film producers and distributors to premiere new work, and of filmmakers and actors to participate in events, especially where this involves additional obstacles \- such as visas and licence agreements \- affected by fragile international relations. Over the past six years, research by Professor Nacim Pak\-Shiraz has enabled the directors and curators of Scotland’s film festivals to premiere new work by Iranian filmmakers, show older work that has grown hard to access, and bring Iranian perspectives, especially female voices, into previously Eurocentric conversations. Her work has enriched the debate around cinema by presenting Iranian films neither as an annex to Western Cinema nor as a window to the 'exotic', but as a vibrant, parallel discourse on the medium. 

 In 2014, Pak\-Shiraz programmed and led two 90\-minute panel sessions based on her research at the 68th Edinburgh International Film Festival. She also worked closely with the Festival’s then Artistic Director, Chris Fujiwara, in planning its various Iran sections, comprising 23 screenings of 19 Iranian films. Most of the films had not been previously accessible or available in English subtitles, many comprised the only copy in the world, and all were Scottish premieres \(many also UK premieres\). Drawing on her research into **religious and historical narratives** and **continuities and discontinuities**, Pak\-Shiraz was instrumental in persuading reclusive filmmaker, Ebrahim Golestan, to take part in a session bringing together masters of the past, a new generation of filmmakers, scholars, and Fujiwara, to evaluate the development of Iranian cinema. Audience feedback mentions the rarity of this opportunity, the draw of the directors’ *“perspectives”* and *“personalities”*, how interesting it was to see the *“influence of censorship”* and an appreciation of how *“new cinema \[has been\] emerging from older stories \(Golestan\)”* \(5.1\). 

 The following year, Pak\-Shiraz’s research on **constructions of masculinity** was used in the programming of the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and as the main theme of the Edinburgh Iranian Festival Film Season \(EIF\-FS\). Audience feedback was effusive; a typical email said *“So wonderful to learn more about a country and people that have been traditionally shrouded in mystery to those in the west”* \(5.2\). Of just over 200 people surveyed at eight film screenings and three post\-screening discussions, 91% said that they had learned more about Iranian cinema, and 79% that they had learned more about Iran \(5.3\). Prior to Pak\-Shiraz’s involvement, EIF\-FS was biennial, but the cultural and commercial opportunities opened up through her research made it viable to run annually at the request of venue partner, Filmhouse. The 2016 Season was moved into a bigger screen \(93 seats\), all five films were sold out, and four post\-screening events were programmed, including discussions with the filmmakers. 

 By 2018, Pak\-Shiraz’s research on **female filmmakers’ representations of men** had gained the attention of Iranian female directors and their distributors. This made it possible to theme that year’s EIF\-FS on Women Constructing Men, bringing together eight commercial and arthouse films at Filmhouse, including one screened in the venue’s largest, 280\-seater space. The screening of *Untaken Paths*, a film not often included in festivals, attracted a particularly large number of Iranian\-Scots living outside Edinburgh, due to the fame of its multi\-award\-winning Director, Tahmineh Milani, who took part in a post\-screening Q&A. Writing to Pak\-Shiraz about the *“outstanding”* Season, the filmmaker, critic, and curator of Channel 4’s major season on Iranian cinema, Mark Cousins, said: *“I was very impressed … The thematic focus was clear and relevant, the choice of films was original and illuminating, and the thinking behind the event was rich and deeply informed. I pride myself … on knowing about Iranian film, but I learnt much from the screenings and discussions … The audiences were considerable and passionate, and it was a real coup to have Tahmineh Milani as a guest.”* \(5.4\). 

 EIF\-FS founding director, Sara Kheradmand, has publicly said that *“We are not a typical Iranian Festival aimed at Iranians … The global issues, such as the \[theme of domestic violence\] in Untaken Paths, could be happening anywhere”* \(5.5\). It is hardly surprising then that such themes have extended the impact of Pak\-Shiraz’s research, and EIF\-FS, beyond film audiences and the Iranian community in Edinburgh. Survey responses from the eight screenings curated by Pak\-Shiraz for the 2019 Season show that, by the Edinburgh Iranian Festival’s 10th anniversary, 27% of the EIF\-FS audience was travelling from outside Edinburgh and the Lothians to attend \(14% from outside Scotland\), with 62% of people having never attended before, and 84% likely or very likely to return \(5.6\). Kheradmand has written: *“The film season is beginning to be recognised on an international level. We are definitely well known now by Iranian Film distributors from around the world, and our reputation and track record allows them to trust us and be willing to take part in the festival by sending us their films … The invitation of high profile guests, has only been successful because of \[our\] collaboration”* \(5.7\). This was found to be particularly true when, in March 2020, EIF\-FS was impacted by COVID\-19 and the Iranian filmmaker and women's rights activist Mahnaz Mohammadi recorded interviews to be screened alongside opening feature, *Son\-Mother*, when she could no longer attend in person to discuss her work in the context of Pak\-Shiraz’s research. 

 As the international reputation of EIF\-FS has grown, so too has Pak\-Shiraz’s influence outside Scotland. She has spoken on her research themes in Turkey, the United States and Iran itself; running workshops on Iranian cinema at the 2017 Fajr International Film Festival in Tehran, for example. In turn, international recognition and activities have enabled her to draw more Iranian talent to Scotland, including multi\-award\-winning Iranian female actor Fatemah \(Simin\) Motamed\-Arya as an Edinburgh International Film Festival jury member and ‘in conversation’ guest in 2018, and as EIF\-FS co\-curator and panellist the following year. Motamed\-Arya has said *“Nacim’s research on Iranian Cinema has enabled me to engage with audiences on a profound level, exploring together through film and dialogue the differences between how Iran and its people are perceived internationally and the more nuanced reality”* \(5.8\). 

 For Filmhouse, which is the hub of both the Edinburgh International Film Festival and EIF\-FS, Pak\-Shiraz’s research has opened up new possibilities to engage audiences in film. This began in 2016 with Pak\-Shiraz using her research on traditional Iranian performing arts to curate a pop\-up exhibition of 13 posters from the cinema’s archives as a starting point to discuss Iranian history, politics and society \- the first time the venue’s café space was used in this way. In the years since, the cinema has hosted an Iranian Animation Showcase \(another first for UK audiences\), and two EIF\-FS photographic exhibitions in its café, the most recent in 2020 curated by acclaimed Iranian photographer and former photojournalist, Laleh Sherkat. The Director of Programming at Filmhouse has said *“it was crucial for us that the Edinburgh Iranian Festival make its Film Season an annual event. The range of themes the research and knowledge of the region’s cinema has enabled us to address, in partnership with EIF\-FS, has not only given us a sustainable Season that attracts both returning and new audiences, year on year \- and industry guests of the highest calibre \- but also new opportunities to use our space that helps us contextualise the films we show and maximise the potential of our building and its archive”* \(5.9\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Nottingham research has transformed knowledge of the timing, circumstances, and cultural impact of the human\-instigated, global distribution of fallow deer populations. It shows that many contemporary issues in fallow deer management and conservation directly reflect historical changes to geographical and biocultural circumstances. Impact has been achieved by using this understanding to: 

1.  Change deer management guidance and conservation policies of specialist interest groups, deer managers and conservation organisations in the UK, Barbuda and in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \(IUCN\) Red List. 

1.  Create, and stimulate the creation of, interdisciplinary educational resources for the public in the UK and Barbuda. 

1.  Transform awareness of the significance of fallow deer for heritage and environment sector practitioners in the UK and Barbuda and, in turn, the communities they engage. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 At the University of Nottingham, **Sykes** \(UoN 2006 – 2018\) led a transdisciplinary team, including **Miller** \(UoN 2012 – present\), **Daujat** \(UoN 2014 – present\) and Karis Baker \(based at Durham University\), of archaeologists, geneticists, geochemists, art historians and anthropologists in research that transformed understanding of fallow deer. The AHRC\-funded ‘Dama International: Fallow deer \( *Dama dama dama*\) and European Society 6000 BC \- AD 1600’ project \(2012\-2015\) delivered the first transdisciplinary programme of research into the most widely distributed deer species on the planet. In 2014, the reach of this work was extended to include the Mesopotamian fallow deer subspecies \( *D.d mesopotamica*\) through research by **Daujat**. The results have radically changed understanding of the timing, circumstances, and bio\-cultural impact of fallow deer species across the world, from prehistory to the present. 

 This research shows that fallow deer are an excellent proxy for human diasporas, both physical and ideological. The timing and location of fallow deer introductions beyond their native range are the result of successive human actions. The research has shown that this was motivated by human attitudes towards the dominance of nature: that wild animals, a living representation of the wilderness, could be managed, bringing order to the natural world. These attitudes were discussed by Columella and Varro, writing at the time fallow deer were first being introduced to Western Europe. The team have demonstrated that similar worldviews drove subsequent translocations of the species in Medieval Europe and across the globe as part of colonial expansion to the ‘New World’. UoN\-led transdisciplinary investigations of the physical and cultural circumstances of fallow deer through time has provided interpretation that is impactful for a range of disciplines and audiences. Three key results of this research served to underpin the subsequent programme of impact: 

 \(1\) Understanding when historical fallow deer populations were translocated, and the associated cultural reasons for doing so. Received wisdom suggested that fallow deer were native to Anatolia \(modern\-day Turkey\), but the research identified previously unknown glacial refugia for the species **\(1\)**. Fallow deer became culturally important within these native distributions in ways that later influenced Greek and Roman culture **\(2\)**. From the 1<sup>st</sup> century AD, fallow deer were translocated through Europe and into Britain, where they were imparked at high status sites, such as Fishbourne Roman Palace, as symbols of identity and status. Fallow deer are a proxy for the movement of the accompanying people, but also for the movement of cultural ideas and attitudes to the natural world **\(2\)**. 

 \(2\) Identification of an extirpation of Roman fallow deer populations in Britain, with a later re\-introduction **,** spurring the fashion for Medieval deer parks **\(3\)**. Practices associated with hunting fallow deer became central to society as highly ritualised markers of status **\(4\)**. Medieval and post\-Medieval groups that delighted in fallow deer, took populations with them as they navigated a growing empire. This continued the spread of fallow deer, their cultural significance and associated worldviews **\(4\-5\)**. 

 \(3\) Contextualising the present\-day problem of overstocking of fallow deer in Britain as a legacy of the introduction of Medieval hunting stock. Associated legacy solutions, like hunting or \(in the modern vernacular\) culling, are unpopular with the public but management is necessary for deer and environmental health **\(5\)**. In other parts of the world, modern fallow deer populations have become culturally iconic but have problematic conservation status. In Barbuda, this legacy can be traced to 18<sup>th</sup>\-century colonial movement of fallow deer populations from Britain **\(6\)**.

1.  **Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 Globally, fallow deer populations are simultaneously considered to be domestic and translocated, feral and invasive, wild and endangered, locally extinct and subject to rewilding campaigns. This patchwork of understanding and research oversight of the biocultural significance of this species, meant there was little comprehension of how this species came to occupy a wide range of environmental and cultural niches. UoN\-led research has addressed this, with outcomes that have shaped conservation policies, changed deer management practices and built sustainable capacity for a wider understanding of the cultural significance of this species around the world. 

1.  **Shape deer management and conservation policies** 

 The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s \(IUCN\) Red List is globally recognised as the most authoritative guide on the status of biological diversity, compiling threats to species, their ecological distribution and requirements, and information on conservation actions that should be taken to reduce risk of extinction. It is consulted by governments, organisations, and individuals to understand and mitigate conservation issues. When updating the Red List entry for Persian fallow deer in 2015, the IUCN executive approached researchers on UoN\-led fallow deer projects \( **Daujat** and Baker\) to contribute to the international guidance on extant but endangered populations in Israel and Iran. 20% of the current \(2015\) Red List entry has changed from the preceding \(2013\) entry in areas such as Geographic Range, Threats and Population, directly reflecting input drawn from our research **\[A\]**. 

 In Barbuda, where fallow deer are a source of pride and national identity, the effects of Hurricane Irma significantly threatened translocated populations of the species. UoN research **\(6\)** was used by the director of NGO Barbuda Research Complex, to inform the deer preservation and conservation work on the island **\[B\]**. As the Director noted: “ *The research is the only existing scientific information on the Barbuda fallow deer and in this regard it presents an invaluable resource for the conservation effort, given that the deer is facing extinction… we are now working towards embedding these findings into policy recommendations for Barbuda’s government…* *the findings are providing valuable input to influence governmental priorities regarding the preservation of deer*” **\[B\]**. 

 In Britain, the team used findings from our research to change the decision\-making practices of organisations and individuals who manage deer. These engagements occurred through 25 talks to special interest groups, such as the British Deer Society, the Deer Initiative, the Ministry of Defence, the Small Woods Association and the National Trust and independent deer managers. Individual events regularly attracted up to 50 people. Leading Deer Welfare Specialist, who consults with all of these groups, and provides veterinary services to c.5000 deer on deer parks and farms in the UK, explained how the research affected this change in practice in three important ways **\[C\]**: 

 1\) Refined the culling strategies of deer managers and deer park keepers through the application of the new method for ageing fallow deer developed by the Dama International team **\(7\)**, ensuring that herd size is managed through informed decision making. 

 2\) Informed new clinical understandings of bovine tuberculosis in fallow deer for deer managers, park keepers and vets, through this more accurate ageing of infected individuals **\(7\)**, which “will help to protect and care for the herds better but also contribute to minimising the negative financial impact of TB in deer populations”. 

 3\) Enabled veterinary professionals to persuade deer managers and park keepers to recognise the importance of out\-breeding **\[C, Dii\]**, by challenging pre\-conceived notions that fallow deer across the UK are genetically identical **\(1\)**; in turn this minimises the health risks associated with closed herds including “reduced fertility and/or increased neonatal mortality…. reduced immunocompetence and … \[increased\] susceptibility to parasitism and disease”. 

 In 2018, **Miller** provided evidence to the City of London’s *Epping Forest and Buffer Lands Deer Management Review* **\[Di\].** The results have informed 20\-year policy and guidance for the management of c.700 fallow deer inhabiting the 7942\-acre site **\[Dii\],** visited by 4.2 million annually. Head Keeper and Constable, notes that the City of London Corporation *“turned to Dr **Miller** of the Dama International Project for up\-to\-date research in overhauling…policies. The tender specified that the research outcomes of the Dama International Project were to be considered in the review”* **\[Diii\]**. Our research highlighted the cultural significance **\(3, 4\)** of the forest deer, underpinning all resulting policy to maintain the presence of fallow deer at the site \(in contrast to Muntjac populations\) **\[Dii\]**. An important finding of the research was to confirm that the Birch Hall Sanctuary population is not genetically unique **\(1\)**, thereby changing the relative status of these deer and the policies by which they are managed by their keepers **\[Dii\]**. 

1.  **Create, and stimulate others in the creation of, interdisciplinary educational resources** 

 In 2014, UoN Dama International researchers were invited to partner with Fishbourne Roman Palace **\(2\)** and Dudley Castle Museum **\(3\)** to create major new exhibitions for the independent heritage venues. Both exhibitions had significant reach: the Curator of Fishbourne Roman Palace noted that 30,000 attended the exhibition between September 2014 and March 2015. Feedback from the Palace noted the interdisciplinary nature of the exhibition, including archaeological science and natural history, which enabled them to reach new audiences by departing from their usual stories of Roman architecture **\[E\]**. Directly inspired by her visit to the Fishbourne exhibition, author Caroline Lawrence set elements of her children’s book *The* *Romans Quest: Escape From Rome* \(2016\) at the site, with reference to fallow deer in the text and explanatory notes **\[F\]**. *“Your exhibition convincingly argued that fallow deer were introduced by the Romans to the UK for the first time right there at Fishbourne. This was something I was not aware of before… and actually inspired aspects of my novel.”* *Escape from Rome* has \[text redacted\] and c.27 schools are using it as a class reader for Key Stage 2 **\[Fii\]**. 

 Another independent volume that draws heavily on UoN fallow deer research is Dan Eatherley’s *Invasive Aliens* \(2019\), which has sold 3115 copies internationally and was a Sunday Times, Telegraph and Waterstones Book of the Year. The author notes **\[G\]: “** *In the Dama International Project research I found a species that was particularly emblematic, serving to highlight many of the crucial themes that characterise human relationships with transported species… The research thus helped me appreciate and convey to my readers the complexity of the history of human animal relationships and the circumstances and consequences of introducing new species, not just the fallow deer, but also other species discussed in my book.”* 

 Between 2013 and 2016, the National Trust invited UoN researchers to develop a series of ‘deer unmaking’ events, accompanied by a resource booklet created by the team, centred on the history of ritualised Medieval hunting. These events have been characterised as *“provocative, perception challenging and engaging”* by National Trust’s Consultancy Manager **\[H\]**. They raised wider public awareness of the cultural role of fallow deer at historic houses and changed public perception of the role of hunting: Hall notes that this is *“now part of the Trust’s narrative at sites with a historical connection to fallow deer,*” **\[H\]**, examples include Studley Royal \(Yorks\), Charlecote \(War\), Calke Abbey \(Derbs\), Lyme Park \(Ches\), Holnicote Estate \(Som\), Dyrham Park \(Glos\), Knole \(Kent\), Dunwick Heath \(Suff\), Hatfield Forest \(Essex\) and Powis Castle in Wales. 

 Rollout of educational resources at Epping Forest \(June 2020, **\[Diii\]**\) and Barbuda \(July 2020, **\[B\]**\) have been postponed due to COVID\-19 restrictions **\(COVID statement\).** 

1.  **Transform awareness of the significance of fallow deer for heritage and environment sector practitioners** 

 As a result of UoN\-led research, the team built capacity amongst heritage and environment sector workers to raise wider public awareness of the fallow deer they managed in provocative and engaging ways, changing the outlook of the practitioners to this species, and therefore the information and interpretation that is presented to the public across a number of sites important to environmental and cultural heritage across the UK **\[D, E, H\]**: 

 The impact at Fishbourne Roman Palace included changing the way that curators, staff, and volunteers view the site, engage the public, and approach research with other Higher Education Institutions. Head Curator noted: *“the story \[of the Fishbourne fallow deer\]* **\(2\)** *has been embraced by all of our staff here and is now as central to our visitor interpretation as the story of the building and our mosaics. It has also changed staff attitudes towards research at the Palace – the overwhelming feeling now being that research is interesting, relevant and worthwhile – this has led to a desire within the organisation to engage with other projects in the future”* **\[E\]**. 

 At the National Trust, our research has been embedded in the training of the staff delivering property tours. For example, at Belton House \(Lincs\) which receives c.400,000 visitors annually, 60 staff and 300 volunteers now include information on the patching of the knuckle bone floor with fallow deer remains from the herd at the site **\(4\)** into their engagements with the public, along with wider research findings **\(7\)**. Deer managers at the site have also used the research to inform their walks, which take place four times a year with c.20 members of the public, meaning that some 480 people have been exposed to a perception of fallow deer that has been changed by the research **\[H\]**. Across the National Trust properties with deer management teams, the team trained stalkers in Medieval ‘unmaking’ techniques **\(U3\)**, which they have gone on to use as part of their deer management and educational programme. The National Trust notes: *“Medieval\-style ‘Deer Unmakings’ at the properties has helped to promote a ‘plot to plate’ approach to the annual cull and venison sales. Since the work of the Dama International Project, the estate has embraced the product as firmly marketed ‘Belton Venison’ where previously there was more circumspection in terms of the origins of our menu offering,”* **\[H\]**. Similar planned work at Epping Forest with environment sector professionals by **Miller** in 2020 was postponed due to COVID\-19 restrictions **\(COVID statement\).** 

 As a result of these changes, the Dama International project was identified by the AHRC as an outstanding example of impact and showcased it in their 10th Anniversary publication **\[I\]** where it is highlighted that “ *An AHRC project has overturned earlier theories about the origins of a much\-loved species…* *the project team have been working with the British Deer Society, the National Trust and inner\-city schools to highlight the cultural significance of the fallow deer herds as well as the need to manage the populations — several National Trust properties are now selling fallow deer venison in their gift shops and cafes.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

-  Increased informed awareness of the Bhopal disaster in UK, especially Scotland; 

-  Narratives of the Bhopal disaster have been better framed as a survivors’ struggle for justice against corporate criminal negligence; 

-  New action for solidarity has been stimulated 

 In addition, methodological innovations have contributed to education, professional practice, oral history and museum curation.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Between 2006 and 2009, Eurig Scandrett led the Bhopal Survivors’ Movement Study \(BSMS\), an activist ethnography and participatory action research programme carried out with campaign groups of survivors of the 1984 Union Carbide factory Bhopal gas disaster, in collaboration with Suroopa Mukherjee of University of Delhi, and two research assistants, Dharmesh Shah and Tarunima Sen. The primary purpose of the research was to investigate learning and theory\-generation in the Bhopal survivors’ movement. Scandrett has a body of research and publication record concerning learning in environmental justice movements, and the BSMS raised important sociological questions which contributed to the study of social movement learning, especially because most of the activists are not literate. The research was initiated whilst Scandrett was Visiting Scholar at University of Delhi in 2006. It contributed to Scandrett’s research portfolio in environmental justice movements, and has led to a range of academic invitations to speak and publish. 

 The research involved video dialogue interviews, participant observation, survey, focus groups and research feedback sessions. In addition to an ongoing series of academic publications, a non\-academic book was published on 25th anniversary of the gas disaster in December 2009 \( *Bhopal Survivors Speak: Emergent Voices from a People’s Movement*\) comprising translations of excerpts from interviews with survivors engaged with various campaigning groups, focusing on their involvement with the struggles for justice. This book has been used in academic publications as well as to raise awareness of the ongoing Bhopal tragedy, the movement’s struggles for justice, and to promote actions of solidarity in Britain. 

 As a programme of public sociology research, the quality and validity of the BSMS is assessed by its integrity to both academic rigour and accountability to its ‘public’, the former through peer\-reviewed journal articles and book chapters,  the latter through engagement with the Bhopal survivors and the wider movement for environmental justice and occupational health. The initial research project was followed by ongoing contact with the survivors’ movement.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Scholars of social movement learning emphasise the importance of learning *in* and *through* social movement praxis. The underpinning research was designed to understand the learning processes *in* the Bhopal survivors’ movement; the impact is focused on the contribution of the BSMS to learning in the UK \(primarily Scotland\) *through* the Bhopal survivors’ movement. The impact therefore, is primarily to key publics in Scotland \(students, musicians, trade unions, professionals\). Moreover, as social movement scholars have described, social change is achieved through the cognitive praxis of social movements shifting the knowledge practices of society. Impact on social change therefore occurs through changes to the practices, meanings and narratives affected by the cultural practices of social movements. 

 Public knowledge of, and meaning ascribed to, a major tragedy such as the Bhopal gas disaster and its aftermath is contested by social actors with different interests: movements from above and below. Corporations and an Indian State increasingly committed to inward investment, present a Bhopal narrative of a past, tragic, industrial accident, the \(passive\) victims of which are to be remembered locally with pity, and forgotten by the rest of the world. By contrast, the movement is committed to a narrative of injustice, against which survivors actively continue to struggle, not only concerning their own grievances but also against the ongoing global causes of the tragedy: corporate negligence, a logic of economic development and state collusion with capital accumulation \(campaign slogans include ‘no more Bhopals’ and ‘we all live in Bhopal’\). 

 Ten years after the research, during a visit to Bhopal in January 2019, follow\-up interviews were conducted with six key movement leaders, who continued to endorse the value of the research to international solidarity. Visits were conducted to institutions established with survivors located close to the Union Carbide factory site: the Sambhavna Trust \(a clinic which provides Allopathic and Ayurvedic health care to Bhopal survivors, and conducts epidemiological research\), Chingari Trust \(a rehabilitation centre for children with physical and mental impairments born to Bhopal survivors and their descendants\) and Remember Bhopal Museum \(a museum of the disaster and the struggle for justice, co\-curated with survivors\). Discussions took place with activists, and contact was made with key individuals outwith Bhopal. 

 The impact of the research therefore concerns the meanings attached to the disaster in public spheres, and its significance in terms of current industrial practice, environmental justice and human rights. 

 In the context of international solidarity, pathways to impact therefore take the form of education, publications and presentations, in which awareness is raised, knowledge is gained, and understanding of the significance of the tragedy deepened. This impact is manifest in a range of cultural forms, including trade union policy, song, ritual, professional practice and artefacts. These cultural manifestations of the impact, can sometimes then become pathways to further impact, and this is reflected in the impact description below: Changes to cultural practice; Embedded in trade union practice; and Methodology and professional practice. In recognition of the cyclical relationship between research, pathways and impact, this section is extended beyond the ‘indicative maximum’ number of words to provide adequate explanation in three key areas of impacts in cultural practice. Corroborating Evidence, referred to in section 5, is cross referenced with the identification **E.1** – **E.10**. 

 The integration of research and Impact generation has been noted above: impact that predates the census period is not included here, but of course impact since 2013 builds on what went before. It arose from earlier research and earlier pathway to impact \(eg the trade union delegation which took place in December 2014 could not have occurred without the visit of Bhopal survivors to UK in 2012\). 

 **Research\-Pathway\-Impact 1: Changes to cultural practice \-From education to song** 

 Education with undergraduate students at QMU on the basis of the research led to increased awareness of a younger generation of students. One student, Ingrid Neil, selected the Bhopal movement for an assessment and, on graduation in 2010, helped establish Scottish Friends of Bhopal, an unincorporated association. In this role she negotiated the installation, in December 2011, of a permanent memorial plaque \( **E.4**\) in Edinburgh’s Greyfriar’s Kirkyard, a centrally located and publicly accessible cemetery containing many significant Scottish graves and memorials. During the census period, this plaque has been a focus for an annual commemoration on the anniversary of the Bhopal disaster, with wreath\-laying, speeches, poems, readings from *Bhopal Survivors Speak*, and songs by Edinburgh\-based political choir Protest in Harmony. A separate survey of the choir conducted in 2014\(Benjamin and Scandrett, unpublished\) identified that 35% of respondents reported that Bhopal was an issue they had previously known nothing or little about but learned about through involvement with the choir, including at the anniversary commemoration \( **E.5**\). One of the choir leaders, a young musician and award\-winning singer\-songwriter \(Penny Stone\) subsequently composed a song about the Bhopal disaster and the survivors’ movement, which has been sung at public events \( **E.1**\).

 **Research\-Pathway\-Impact 2: Embedded in trade union practice \-From public lectures to trade union solidarity** 

 Presentations about research to Scottish and UK Hazards Conferences by Scandrett and Dharmesh Shah raised awareness amongst trade union \(TU\) health and safety representatives and officials. At the instigation of survivors’ groups in the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal \(ICJB\), Scandrett, in collaboration with Kathy Jenkins of Scottish Hazards Campaign \( **E.2**\), organised a visit to the UK in 2012 of two Bhopal survivors, Balkrishna Namdev and Safreen Khan, who subsequently met with TU officials and officers. This meeting led to a motion to the 2012 Scottish Trade Union Congress \(STUC\) Disabled Workers’ conference \( **E.6**\), to invitations to speak at other TU events and further expressions of solidarity. An invitation followed from the ICJB in Bhopal for a TU delegation to visit Bhopal for the 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary commemorations in 2014. The delegation of 11 TU activists \(co\-ordinated by Scandrett in conjunction with Kathy Jenkins and BSMS research participants\) resulted in other motions and invitations to speak, and the establishment of Trade Union Friends of Bhopal \( **E.3**\). 

 A motion from Midlothian Trade Union Council in 2019 to the STUC \(whose 39 affiliates represent 540,000 workers in Scotland\) “welcomes the development of Trade Union Friends of Bhopal in Scotland and urges affiliation and support for this essential campaign. Congress calls on the STUC to liaise with relevant survivors’ groups and trade unions in Bhopal, and write to appropriate Indian decision makers in support of their demands for justice” \( **E.6**\). The latter call to action is a direct result of the 2019 research follow\-up interviews conducted by Scandrett. In September 2019, in liaison with Scandrett and his Bhopal contacts, a letter in support of the Bhopal survivors’ demands was sent by the STUC General Secretary \(GS\) Grahame Smith to the Indian High Commissioner Mrs Ruchi Ghanashyam \( **E.7**\). Following a presentation at the 2020 \(online, due to COVID\-19\) commemoration and conference by survivor Sanjay Verma, TU Friends of Bhopal resolved to follow up this correspondence. Scottish Hazards Campaign issued an invitation for Scandrett to speak at STUC Health and Safety Representatives Development course in January 2021.

 The value of solidarity activity is attested to in interviews with Bhopal movement leaders and trade union activists \( **E.8**\). 

 **Research\-Pathway\-Impact 3: Methodology and professional practice** 

 In the BSMS, research objectives, methodology and methods were determined in collaboration with Indian co\-researchers and key activists in Bhopal. Methodology was designed, based on Freirean dialogue, to optimise the input of survivor\-activists in deliberation and analysis of data. As activist ethnography and participatory action research, solidarity action continues to be part of the research’s action outcome. Researchers participated in campaign activities of survivors and solidarity activists, and Scandrett has maintained dialogue with survivors in Bhopal for solidarity activities in Britain. The methodology, moreover, has impacted the work of other professional practices \(museum curation, political research, social work, community education etc\), as evidenced through testimonials and publications. 

 Shalini Sharma, a former organiser with Students for Bhopal in India and activist in the Remember Bhopal Trust, and who subsequently completed a PhD and commenced an academic career, noted the influence of BSMS on her own work on the media \( **E.9**\), including the survivor co\-curated Remember Bhopal Museum, which opened on 30th anniversary in 2014 \(and covered in the Scottish press by embedded journalist and NUJ participant in delegation to Bhopal, Rob Edwards\). 

 These methodological innovations led to an invitation from Dip Kapoor, Professor, Social Justice & International Studies in Education at University of Alberta, to write a chapter for a book on *Research, Political Engagement and Dispossession* \(2019, co\-authored with Sharma\). The methodology of activist ethnography has also been recognised in social work professional practice, leading to an invitation to contribute a chapter to the *Routledge* *Handbook on Post\-colonial Social Work and Indigenous Development Perspectives from the South* \(2019\) *.* This in turn has been cited as relevant to the professional practice of community education by Marjorie Mayo in her 2020 publication *Community\-based learning and social movements: Popular Education in a Populist Age* \( **E.10**\) *.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Expressive writing \(EW\) is a form of imaginative writing that places emotional expression at the centre of post\-trauma recovery. Through face\-to\-face and, since the Covid\-19 pandemic, web\-based research and training projects, developed collaboratively with stakeholders in Iraq, Lebanon, and the UK Jensen has trained 259 rights advocates and overseen deployment of EW methodology to extremely vulnerable populations, reaching over 23,096 trauma, conflict, and gender\-based violence survivors. The resulting testimonies, and Jensen’s methodology, have engendered a shift in policy and training protocols for the United Nations Development Project in Iraq, local charities in Iraq and Lebanon, and UK government and private sector bodies. These organisations have, thus, attained their goals to build highly efficient, cost\-effective, and sustainable programmes, which support vulnerable populations, social cohesion, and cultural recovery. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 As Co\-Director of Kingston’s Writing Cultures Research Group \(and director of its forerunner, the Life Narrative Research Group, established 2007\), Jensen has developed an international reputation for innovative research at the interface of life writing, narratives of trauma and the advancement of social cohesion. Jensen’s article on the relationship between life\-story\-telling and human rights, published in her co\-edited collection *We Shall Bear Witness: Life Narratives and Human Rights* **\[R1\]**, is widely considered foundational to the new interdisciplinary study of literature and human rights. A related study of the legibility of rights and traumatic experience in autobiographical writing appeared in another prestigious edited collection **\[R2\]**. Jensen’s developing expertise on the impact of traumatic experiences on the survivors’ ability to tell their stories led to the publication of her widely read and ground\-breaking interdisciplinary monograph *The Art and Science of Trauma and The Autobiographical: Negotiated Truths* **\[R3\].** Drawing on the latest research on the biological and psychological origins of trauma, Jensen elucidated and explained the complexity of the relations between life stories, traumatic disorders, and the advancement of social cohesion. This firmly established Jensen as a leading voice in this field. 

 Jensen’s publications on trauma, imaginative writing, and testimony led to a collaboration with Open University\-based poet Dr Siobhan Campbell, resulting in the formation of the Military Writing Network in 2009, which was the subject of a REF2014 impact case study. Their work uses the EW methodology developed by Professor James Pennebaker in the 1980s for use in rights\-building contexts. EW is a humanities\-based intervention often used with survivors of trauma: participants are asked to write freely and without self\-editing about past traumatic experiences, usually for a set period of time over a number of days. It has showed the therapeutic benefit of expressing thoughts and feelings in writing on troubling topics. 

 Jensen’s current EW projects significantly broaden the scope of Pennebaker’s EW methodology both theoretically, by drawing on Jensen’s expertise on the science of trauma and the art of its representation, and demographically, by deploying EW to address specific challenges facing those in conflict and post\-conflict contexts. 

 As mentors \(since 2011\) for the John Smith Memorial Trust \(JSMT\), Jensen and Campbell helped young leaders from the Middle East develop effective narratives for their advocacy work. In 2015, they began to collaborate with two of these leaders, developing and adapting the EW methodology for use in conflict and post\-conflict settings, drawing on Jensen’s research on trauma, storytelling, and social cohesion. This research has demonstrated the effectiveness of EW methods for supporting the well\-being of vulnerable populations in conflict and post\-conflict regions without the danger of triggering undiagnosed trauma **\[R4\]**. Jensen and Campbell have since trained human rights advocates in the EW methodology and overseen its deployment to support more than 20,000 vulnerable people in multiple regions across the world. Their co\-authored *Expressive Life Writing Handbook* **\[R5\]**, published in English and Arabic, presents and evidences their methodology which has now been adopted by local human rights defenders in post\-conflict settings in Iraq and Lebanon. Since the Covid\-19 pandemic, these materials have been further translated, adapted, and digitised for access to both social workers aiming to prevent domestic violence across Iraq, and to support the wellbeing of frontline health care workers in Italy, the UK, and across the Arab\-speaking world.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Expressive Writing Project \(EWP\) has shaped the practices of non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\), governments, and private sector bodies supporting trauma survivors after conflicts and disasters in the UK and Middle East; supported by funding of over GBP88,000 from the UK government, AHRC, and the private sector. It provides an alternative toolkit for supporting vulnerable groups, notably female survivors of gender\-based violence, when traditional mental health tools are not available or are hard to access by those most in need. Jensen’s EWP has reached an estimated total of 259 professionals and at least 23,096 survivors in some of the world’s most unstable and/or dangerous regions. Equally significantly, the EWP has developed in collaboration with local experts and those survivors who have used the EWP. They have embedded further knowledge and expertise into the EWP. In turn, the testimonies of these women, often from minority and/or marginalised groups within their home context, have gone on to shape local and international agencies’ and NGO’s responses to trauma and gender\-based violence in war and displaced communities. 

 **Iraq** 

 In 2016, Jensen and Campbell collaborated with UK\-based social enterprise ‘The Stabilisation and Recovery Network \(TSRN\)’ to develop an applied research project, funded by GBP9,952 from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\), to test the efficacy of the FCO’s *International Protocol on Documentation of Crimes of Sexual Violence in Conflict* \(2014\). The project involved working with INMAA, a women’s legal aid charity in Northern Iraq for women survivors of sexual violence amidst continued conflict and instability in the region. The project delivered bespoke EW training to their social workers. A central principle governing EW methodology is to allow for the disclosure of strong emotions in a slow, safe, and detached form, making it a less harmful way of gathering testimony from those who have been traumatised. The FCO’s existing interview protocols, on the other hand, were mainly driven by the legal aims of procuring consistent narratives for statistical evidence. Jensen’s research suggested that this approach might unwittingly re\-traumatise survivors **.** 

 The project thus adapted those protocols to incorporate EW methodology and trained interviewers to provide active emotional support to survivors in interviews. The project provided 12 INMAA staff with tools and techniques to gauge the emotional impact of their clients’ rights violations, enabling survivors to produce a narrative that enhanced their sense of agency and detachment, benefitting their recovery. Jensen and Campbell then created *The Expressive Life Writing Handbook,* and this new interview protocol has been deployed in 20 workshops with INMAA’s mobile human rights team; they have since interviewed a total of 400 women survivors across Kirkuk governate **\[S1\]**. The programme director of INMAA writes that the project ‘ *enabled the INMAA team to reflect on and improve their working practices especially with respect to the interface with victims/clients,’* and that the training *‘…has changed the way we work with victims,’* enabling them to help *‘…these victims to tell their stories’* **\[S2\].** 

 The value of Jensen’s and Campbell’s research was recognised by the award of an additional GDP2,400 from the FCO Human Rights Fund \(November 2016\) to bolster humanitarian support for Iraqi women stigmatised by their experiences of sexual violence. In collaboration with TSRN, 100 faith leaders and rights defenders were introduced to the EW Methodology and 15 trained via The Stigma Project **\[S3\]**. One of those participants, a strategic security expert and researcher at Baghdad University, cascaded that training to additional two further rights defenders and facilitated EW workshops in 2017 with 36 women victims of sexual violence including “ *women kidnapped by ISIS and survivors of domestic violence*” in Baghdad **\[S4\]**. He concluded that EW methodology was “ *very useful*” for supporting those survivors “ *especially in Iraq*” where such help is sorely needed in the wake of devastating conflict **\[S4\]**. Jensen, Campbell and TSRN then received GBP7,400 \(January 2017\) from the UK Cabinet Office *Countering Violent Extremism Programme* for a collaborative research project with 20 policy makers from the seven Gulf Cooperation Council \(GCC\) countries **\[S5\]**.  This also resulted in the production of a ‘training’ video with Arabic subtitles. TSRN concluded that the project helped them reach their organisational goals ‘of building individual capacity for increasing resilience and well\-being for groups at risk of radicalisation in the GCC and Iraq.’ **\[S5\]**. 

 In November 2017, two representatives from the United Nations Development Program’s ‘Support for Integrated Reconciliation in Iraq \(SIRI\)’ Project requested training in EW from Jensen and Campbell. This training led to the collaborative development of training materials for a five\-day EW course for 35 UNDP social workers from Baghdad, Wasit, Babil, and Diyala provinces **\[S6\]**. One participant went on to employ this EW methodology to interview 100 women survivors as part of her research into gender\-based violence in Iraq **\[S7\]**. Jensen and Campbell’s research changed UNDP’s policy on the documentation of sexual violence; they have now incorporated training in EW methodology for social workers, resulting in the creation of a database of Iraqi women’s stories as a resource for researchers. UNDP’s representatives confirmed that EW ‘ *is a key methodology in achieving community reconciliation in a post\-conflict environment and increasing well\-being for groups at risk’* **\[S6\]**. In April 2020, in response to increased domestic violence during the Covid\-19 lockdown, UNDP experts drew on Jensen’s research and methodology to develop a social cohesion project that trained 75 social workers from NGOs across 15 governorates in Iraq, providing support by phone and online to victims of domestic violence. In all, these 75 social workers contacted 10 women a day across Iraq, reaching a total of 7,500 women using adapted EW techniques. The UNDP concluded that the EW toolkit of research and training techniques had a ‘ *valuable impact*… *upon the practice and protocols of UNDP Iraq’s Integrated Reconciliation Projec*t’ whose objective is to support victims of violence and women affected by conflict **\[S6\]**. 

 **Syrians in Lebanon** 

 Since 2017, the EWP has expanded through a series of collaborative projects with Akkar Network for Development \(AND\), a women’s charity in Akkar, Lebanon, that works with up to 15,000 women annually **\[S8\]**. The collaboration was supported by GBP47,000 from the AHRC Global Challenges Research Fund \(GCRF\). In 2018, Jensen and Campbell trained 12 social workers and oversaw the deployment of their method with 16 Syrian women refugees living in two settlement camps in Lebanon **\[S8\]**. This work ‘ *supported AND’s strategic aims of developing and implementing local development projects that support our communities in Akkar*’ **\[S8\]**. In 2019, Jensen and Campbell oversaw these trained AND social workers as they cascaded EW training to 10 more gender\-based violence and children’s support specialists from AND, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund \(UNICEF\), and the International Rescue Committee. Since then, two additional AND social workers have run EW workshops with more than 60 participants from the camps. One participant noted that this methodology ‘… *helps social workers reach the stage of healing, and even overcoming trauma,*’ and that it ‘… *became one of the tools we use to help women express themselves*’ **\[S8\]**. A translated transcript of a video produced by AND details the personal impact of this program for individual survivors **\[S9\]**. 

 **Digital Impacts** 

 In 2020, Jensen and Campbell’s research has had further impacts, stemming from the development of digital access to EW materials such as the UNDP’s web\-based training of social workers during lockdown **\[S6\]**. In April 2020, Jensen and Campbell received GBP12,371 from the AHRC Global Challenges Research Fund to research and develop a range of EW digital technologies to support the well\-being of human rights workers, and in June 2020, they received GBP10,000 of private sector funding from Viaro Energy, as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility strategy, to develop digital EW material in several languages free at the point of use for frontline health care workers **\[S10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Fair and decent work \(FDW\) is the major global challenge of progressing job quality, wages and wellbeing. The exemplary Oxfam\-UWS partnership within the context of Oxfam’s ‘ *Sustainable Livelihoods approach*’ in its analysis of poverty around the world has been influential, contributing to social policy developments in Scotland. Our research, which started in 2016, has directly informed social policy developments in Scotland, as corroborated by Oxfam and others. Beyond this, we have worked with some of the biggest employers in Scotland to implement change, and ensure fair and decent work is being delivered – such as local authorities, the hard\-to\-reach small and medium enterprise \(SME\) sector \(including engineering firms, construction firms and retail/hospitality\), and most recently adult care homes. We have helped kick\-start a culture shift through our research on inequalities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 While many advocate ‘voice’ – essentially trade union presence – as the key to fair and decent work progression, our ground\-breaking approach is to work with organisations in order to instigate change. We have taken an innovative approach, including employer voice in the initial study, up\-taking a review of challenges facing local authorities, working with the small and medium enterprise champion of FDW role modelling, and most recently, by inputting to the review of social care in Scotland as a result of the pandemic crisis in care homes for the elderly. 

 The underpinning research, from 2016, has created and applied a pioneering intermediate model of FDW, and the identification of priority areas, through initial collaborative research between University of the West of Scotland researchers and Oxfam partners. The project as a whole was presented at the Scottish Parliament in September 2016, chaired by Keith Brown, who, at the time, was Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work. This was influential in the consolidation and extension of fair work as a central policy goal for the Scottish Government. 

 The underlying and cumulative purpose of our research has been to reach a range of stakeholders, within and beyond government, especially employers through civil society. If fair and decent work is to be advanced, it is vital that they are aware of and engaged in supporting organization culture and development \(OC&D\). We engage with employers lacking basic FDW – low paid sectors and small and medium enterprises, for example. Our research also seeks to influence employers with more sophisticated management systems, but narrow views of fair and decent work. This category would include large employers such as local authorities. Our approach is essentially qualitative, through interviews and case study research, to advance, in a combined way, a set of factors \(including low pay\) which organizations should be able to self\-evaluate on and contextualise and prioritise. Research can be an inspiring and accessible way of reviewing their own status as fair and decent work employers, to help identify and pull together practical and relevant strands of manager, staff and organization development. 

 Our contribution to the initial research was to identify the employers’ perspective on FDW using the pioneering Oxfam\-UWS partnership model. We achieved this through literature review, interviews and case study analysis with a range of employers. These included NHS Scotland, local authorities, energy companies, hospitality, tourism, and the manufacturing sector.  The main findings **\[3.2, 3.3\]** were that employers shared an interest in progressing FDW, but did not see that as being led by legislation. Employers and human resources managers believe that the creation of a clear and widely agreed definition of ‘decent work’ would be helpful, and they would welcome a simple way to measure it. Employers view responsibility for creating ‘decent work’ as shared with government and other key stakeholders. There are both overlaps and differences between employers’ perceptions of key features of ‘decent work’, and the perceptions of wider society and lower\-paid workers as indicated in related research. 

 Subsequently, since 2016, there has been further research adopting the UWS\-Oxfam model of FDW with Local Authorities, SMEs and the social care workforce **\[3.1, 3.4, 3.5\].** We interviewed HR managers in 18 local authorities, about their perceptions, policies and practices of fair and decent work. We found a perception among interviewees that local authorities are still ‘bastions of decent work’, but that there were significant pressures on this in the current and anticipated climate and resourcing regime, which could threaten that. Ways to protect and sustain FDW in the sector were needed.Subsequently, a sample of owner/directors in potential ‘role model’ SME cases \(7\) and surveys of employees in those was completed. We had knowledge of these SMEs’ reputation from our own systemic interactions and local authority business development networks. Cross\-case content analysis of these identifies common aspects of culture associated with these fair and decent work SME role models and “Business Champions”. Awareness of these who may influence other small and medium enterprise employers to improve their FDW practices, which was being facilitated by delivery of workshops on the research to employers through the Centre for Engineering Education Development \(CEED\) network. 

 Most recently, in 2020 and as a result of the ground\-breaking partnership, we received a British Academy special Covid\-19 grant to conduct decent work in social care research. This research involved in depth interviews with front line social care workers \(20\) and stakeholders in the review of social care in Scotland \(9\) producing a report that has been circulated within the Feeley Review and the FWC, as well as employer associations. Aside from the unprecedented media coverage we obtained \- on TV news as well as national press front page covers \- we had feedback in webinars with stakeholders that our contribution was triangulating and validating the emerging direction of travel of change. Care workers’ experience during the first wave of the Covid\-19 outbreak in Scotland evidence that pre\-existing issues and deficits in the care sector, in the context of decent work, were amplified during this time of crisis, some with greater significance than others.  Decent work improvements in older people’s care require a dedicated approach and specified institutionalised ‘regime’ for job quality improvement. Overall, Scotland lacks a ‘culture of care’, which values older people specifically, but also other people needing social care, beyond economistic views around productivity. 

 The initial research was funded by partnership resources and other resources from Oxfam, at an early stage in the development. More recent work on decent work in social care, specifically front line care worker experience in care homes for the elderly, has been pursued by Pautz & Gibb with British Academy funding.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Our Route from Research to Impact** 

 From 2016, employees and employers have benefitted from the use of the Oxfam\-UWS developed FDW model and contributions to policy associated with our research. We have influenced social policy and civil society, through social innovation, and by informing bodies including the Fair Work Commission. We have also contributed to wider awareness of fair and decent work factors, influencing employers, employees and advocates. The Scottish Government/Fair Work Convention has shaped its own activity on the basis of the work of the Partnership. Our pioneering research partnership with Oxfam has influenced policy makers to address FDW in various policy improvements. More distinctively we have developed a flagship training programme for employers and stakeholders on advancing decent work through Organization Culture & Development \(OC&D\). This has local and international significance, as we promote engagement with FDW worldwide.  Especially to influence those lacking awareness of the FDW agenda, as many SMEs are, or those with a narrow\- base pay level\- FDW agenda, as for example many local authorities. 

 **Socio\-economic impact** 

 Impact from the projects concerned with local government would be on the awareness of fair and decent work, and perceptions and concerns of HR and managers in local authorities. Impacts on small and medium enterprise employers are likewise about awareness raising and creating an environment of progressive change locally in Scotland, UK and internationally. **Reilly, Hassan and Tarbert** in the ‘Routes To Work’ KTP work focus upon third sector entrepreneurship and employability. They are helping to advance fair and decent work through companies developing more effective services which means more people back in work. They are doing this by supporting the social enterprise  ‘Routes to Work’ to improve their services, including creating a virtual reality product as a ‘3rd Safe Space’ to allow vulnerable groups to access workplace environments via VR simulations 

 We share a common research and impact space with many agents in civil society and government. Many agents are involved in raising political and cultural awareness of fair and decent work, including but going beyond the Living Wage. Impact has been through influencing policy makers to address these in various policy forums. 

 We can differentiate ourselves from those more concerned with advocating ‘voice’, essentially trade union presence, as the key to fair and decent work progress. We have rather sought to work with organization culture and development Impact; first by including the employer voice in the initial study; then by an uptake of review of challenges based on the report in local authorities \(presentation to Glasgow City Council HR managers Dec 2018\); then with small and medium enterprise champion of fair and decent work role modelling \(report to companies, web page presentation to Society of Occupational Medicine \(SOM\); most recently by inputting to the review of adult social care in Scotland.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Smart, efficient and sustainable infrastructure supports economic growth and has positive impacts on health, wellbeing and the environment. In collaboration with local governments, public and private transportation and built environment stakeholders, and over 200 companies, our research into infrastructure, systems and processes has impacted both policy and practice. Specifically, our research led to new policies on sustainable transport in two major European cities, a Smart Traffic Centre for the Abu Dhabi Police, new standards for mobility services, and improved operational practices of major housing associations. It has also impacted small and medium\-sized enterprises, which were able to create new products that led to a step\-change in market and employment growth. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research in smart infrastructure was initiated by the members of the School of Architecture and Built Environment \(SoABE\) in early 2000 when ITS and sustainable infrastructure practices were in their early stages of examination. Since then, the underpinning research has been extended to various thematic areas such as computing and sensory systems, data analytics and knowledge\-based technologies, and innovative business modelling. The research has produced Findings \[F\] that fall under the remit of smart systems and sustainable infrastructure. These are: 

 <ins>F1</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Delivering Smart Systems</ins> 

 Smart infrastructure is underpinned by the operation of integrated computing and sensory technologies that utilise information to support transportation services. In this context, SoABE has produced systems and frameworks for the design of ITS \(Research output 1 \[R1\]\), the optimisation of urban planning and the improvements of safety and security of critical infrastructure. The latter incorporates frameworks that have been applied for highway and pipeline infrastructure overseas, as well as the development of an application for construction SMEs, namely RiMaCon, that incorporates steps and timelines for more effective risk management practises \[R2\]. With the plethora of ITS that have been deployed over recent decades, the volume, velocity and variety of generated data requires efficient architectures that can receive, process and analyse them, as to support services offered in smart cities. SoABE has developed such architectures using state\-of\-the\-art ‘big data’ tools, machine learning applications and data analytics. 

 A big\-data processing architecture \[R3\] was developed as part of the OPTIMUM Project, funded through the H2020 programme, and its importance was recognised by receiving a further grant from the UK Government Department of Transport. The developed architecture has been further customised to support the implementation of a dynamic multiservice journey planning tool that can support the provision of Mobility as a Service \(MaaS4EU H2020\). Further extensions of the architecture will allow the integration of real\-time information in simulation models; research that is currently being developed as part of the HARMONY H2020 project. 

 <ins>F2</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Delivering Sustainable Infrastructure</ins> 

 To pursue sustainability, companies should integrate economic, environmental and social considerations in their business models. There is also a need to understand the precise juxtaposition of organisational systems and business models in terms of their value\-laden impact, where diffusion drivers such as people, process and technology are seen as core enablers of business agility \[R4\]. These models are the building blocks of how companies create, deliver, and capture value. SoABE’s research investigated the key carbon emissions reduction initiatives currently being implemented in the UK industrial sectors and produced guidelines on how CO2 emission reduction strategies can improve business competitiveness. In the Architecture Engineering and Construction \(AEC\)  sector, SoABE has developed a strategic framework for implementing ‘smart devices’, allowing the harnessing of decentralised information and improving processes via the implementation of the paradigm of the Internet of Things \(IoT\). Further, our research has highlighted the need for community empowerment to achieve long\-term sustainability \[R5\]. The aforementioned research accomplishments supported the attainment of grants in Section 3, through which a number of pilot projects were set up to demonstrate improvements for the energy efficiency and sustainability of the UK housing stock. 

 On a global scale, research explored the sustainability issues within the energy sector and identified and evaluated critical success factors, such as access to the grid, implementation of the legal framework for Renewable Energy \(RE\), coordination and communication, financial tools for RE projects, knowledge creation and exploitation, and transparency for implementing renewable energy strategies in developing countries \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Impact 1: Changing policy for the adoption of sustainable transportation and renewable energy initiatives</ins> 

 Our work in ITS and big\-data architectures led to the design and development of the integrated OPTIMUM platform \[F1\]. The platform was composed of six ‘smart’ components developed by five project partners, with a traffic forecasting engine and a social mining application developed by SoABE. The user\-facing element of the platform was a mobile application that is being showcased on the CIVITAS \(network of cities for cities dedicated to cleaner and better transport in Europe and beyond\) Directory of Tools \[C1\], highlighting its acceptance and recognition in the domain of smart cities. SoABE’s work, as part of the MaaS4EU Grant, on the development of a journey planner for Mobility as a Service has resulted in the creation of one of the first of such applications to be trialled in different European cities by hundreds of participants. The tool has been trialled in Manchester and Budapest, allowing the integration of multiple modes of transport, including private and public modes, ride hailing, bike sharing and on\-demand co\-travelling services. The integrated offering had positive impacts on policy making and capacity building at international level \[C2 and C3\]. 

 <ins>Impact 2:</ins> <ins>Enhancing risk management practices used as part of the operations of emergency services and construction companies</ins> 

 The developed risk assessment, management and mitigation frameworks and renewable energy strategies have received \[F1\] international recognition and has impacted on several initiatives related to smart cities in Europe and the Middle East. Specifically, developed frameworks have been used for the design of the Smart Traffic Centre \(STC\) of the Abu Dhabi Police Service \[C4\]. The framework actively supports the Traffic and Patrols Directorate of Abu Dhabi Police to closely monitor road traffic conditions and manage their relevant police operations, in collaboration with other branches of the Police Service and municipal authorities. As such, it has impacted on capacity building in areas related to enforcement and safety with the use of ITS \[C4\]. Furthermore, the framework has influenced policies as it underpinned the design of Abu Dhabi’s Safe City initiative, which uses integrated technological solutions for the co\-ordination and provision of emergency services within the Emirate \[C4\]. 

 The use of the Risk Management Guide and RiMaCon software developed as part of the RiMaCon FP7 EU project, led by Oduoza, has enabled the advancement of better strategies to minimise risks, thus positively impacting the health and well\-being of workers in the construction industry. RiMaCon has been used in the UK and Italy and has demonstrably improved competitiveness through enhanced risk prediction and pricing as part of construction project bidding \[C5\]. 

 <ins>Impact 3: Improving existing standards and architectures for the design of intelligent transportation systems and novel mobility services</ins> 

 As part of the first two Horizon 2020 grants mentioned in Section 3, SoABE has contributed to the proposal of extensions for the European FRAME ITS architecture \[F1\] that forms a standard for the design of ITS applications within the EU. These extensions focused on functionality that allows the design of proactive information services, and services for the realisation of Mobility as a Service \(MaaS\). OPTIMUM provides extensions for the implementation of personalised recommendation services, complex event processing and system aware optimisation \[C6\] as part of a big\-data supported architecture for smart mobility applications. Furthermore, MaaS4EU extends current functionality to include services related to dynamic ‘true’ multimodal journey planning, optimisation of supply and demand of services, and integration of ticketing, booking and payment for multiple service providers \[C7\]. 

 <ins>Impact 4: Changing operational practices and culture of organisations</ins> <ins>in the built environment sector</ins> 

 The design and deployment of renewable energy and sensory systems \[F2\] can positively impact energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions of infrastructure and housing projects. More specifically, focus has been placed on initiatives that improved the air tightness of buildings; introduced innovations within building materials to improve the overall structures fabric; deployed monitoring and control systems to reduce energy consumption; and utilised energy storage technology to optimise the effectiveness of renewable energy generation. Evidence generated allows major housing associations to understand better the impact of novel technologies prior to their mainstream deployment. For example, Wolverhampton Homes \(WH\), a major housing association that manages 23,500 homes, participated in small scale pilots that investigated the performance of battery storage units and smart heating control systems with a goal to understand the potential of such technologies in moving tenants towards more efficient energy use. As a result, WH familiarised themselves with these novel technologies and generated knowledge so as to inform future decisions regarding capital expenditure programmes \[C8\]. 

 <ins>Impact 5: Improving the productivity of companies which offer products that</ins> <ins>capitalise on renewable energy</ins> 

 As part of the activities of the BECCI project, SoABE has collaborated with approximately 200 businesses, predominately SMEs, in developing new technologies and integrated them in novel products and services \[C9\]. In doing so, we have supported the development of technologies for battery storage units and energy monitoring systems \[F2\] enabling participating companies to improve and expand their product portfolio. As a result, several impacts were realised including expansion of client base and identification of new markets that led to increase in sales, capacity building for employees, expansion of supply chains and job creation \[C10\-C11\]. In quantitative terms, two notable examples are: \(i\) AceOn has demonstrated 50% increase in revenues and 60% increase in workforce \[C10\], while \(ii\) Genius Hub has reported a 483% increase in sales and 75% expansion of its workforce \[C11\]. 

 Overall, changing policy and practice in the field of smart and sustainable infrastructure is making and is going to make lives better for travellers, road users and the society in general by improving road safety and accessibility, reducing congestion and promoting sustainable modes of transport. In addition, in the construction sector, our research will effect a step change in the exploitation of renewable energy, thus improve the competitiveness of companies in the sector, and help housing and infrastructure providers in meeting their sustainable development goals.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Kent’s Respiratory Clinic, established in 2013, is now recognised internationally as a leader in research and consultancy in respiratory care for athletes. Findings from Professor Dickinson’s clinical research on respiratory care in athletes and the use of asthma therapy have led directly to changes to World Anti\-Doping Agency and UK Anti\-Doping policy on the use of asthma therapy by athletes. 

 In addition, Dickinson and his team have helped a number of leading national and international sports governing bodies and professional associations to improve the respiratory care received by their athletes. Through undertaking research\-based assessments and providing training and resources for practitioners and policymakers, Dickinson and the Kent Respiratory Clinic have advanced the practice, thinking, and strategies of the GB Swimming Team, the Football Association, GB Cycling, GB Boxing, UK Athletics, Arsenal FC, Liverpool FC, the English Institute of Sport, USA Cycling, England Rugby Union, and Swim Ireland.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Screening and Identifying Respiratory Issues in Athletes** 

 In **2014\-15**, in the build\-up to the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, Dickinson led the first ever study screening the entire GB boxing and swimming teams for asthma\-related conditions. Athletes underwent assessments for airway inflammation and maximal lung function and completed an objective airway challenge \(Eucapnic Voluntary Hyperpnoea\) to trigger an asthmatic response in those with an asthma\-related condition. The research was undertaken in response to previous studies that found that poor respiratory care provision, misdiagnosis, and respiratory symptoms were more common in high\-level athletes. Data from the screening undertaken by Dickinson demonstrated that while elite boxers \(8% prevalence\) were no more likely to have an asthma\-related condition than the general population \(approximately 9%\), prevalence among the GB swimming team was 69%. Of the swimmers with an asthma\-related condition, 19 \(63%\) had no previous history or diagnosis **\[R1\]**. 

 This research provided significant new evidence of the importance of appropriate screening protocols to ensure all elite athletes’ airway health is appropriately cared for. A follow\-up study conducted in **2017,** using similar objective assessments, identified for the first time that the prevalence of asthma\-related conditions in a large cohort of elite footballers \(28%\) was greater than the general population in the UK **\[R2\]**. This latter research again identified that a large proportion \(37%\) of the players detected with an asthma\-related condition did not have a previous diagnosis. Furthermore, the study established for the first time that appropriate management of asthma\-related conditions using inhaler therapy significantly improved players’ respiratory health, demonstrated by reductions in asthma severity and improved aerobic fitness **\[R2\]**. 

 **Investigating whether Asthma Therapy Has an Ergogenic Action** 

 In **2013\-14**, Dickinson led an investigation by the Respiratory Clinic into the potential for asthma therapy to have an ergogenic action in non\-asthmatic athletes **\[R3\-R6\]**. Participants in these studies inhaled large maximally permitted doses of asthma therapy \(salbutamol\) up to 1600μg, either acutely or over a six\-week period. The investigations established that using doses of inhaled salbutamol permitted within the World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\) Code does not improve athletes’ endurance, strength, or power performance; but, when athletes lose approximately 5% body mass via water loss \(i.e. sweating\), and use the upper permitted dose of inhaled salbutamol \(1600μg\), the urine concentration of salbutamol rises above the permitted level, making the athlete at risk of committing a doping violation. The findings were, and still are, extremely significant in demonstrating that athletes using therapeutic doses of permitted asthma therapy inhalers do not experience a performance enhancement beyond preventing their asthma condition, and, should not, therefore, be restricted during competition. When the research was published in **2014**, it demonstrated to the World Anti\-Doping Agency that the current upper permitted dose of salbutamol, accompanied with an acute loss in body mass from dehydration, could result in an athlete providing an adverse analytical finding and a potential anti\-doping sanction **\[a\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2013, the Respiratory Clinic has seen more than 1,500 athletes from across the UK, Europe, the USA and Australia. The Clinic supported a significant number of the Team GB athletes who competed at the 2016 Rio Olympic and Paralympic Games, and continues to do so for the 2021 Olympic Games. As a result of his research on diagnosis and management of asthma\-related conditions, Professor Dickinson has provided consultancy and advice to sports governing, professional, and regulatory bodies, and respiratory clinics, both in the UK and overseas. In addition, the Respiratory Clinic provides bespoke training for sports medicine practitioners, sports physiotherapists, respiratory physiotherapists, and sports scientists, based on Dickinson’s research. Below is a selection of examples of how Dickinson’s research and expertise has significantly influenced these stakeholders. 

 **Influencing International Athlete Anti\-Doping Policy** 

 As a result of Dickinson’s research investigating the ergogenic action of asthma medication **\[R3\-R6\]**, in **2017** WADA modified the maximum permitted dose of inhaled salbutamol from 1600µg in a 24\-hour period to 800µg in a 12\-hour period, as well as the analysis of urine to account for hydration status **\[a\]**. This regulatory change has impact for every sport and  for every athlete who competes under international anti\-doping rules set by WADA. The WADA Senior Director for Sciences and International Partnerships has stated: 

 ‘Dr. Dickinson’s and his colleagues’ research has had a significant impact on the debates \[… and\] the decisions made by the WADA in 2017 to modify the maximum permitted dose of inhaled salbutamol to 800 μg in a 12\-hour period. WADA has recently \(2019\) also modified the analysis of salbutamol in urine to account for hydration status, and the research from Dr. Dickinson and his colleagues continues to play a part in informing the updated guidelines’ **\[a\]**. 

 Since **2018**, Dickinson has been invited to sit on the United Kingdom Anti\-Doping Agency \(UKAD\) Respiratory Steering Panel. The Head of Science and Medicine at UKAD has commented that Dickinson’s contribution to this panel ‘informed our knowledge and thinking around the diagnosis and management of respiratory conditions \[… and\] has enabled us to refine our existing policies’ **\[b\]**. 

 In **2017**, Dickinson was called upon to advise the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on issues related to athlete doping within British Cycling. Dickinson’s advice prompted the Committee to question management teams in elite sport on their approach to respiratory issues and informed the consequential report on ‘Combatting Doping in Sport’ issued in **2018** **\[c\]**. 

 **Advancing Respiratory Care in Elite Athletes** 

 Since **August 2013**, Dickinson and his team have worked extensively on an ongoing basis with numerous GB and elite teams, including the GB Swimming Team, the Football Association, GB Cycling, GB Boxing, UK Athletics, Arsenal FC, and Liverpool FC. Each team has adopted the Clinic’s research findings and changed how they manage and detect respiratory issues in their elite athletes. For example: 

-  For the GB Swimming Team, research by the Respiratory Clinic **\[R1\]** was used to demonstrate the impact of providing objective airway assessments for swimmers in the build\-up to the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games. This led the team to change their athlete respiratory care strategy, implement screening practices, and better monitor appropriate therapy use, with Dickinson’s guidance \( **2014\-present**\) **\[d\]**. Research by Dickinson and his team indicated that athletes based at the Bath National Centre had increased airway inflammation compared with those at other centres; this contributed to a successful £5 million bid in **2016** to renovate the swimming pool and improve the pool environment **\[d\]**. Since **2016**, the Clinic has continued its support for GB Swimming throughout their preparations for the 2021 Olympic Games. GB Swimming’s Athlete Health Lead said that Dickinson ‘has been hugely influential in how we best manage our swimmers’ respiratory health and in educating both myself as well as the coaches and athletes \[…\] helping us developing a programme to re\-train’; and that ‘everything that \[they\] now do has evolved from the work we’ve done with John \[Dickinson\] over the last number of years’ **\[e\]**. Similarly, a member of the GB Swimming Team noted that she ‘definitely wouldn’t be in as good a place as \[she is\] today without seeing John Dickinson and getting the help from him’; that she is ‘racing a lot better and finding breathing in the pool a lot easier’; and that ‘all the help and feedback \[she\] got from John Dickinson \[she will\] definitely use for the rest of \[her\] career’ **\[e\]**. Furthermore, as a result of such improvements, the team’s Chief Medical Officer identified that since **2018** the team have endorsed the therapy and management practices they have learned from Dickinson throughout their feeder squads across England and Wales Swimming **\[d\]**. 

-  In **2018** the England Men’s Football Team adopted respiratory screening for their players ahead of the 2018 World Cup for the first time, as a result of collaboration with Dickinson **\[f\]**. The Team’s Lead Performance Doctor emphasised that: ‘as a direct consequence of this research \[ **R2**\], we have worked directly with \[Dickinson\] in the build up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia to ensure those players requiring therapy are using it appropriately and their airway health is optimised’ **\[f\]**. The Lead Performance Doctor endorsed the benefits of this change of practice by stating that the team have ‘benefitted by some of the players with EIB receiving a secure up\-to\-date diagnosis, which we have been able to act on ensure their inhaler therapy is optimised’ **\[f\]**. 

-  In the build\-up to the Tokyo 2021 Summer Olympic Games, Dickinson delivered consultancy and workshops to practitioners working within GB Cycling, based on his research into providing appropriate respiratory care for elite athletes **\[R1, R2\]**. The Head of Medical Services at GB Cycling commented: ‘through application of the learning and knowledge we acquired in the workshop and from Dr. Dickinson, our team have developed and delivered new protocols \[…\] to better support our riders – new methods that have resulted in riders reporting less respiratory symptoms during training and improved their preparation for the upcoming Olympics’ **\[h\]**. 

 **Informing the Management of Respiratory Care and Best Practice** 

 Through the Respiratory Clinic, Dickinson works extensively with a number of national and international sports governing bodies, including USA Cycling, England Rugby Union, and Swim Ireland, sharing research findings to inform respiratory care and practice. For example, the Director of Athlete Health for the English Institute of Sport \(EIS\) – which works with sports science and medicine practitioners across over 35 Olympic and Paralympic sports – said that as a direct consequence of the Clinic’s research and collaboration since **2018** they have ‘offer\[ed\] diagnostic assessments for athletes within the EIS system to ensure \[they\] are addressing their respiratory health and providing appropriate management’ **\[g\]**. 

 In **2018**, the Clinic was commissioned by the EIS to collaborate on a £800,000 project investigating respiratory health and acute airway infection, founded on the Clinic’s respiratory care management principles and techniques. The EIS reported that they: ‘valued \[Dickinson’s\] input into \[its\] design and operation that is contributing to the improved management and understanding of respiratory illness, the leading cause of restricted athlete availability for preparation and performance’ **\[g\]**. 

 As evidence of the reach of the impact of his research, internationally based Sports Medicine clinics have sought Dickinson’s advice to deliver similar Respiratory Clinic services \(e.g. Norway, Qatar\). For example, the pulmonary laboratory at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences is used to treat and diagnose Norwegian national team athletes, and through collaboration with them ‘Dr Dickinson’s research, clinical experience and research\-based advice has informed the development of practices across Norway for the improvement of \[their\] athletes’ respiratory health and performance as they prepare for the World championships and the next summer and winter Olympics’ **\[i\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Import tariffs in Argentina are amongst the highest in the world. Barely changed since 1995, they have prevented the country benefitting from globalisation. Building on insights and methods from his research, Dr Juan Carluccio developed a proposal for import\-tariff reform that impacted policy\-making in Argentina through three channels: 1\) negotiations to revise the Common External Tariff \(CET\) of MERCOSUR, a trading bloc composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, resulting in savings of £100m per year for firms, 2\) unilateral tariff reductions producing savings of over £50m per year, and 3\) negotiations of trade agreements between the EU and MERCOSUR leading to one of the world’s biggest free trade areas. These key components of the country’s “intelligent integration” strategy impacted all firms, consumers and workers in Argentina and MERCOSUR. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2013, Carluccio’s research at the University of Surrey has focused on understanding how imports affect firms, workers and consumers. His research offers new theoretical insights and novel empirical measures utilising large datasets of imports, exports, firm production and wages. 

 Throughout the rest of the narrative, the terms “inputs” and “intermediate goods” will be used interchangeably to denote goods used in the production process of other goods, as opposed to final consumption. As an example, steel and iron are intermediate goods for the production of cars, with cars being final consumption products. 

 Reducing trade barriers makes imported goods cheaper, benefitting both firms and consumers. 

###  Intermediate goods imports increase firm productivity, wages, and demand for skilled workers 

 Carluccio analysed firms’ decisions to import intermediate goods and their impacts on productivity and employment. Firms react to reductions in trade barriers by moving the most unskilled intensive parts of the production process \(e.g., assembly lines\) to low\-wage countries, and concentrate their activities on tasks undertaken by skilled workers, such as marketing and product design. Consequently, productivity of importing firms increases, and their employment becomes more biased towards skilled workers. A key insight of the research is that the impact of tariff reductions is felt primarily by the largest firms because only larger firms can afford offshoring costs, such as searching for suppliers in foreign countries **\[3.1\]**. Carluccio’s work includes original empirical measures of the importance of unskilled labour in the production of imported products \(“labour\-intensity”\). 

 Offshoring affects wages. Carluccio’s work showed that increases in firms’ imports of intermediate goods are associated with higher average wages, consistent with the theoretical idea that offshoring raises firm productivity. However, productivity and wage gains accrue solely to skilled workers, such as technicians and executives, and have nil effects on blue\-collar workers who are more easily substituted for foreign labour **\[3.2\]**. 

 Carluccio studied the wage consequences of the integration of emerging economies \(such as China\) into global value chains, which manifest themselves as imports of intermediate goods into high\- and middle\-income economies. The research showed that such integration increases wages of emerging\-economy workers while generating wage inequalities in importing developed economies, raising skilled workers’ wages, but decreasing those of unskilled workers, in line with evidence discussed above **\[3.2 and 3.3\]**. 

 Furthermore, institutions in a host country affect offshoring strategies. Carluccio shows, both theoretically and empirically, that when firms import from countries where worker bargaining power is strong, they prefer to subcontract to independent suppliers \(“outsourcing”\) instead of building their own factories, with consequences for wages and productivity **\[3.4\]**. 

###  Imports of consumer goods reduces the cost of living for local consumers 

 Reduction in consumer prices are the other side of the globalisation ‘coin’. Carluccio provided one of the first quantifications of the impact of imports on consumer prices, developing an original methodology and applying it to detailed data on imports by product and country of origin **\[3.5\]**. 

###  Research on economic policy\-making in Argentina 

 As well as analysing the European experience, Carluccio studied trade policies in Argentina and discussed the effect of the strongly protectionist measures undertaken during 2011\-2015 on the performance of the economy **\[3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Achieving “intelligent insertion into the world” was a key objective of Argentina’s government during Mauricio Macri’s Presidency \(December 2015 – December 2019\) **\[5.1a\]**, which took office after over a decade of economic isolation **\[3.6\]**. At the heart of this objective was import\-tariff reform to allow local firms’ participation in global value chains and to reap the opportunities provided by globaliszed production **\[5.1b\]**. 

 Carluccio worked in Argentina from April 2018 to April 2019 as Director of Research with the National Foreign Trade Commission \- *Comision Nacional de Comercio Exterior*, \(CNCE\), alongside local economists, transferring knowledge and capabilities gathered during his extensive experience as an academic. His research conducted at the University of Surrey was decisive in the decision by the Ministry of Production and Labour of Argentina to appoint him **\[5.2a\]** and charge him with developing a proposal for a thorough reform of import tariffs. The President of the CNCE stated “ *I proposed the authorities that Juan Carluccio join our research unit under the belief that the state\-of\-the art ideas developed in his academic works would materialize in sound applied research with strong impact in the decision\-making process”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 Argentina is part of MERCOSUR, a trading bloc where Common External Tariffs \(CET\) apply to goods imported from third countries. MERCOSUR tariffs had remained unchanged since 1995 and were amongst the world’s highest **\[5.4\]**. Reforming the CET required consensus by all members. Individual countries are allowed to unilaterally change tariffs of a limited set of products \(100 in the case of Argentina\) via the ‘Lists of Exceptions to the CET’. 

 The decision process for tariff changes in the Ministry for Production and Labour of Argentina is composed of three steps. In a first step, technical teams within the International Trade Secretariat provide recommendations based on economic and data analysis. These proposals are then presented to high\-rank officials, and eventually to the Secretary and Minister who make the final decisions **\[5.3\]**. In the case of unilateral decisions, the process requires a Decree implementing the changes. In the case of MERCOSUR’s common tariffs, Argentine representatives propose changes to the bloc’s members and, if consensus is reached, changes are made effective through MERCOSUR Resolutions. 

###  Establishing the foundations for tariff reforms 

 Carluccio first developed a study of the tariff structure of Argentina and MERCOSUR, drawing on his research **\[3.1\-3.6\]**. The study, consolidated in an official government White Paper **\[5.4\]**, contains a general diagnosis and priorities to guide reform. Products were grouped according to their position in the value chain, following concepts and data\-analysis methods developed by Carluccio **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.5\]**. Tariffs were compared to international standards, and the implications of the tariffs for productivity and competitiveness were explained. High tariffs for intermediate goods are highlighted as particularly harmful because these goods represent a large share of production costs **\[3.1\]**. 

 The diagnosis highlighted the abnormally high levels of tariffs in Argentina \(four times higher than international averages\), and identified high tariffs applied to intermediate goods as the key deficiency of the tariff structure. Importantly, the White Paper **\[5.4\]**, stresses that high input tariffs hinder the expected beneficial effects of free\-trade agreements, thus emphasising the need for a coherent approach to trade openness **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.5\]**. 

 The diagnosis and policy recommendations from Carluccio’s White Paper garnered consensus amongst senior officers following presentations to the Minister of Production and Labour and various State Secretaries, Under\-secretaries and mid\-rank officials with policy\-making influence. The Trade Under\-secretary stated: “ *The messages of this research gathered consensus among senior policy\-makers and were influential in highlighting the need to modernise the structure of tariff protection in MERCOSUR, as well as the priorities that should guide the reforms*” **\[5.5\]**. The Economic Policy Secretary stated in March 2019 that Carluccio’s work “ *is currently gaining consensus within our administration, evidenced by the fact that he presented his recommendations to me on behalf of the Secretary of International Trade in my capacity of Secretary of Economic Policy*” **\[5.6\]**. 

###  Impact on tariff change decisions by Argentina’s and MERCOSUR’s authorities 

 Impacting policy\-making in Argentina through three channels: 

### 1.  Revision of MERCOSUR’s Common External Tariff \(CET\). 

 Senior officers’ consensus around the diagnoses and recommendations resulted in Carluccio being tasked with elaborating a detailed tariff\-reform proposal for around 10,000 products in the MERCOSUR product classification \(NCM\), by directing a team of specialists in different sectors of the economy. This work impacted the decision\-making process in two instances. In late 2018, it led to the decision by MERCOSUR to reduce tariffs for 49 inputs used in the chemicals sector **\[5.1d, 5.8b\]**. The average tariff for these goods was reduced from 10% to 2%, implying estimated yearly savings of over £100m in tariff costs for firms in the industry **\[5.11a\]**. In early 2019 a cross\-country expert group with Member States representatives was instructed to study and revise the CET under the conviction that it is “ *fundamental for the consolidation of the Customs Union*” and that the tariff structure has to “ *promote competitiveness and productivity in the region*” **\[5.1c\]**, **\[5.7a**, **5.7b**, **5.7c**, **5.7d**, **5.8a\]**. The proposals from Carluccio and his team represented the position of Argentina in the negotiations. The International Trade Secretary stated it “ *serves as the basis of our country´s position in talks with MERCOSUR partners, guides senior officials in the process of negotiating in our country´s best interest, and provides a lens for the study of our partners´ positions in the talks*” **\[5.9\]**. 

### 1.  Unilateral tariff reductions 

 The research influenced the programme of unilateral tariff reductions. The officer in charge, Under\-secretary for Trade Facilitation, stated: “ *I have devoted strong efforts to the optimization of the exception lists. This work requires to be grounded in a general strategy to ensure that the decisions maximize the potential impact of tariffs on the economy*” and that Carluccio’s work was “ *very valuable, as it has helped organizing priorities, optimizing our strategy and communicating the decisions convincingly to both the authorities in the Ministry and representatives of the private sector”* **\[5.10\]**. The implementation of the strategy resulted in concrete measures, notably the reduction of tariffs for 10 key intermediate goods widely used in the textile, apparel, steel, paintings and bicycle sectors **\[5.1e\]**, **\[5.7e\]**. Tariffs were reduced from an average of 19% to an average of 5%, generating estimated yearly savings of over £53m for firms in highly employment\-intensive sectors **\[5.11b\]**. This was achieved with no damage to local workers because goods were selected for having nil or little local production, as research had shown that trade liberalisation can hurt employment and wages of the less\-skilled **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. 

### 1.  Negotiations of trade agreements with external countries and trading blocs 

 Carluccio’s work influenced Argentina's position in negotiations between MERCOSUR and other trading blocs, notably the EU\-MERCOSUR free\-trade deal, for which an agreement in principle was signed in June 2019 after 20 years of negotiations, paving the way for the creation of the world’s biggest free trade area **\[5.1f\]** \(an agreement ‘in substance’ with the European Free Trade Area \(EFTA\) was reached in August 2019 and negotiations with Canada are underway\). The Economic Policy Secretary \(and former Secretary of Commerce\) affirmed that Carluccio’s research provided theoretical and empirical evidence that guided the negotiations: “ *The research highlighted that a reform of the tariff structure was essential to succeed in our main objective of achieving the “intelligent” integration of the Argentine economy into the world, a pillar of which is the signing of free trade agreements”* **\[5.6\]**, and the International Trade Undersecretary noted that “ *the research informed the process of trade agreement negotiations, on the one hand, by highlighting the kind of tariffs reforms necessary to achieve successful integration via free trade agreements and, on the other, by providing guidelines for the determination of our country´s offers in the negotiations.”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 The overall nature of the impact is summarised by the Economic Policy Secretary, who stated that Carluccio’s work in Argentina allowed him to “ *bridge between the theoretical ideas, concepts and empirical methods developed in his academic research and the particular cases of our country and MERCOSUR, enhancing our policy\-making <…> and shaping the direction of fundamental reforms”* **\[5.6\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Based on research led by Professor Susan Durbin at UWE, a women’s mentoring scheme \(‘alta’\) was developed and implemented across the UK aviation and aerospace industry to address the under\-representation of women in professional roles, in the context of a chronic industry skills shortage. The first scheme of its kind operating in the industry, alta has been embedded within the Royal Aeronautical Society’s \(RAeS\) careers service to meet its commitment to achieving gender equality. Alta is part of the mentoring ‘offer’ and has been adopted by companies such as Airbus, GKN and Collins Aerospace. It has seen over 400 women sign up as mentors and mentees across the industry, with more than 100 since the start of the Covid\-19 pandemic. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 This case study is underpinned by research led by Professor Susan Durbin and supported by Dr Ana Lopes and Stella Warren, between November 2014 and November 2015 at the University of the West of England \(UWE\). The research was funded by the ESRC Knowledge Exchange Fund \(GBP64,861\) \( **G1**\), with an additional contribution of GBP16,000 from UWE. The industry partners match funded this with a contribution of GBP80,000 through both financial and in\-kind contributions. 

 The research sought to address the persistent and chronic skills shortage, and under\-representation of women in the industry. Women comprise just 4% of pilots and 10% of engineers and hold a paucity of leadership positions \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\). The underpinning research led to the design and launch of an on\-line, industry\-wide mentoring scheme for women. It included the development of algorithms to match female professional mentors and mentees in the industry via an on\-line platform. 

 Research was designed to identify current provision, levels of need, and to support the design of appropriate interventions. During 2015, a survey, interviews and focus groups with *circa* 250 professional women, employers and HR directors, were conducted across the industry. At this time, none of the founding partners \(Airbus, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Aeronautical Society \(RAeS\) or industry employers, specifically provided mentoring support for professional women. As a result, a mentoring scheme was designed, based upon women’s and employers’ expressed needs for mentoring support. 

 The research explored some of the frustrations, limitations and challenges women experienced in the industry whilst building their careers \( **R4**, **R5**\). This included a lack of access to mentors, especially female mentors, who could guide less experienced women through their career challenges, become a source of advice and support, and share experiences; especially women who had maintained their careers after having families \( **R6**\) **.** Findings indicated that an industry\-wide focus would be especially attractive to women, as this would enable them to connect with women outside of their own organisations. The research revealed that mentoring was not available to the majority of women and that there was a need for a women\-only mentoring scheme. The research discovered that informal mentoring was more common but this tended to be *ad hoc*, more available to senior women, and not sufficient for structured career mentoring. Mentoring was seen as especially valuable to women because it could help with issues that specifically impact women, such as maternity leave and return to work, work\-life balance and childcare issues.  [Alta](https://alta.onpld.com/) was ultimately designed as an on\-line mentoring platform which ensured that the mentoring scheme was as widely available as possible to women across the industry. This also sought to improve women’s representation whilst addressing gender inequalities. 

 Designing the research in this way was a unique approach, fully supported by the founding partners, industry employers and the women we contacted across the industry. The persistent problem of the under\-representation of women and the opportunity to develop a potential solution through working with academia, gave the project a sense of urgency. It also demonstrated that the women who represented the founding partners were personally committed to increasing gender equality in their organisations. 

 The organisations themselves become involved, as there was a clear business case to recruit and retain more women in an industry with a chronic skills shortage. This was recognised as a shared industry problem that would entail a shared response \( **R1**\) **.** 

 A key finding was the need to incorporate mentoring training into alta. This was considered to be vital, leading to the design and launch of a bespoke and distinctive training package. The data highlighted the importance of appropriately matching mentors and mentees. This led to a prolonged piece of work on the design of bespoke mentor and mentee matching questions, jointly produced by UWE researchers and the founding partners, and built in to the algorithm for matching. The research reflected the initial design of alta from the participant perspective \( **R1**, **R2**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 According to industry leaders, the alta mentoring scheme, derived from UWE research, has brought about significant change in aviation and aerospace industry practice. It is, ‘ *the only industry\-wide, women\-to\-women mentoring scheme of its kind, anywhere in the world’* \( **S1**\). Alta is bringing together competitor companies who have joined forces to offer otherwise scarce mentoring support to their female professionals through building a network that is industry wide and has become ‘ *a significant influencer for culture change in the aviation industry*’ \( **S2**\). 

 **Impact on the industry, the professional body \(RAeS\) and employers** 

 The professional body, the Royal Aeronautical Society \(RAeS\) represents corporations of all sizes across the industry. After witnessing a lack of progress over the past 20\-30 years, and its role as a 'thought leader' in this area, in 2016 it committed GBP50,000 towards promoting gender diversity and brought alta in\-house, embedding it into its careers service and web page publications \( **S3**, **S4**\). Alta represented the RAeS commitment to the Women in Aviation and Aerospace Charter for gender equality \( **S5**\). Prior to alta, there was no mentoring support available to RAeS female members or as part of its careers service \( **S4**\). 

 A number of high\-profile employers have made financial contributions to support alta events \(the RAeS, Airbus, Collins Aerospace, GKN, Boeing\). There has been business collaboration, sharing of best practice and development of in\-house support schemes for women professionals building on alta.  Alta is becoming strategically significant within the industry and plays a key role in making the business case for gender diversity amongst aerospace organisations. Industry feedback indicates that it is: 

 *‘putting in place a mechanism that complements internal mentoring schemes, recruitment and retention processes and career progression opportunities’* \( **S1**\). 

 One industry insider noted that for the first time a global study \(2019’s *Soaring Through the Glass Ceiling*\) had been released which validates the data behind the need for women to be in leadership positions and also endorses the need for formal and informal mentoring \( **S1**\). 

 Airbus, one of the most significant employers in the industry, was involved in alta from the beginning \(as a founding partner\), helping to over\-see its pilot phase. It promoted alta as a support platform via the Aerospace Growth Partnership \(AGP\), an advisory group backed by industry and the government on aviation and aerospace \( **S6**\). The AGP identified alta as a key tool to maintaining and growing the industry’s skills and capability. 

 Building on alta, the in\-house Airbus Women’s Network went from being a UK scheme to a global, multi\-national company\-wide initiative. Airbus sees alta at the forefront of organisational culture change *:* 

 *‘It has forced the industry to have a debate about why a women only mentoring scheme was needed in the first place with the topic no longer seen as taboo’* \( **S6**\). 

 **Impact on alta mentors and mentees** 

 Alta has made a significant contribution in enabling professional women to access mentoring support that would otherwise not have been available to them. It has enabled women to support one another when such support for women in male dominated industries is scarce \( **S7**\). The on\-line nature of alta has also enabled women to come together irrespective of location and has ‘ *created a community of women in an industry of men’* \( **S6**\) **.** 

 From the beginning, a growing critical mass of women became involved in the design of alta, emphasising its grounding in research and evidence base and its ability to address the expressed mentoring and support needs not previously available to women: 

 *‘It has given women a safe space to speak to other like\-minded women who have had similar experiences and share concerns’* \( **S7**\) **.** 

 By the end of 2020, only 18 months after its official launch on International Women’s Day 2019, 460 individual female mentors and mentees, from a range of organisations in the industry, had joined alta. The majority of mentors are executive/board members, senior managers, squadron leaders and middle managers, indicating high\-level support from more experienced women in the industry. Alta is also seen as a means by which women could step forward and become mentors to women who most need their experience and support **.** 

 This membership is predicted to grow significantly and globally: 

 ‘*The fact that the RAeS is an international membership organisation means women anywhere in the world can access alta, thereby giving it a global reach and also providing the potential for the replication of the model across the world*’ \( **S1**\). 

 Sixty women have joined as mentors, over 300 as mentees, with almost 100 joining as both, representing organisations from within the industry, both within and outside the UK \( **S8**\). The Civil Aviation Authority, Rolls Royce, Collins Aerospace, Babcock and Airbus UK are alta’s five largest contributors. Other notable users of alta include: Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Safran Landings System, the RAF, Airbus China, Boeing UK, Eurowings, Gatwick Airport, Sydney Metro Airports, easyJet, Virgin Atlantic, Qatar Airways, Cathay Pacific and the Met Police \( **S8**\). 

 From the mentee perspective, alta has given women a ‘voice’ and the confidence to seek support from other women in their industry \( **S3**\). It is a vehicle to share experiences and mutual support and a platform for members to be vocal about the challenges they are facing, as well as being seen by organisations as a retention and recruitment tool. Alta's approach is based on the concept of ‘empowerment’, its aim being to raise women's levels of confidence and self\-esteem. By enabling female professionals to share experiences, alta has sought to break down isolation and enable women to actively develop networks. As one mentee commented: 

 ‘*my journey within the aerospace industry has been challenging. In this respect, alta has been invaluable and confidence boosting’* \( **S9**\). 

 The majority of women also expressed a preference for a female mentor who could offer ‘high value’ mentoring that cannot be achieved through formal training. Another mentee commented on the significant value of: 

 *‘having the benefit of an independent female who may have trodden the path before you and can support you in negotiating the challenges and opportunities of professional life’* \( **S10**\). 

 **Alta and Covid\-19** 

 As a blended face\-to\-face/on\-line mentoring platform, alta has become especially important in the current Covid\-19 crisis. The scheme transcends organisational and geographical boundaries, making it widely accessible and of continuing and increased benefit to women in the industry \( **S11**\). The value of on\-line mentoring has never been so vital, with mentors able to offer help to those women who may be feeling isolated \(many women have been working from home, or have been furloughed or made redundant\). 

 Since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, over 100 new mentors/mentees have joined alta: 

 *‘The online support, help with imaginative thinking around career choices and options and harnessing the power of the network has played a crucial role in supporting women in the industry during the pandemic’* \( **S2**\). 

 One industry expert and alta mentor, with over thirty years’ experience in securing large scale aerospace funding, and a current advisor to local and national government agencies, concluded that: 

 *‘after years of well\-intentioned but limited impact initiatives, the aerospace and aviation community is embracing gender equality initiatives, within a broader drive to improve diversity and inclusion. Alta is, without doubt, an instrumental aspect of this journey’* \( **S1**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Cambridge research has played a fundamental role in the control of HIV by developing tools to enable monitoring of infection in the population worldwide, informing the design of disease control strategies, and evaluating what works. Cambridge approaches have been adopted by Public Health England, the European Centre for Disease Control, and other international bodies as their methods of choice. These approaches have contributed to improvements in the quality and quantity of life for thousands of HIV\-infected individuals and reduced HIV spread, helping to place the UK on track to eliminate transmission of HIV by 2030.

 Strategy to control a global epidemic: early diagnosis and early treatment 

 There is no cure or vaccine for HIV, a global epidemic that has so far infected 76 million people, killed 33 million people, and cost the global economy hundreds of billions of pounds. A key disease control strategy involves early HIV diagnosis and lifelong use of highly effective anti\-viral medicines. This approach demonstrably reduces viral transmission, prevents illness, and prolongs life \( *Lancet* 2013\). However, its success depends on being able to reliably monitor HIV rates in the population, identify high\-risk groups, and design and evaluate strategies to reduce transmission. 

 Challenges of monitoring HIV in populations 

 The monitoring of HIV poses significant challenges because the infection often remains undetected due to its long incubation period. This means that it is impossible to directly measure key quantities that are essential to disease control, such as prevalence \(the number of people infected\), incidence \(the number of new infections\), and numbers of undiagnosed infections. Relevant information that could be used to indirectly estimate these quantities exists – but it is imperfect. It is typically affected by biases and is scattered across many disparate sources, such as registers from sexual health clinics, surveys and expert beliefs. If the available information is naïvely combined, without attention to the strengths and weaknesses of the different data sources, the results can be misleading. 

 Research led by the Medical Research Council Biostatistics Unit \(MRC\-BSU\) at the University of Cambridge has addressed these challenges. The Cambridge team has developed new statistical approaches that combine different data sources and account for the uncertainties and limitations that affect each source. The tools that the team has produced inform infection control strategies by enabling the monitoring needed to make them effective, and by generating evidence that these strategies improve quality of life, prevent illness, prolong life, and save money. 

 Producing robust methods and tools for evidence\-based strategic decisions for HIV disease control 

 Since the early 2000s, Cambridge researchers have developed surveillance tools that enable tracking of HIV in the population. The methods are based on Bayesian statistical models \[1,2\] that allow judicious combination of multiple different sources of current and prior knowledge through formal statistical “triangulation”. This approach to estimating prevalence and incidence is particularly important in a field like HIV, where a wide range of data sources exists, but each data source has known limitations and biases. Through use of Bayesian methods, the tools make it possible to formally account for these limitations and to correct for biases by incorporating additional information from other datasets or from expert opinion. 

 The first tool, the **Multi\-Parameter Evidence Synthesis \(MPES\)** \[1,3,4\] model, triangulates 11 current datasets, including routinely collected data on the numbers of people living with diagnosed HIV, records from sexual health screening, and information from community surveys, with evidence from previous studies, to estimate HIV prevalence. 

 The second tool is a **“back\-calculation” approach** \[2,5–7\] which combines data on new diagnoses and information on HIV disease progression to statistically reconstruct the hidden infection process underlying these observed data and to estimate the number of new infections over time \[2\]. 

 For over a decade, joint work between MRC\-BSU and the government’s public health agencies has resulted in regular assessments of the state of the HIV epidemic, published yearly in official Public Health England reports and used to inform policies. Cambridge research has been key in evaluating HIV control strategies, for example showing that they are associated with substantial falls in infection rates, number of late diagnoses, and undiagnosed infections \[4,7\].

 Controlling HIV through evidence\-based prevention and control strategies 

 HIV is among the deadliest and costliest global epidemics of the past half\-century. Around 76 million people around the world have been infected, including 33 million people who have died. An estimated 38 million people currently live with HIV globally, including seven million who are unaware they have the infection \(UNAIDS statistics\). In the UK, about 100,000 people are living with HIV, with high concentrations among men who have sex with men and among black African populations \[A\]. Between 2000 and 2015, the HIV epidemic was estimated to cost the global economy over USD550 billion \(Lancet 2018\). 

 For more than a decade, researchers in Cambridge and at Public Health England \(PHE\) \(and its predecessor organisations\) have worked closely together to develop and deliver evidence\-based approaches to support control strategies for HIV \[1–5,7\]. The approaches – involving intensification of prevention policies over time, informed by the estimates resulting from the Cambridge methods – have been associated with reductions in HIV transmission and in undiagnosed infections and late diagnoses. They have helped cut infection rates, with numbers of undiagnosed infections reduced by thousands in England alone. 

 Adopted by the UK and other governments, these approaches are essential to the tracking of HIV in populations, the development and implementation of strategies to reduce HIV spread, and the rapid evaluation of those strategies – all activities that are fundamental to disease control. Cambridge research has therefore contributed significantly to the remarkable improvements seen in the quality and quantity of life for thousands of HIV\-infected individuals, to reductions in HIV transmission, and to savings in healthcare costs, placing the UK on track to eliminate transmission of HIV by 2030 \[A\]. 

 Widespread adoption of Cambridge tools and estimates in the UK and internationally 

 Public Health England \[A–C\] has adopted the Cambridge techniques as the official methods for estimating HIV prevalence and incidence. Annual estimation of HIV prevalence in the UK has, since 2005, been based on the Cambridge Multi\-Parameter Evidence Synthesis \(MPES\) approach. The Cambridge back\-calculation method has provided incidence estimates since 2012. Both these estimates have been used by PHE to underpin its strategy, policy and practice recommendations \[C\], becoming an *“essential component of PHE annual reports”* and *“the national yardstick to measure progress”* in controlling HIV \[B\]. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) on increasing HIV testing uptake \(2016\) \[D\], and the British HIV Association UK National Guidelines for HIV Testing \(2015, 2017 and 2020\) \[D\], also endorse the Cambridge methods. Internationally, several European governments and agencies have adopted the Cambridge approaches, for example those using the recommended modelling tool of the European Centre for Disease Control, an agency of the European Union \(including from Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Slovenia\) \[6,E\]. 

 A further far\-reaching international impact has been through **Fast\-Track Cities** \[F\], a global initiative involving hundreds of millions of people and 300 major cities around the world, led by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS \(UNAIDS\), the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care, and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme \(UN\-Habitat\). Cambridge’s research plays a crucial role in this initiative by informing the targets and monitoring progress towards them, particularly in relation to UNAIDS’ 90\-90\-90 targets: that 90% of people living with HIV should know their HIV status; 90% of people with diagnosed HIV infection should receive antiretroviral therapy; and 90% of people receiving therapy should have sustained viral suppression. Analysis based on Cambridge methods has shown that the **UK met the 90\-90\-90 target in 2016** \[G\], while London has exceeded the new 95\-95\-95 target \[F\]. 

 Providing evidence for HIV prevention strategies 

 Evidence produced using tools developed by the Cambridge team has been crucial in **establishing the effectiveness of HIV prevention strategies** and providing the basis for policy intervention. Cambridge evidence was, for example, a key part of PHE’s written submission to the House of Commons Select Committee on Health and Social Care’s Report on Sexual Health in 2019 \[H\], used to support the approach of increasing HIV testing and early HIV treatment as prevention. 

 Since 2010, Cambridge estimates of undiagnosed HIV infections have **underpinned multiple high\-profile initiatives in the UK to increase testing**. Examples include the Terrence Higgins Trust’s “It Starts with Me” campaign \[I\], the National HIV Prevention Programme for England \[I\], and the “Halve It” campaign, a coalition of organisations – including NICE, the Department of Health and Social Care, and the Local Government Association – working with the House of Commons All\-Party Parliamentary Group on HIV/AIDS to halve the proportion of undiagnosed infections by 2020 \[I\]. 

 Guided by information derived through Cambridge’s tools, these campaigns play a major role each year in public health initiatives, such as National HIV Testing Week. The success of these initiatives is evidenced by figures derived using Cambridge’s methods, which show a **progressive decrease in** **the number of undiagnosed infections among gay and bisexual men**, which has halved from around 8000 in 2008 to around 4000 in 2018 \[A\]. Regular application of the back\-calculation approach has shown that the **infection rate in gay and bisexual men has fallen steadily** \[A\] \(from around 2800 in 2012 to around 800 in 2018 – a reduction of over two thirds\), with a steep fall in incidence in younger men. 

 There has also been a steady **decline in the numbers of people receiving late diagnoses of HIV** in the UK, decreasing from 1,861 in 2015 to 1,279 in 2019 \[J\]. Late \(CD4 count <350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>\) and very late \(CD4 count <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>\) diagnosis of HIV is the most powerful predictor of mortality in infected people. The UK’s downward trend in late diagnoses \[7\] is therefore very important for health outcomes among those who are infected. 

 Using PHE data \[K\], it is possible to show what would have happened without intensified prevention after 2010. Assuming that the proportion of very late diagnoses remained constant over time at the level observed in 2010 \(28%\), an expected \(counterfactual\) number of very late diagnoses can be derived \(Table 1\). This suggests that **around 1100 very late diagnoses were averted over the period 2014\-18.** From these figures, **a cost saving of over GBP4 million per year can also be estimated**. This cost is calculated as the difference between the respective yearly costs of GBP7.1 million and GBP3.1 million of very late and \(comparatively\) early diagnoses \(Table 2\). This offers an approximation of the economic impact of the policies fueled by Cambridge research.

 Supporting bold, ambitious policies to eliminate HIV 

 The body of work from Cambridge and its collaborators, including PHE, has been highly influential in supporting policy\-makers in the shift from a traditional containment strategy to a much bolder strategy of eliminating HIV altogether, particularly since the introduction of UNAIDS’ 90\-90\-90 target in 2016. Led by the evidence produced by Cambridge and the ability to monitor infections effectively, **policies set out by the Department of Health and Social Care now focus on eliminating, not just controlling, HIV** \[A\]. 

 Cambridge work was used by the Department of Health and Social Care in its decision to establish an independent HIV Commission in 2019 \[L\], whose remit is to find ambitious and achievable ways to end new HIV transmissions and HIV\-attributed deaths in England by 2030. In 2019, PHE cited Cambridge research, methods, tools and estimates \[L\] in its submission to the Commission. 

 The HIV Commission’s report, published in December 2020 \[L\], set an interim target of reducing transmission by 80% by 2025. The Cambridge back\-calculation estimates were used in the report to show the decline in new infections. The importance of monitoring transmission by estimating incidence is highlighted in the report’s recommendation that *“everyone serious about ending new transmissions must track our progress against estimated incidence of HIV, not new diagnoses alone*.” 

 The report also made use of Cambridge estimates of undiagnosed prevalence from Public Health England’s latest annual report, including the key headline: “ *The message from the HIV Commission is ‘test, test, test’. To find the estimated 5,900 undiagnosed people living with HIV in England, HIV testing must be normalised throughout the health service. Everyone should know their HIV status*” \[L\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 International consensus recognizes the need to strengthen generalist medicine within modern health systems. However, there is no commonly agreed account of excellence in general practice. Professor Quassim Cassam has used his research on professional virtues and vices to develop an innovative practice\-focused model of excellence in UK general practice which has been influencing established and trainee GPs since 2016. Underpinned by his theory of generalist excellence, Professor Cassam’s free online toolkit is lending qualified and trainee GPs the tools with which to cultivate their practice and encourage personal reflection and resilience in an increasingly pressurised and target\-driven healthcare system. The toolkit has since been adapted into an eLearning module by the Royal College of General Practitioners. These resources, along with bespoke workshops and training sessions, are positioning Professor Cassam as a leading source of authority for the GP community on enabling excellence in generalist medicine. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Cassam’s research since 2016 has focused on epistemic *virtues* and *vices*. This research was funded in part by an AHRC Leadership Fellowship and resulted in a book, *Vices of the Mind: From the Intellectual to the Political* \( **3.1**\). In this work he proposes that epistemic vices \(e.g. closed\-mindedness, intellectual arrogance, dogmatism\) are personal qualities that systematically obstruct the gaining, keeping or sharing of knowledge. He calls this theory *Obstructivism*. Epistemic virtues \(e.g. intellectual humility, conscientiousness, diligence\), in contrast, are attitudes, traits or ways of thinking that systematically abet the gaining, keeping or sharing of knowledge. 

 He defines professional virtues as those personal qualities that enable members of a given profession to fulfil their professional role to a high standard, to achieve the goals of their profession, and to meet their professional challenges \( **3.4**\). Professional virtues are role\-relative \( **3.1**\). In medicine, identifying the professional virtues of the medical generalist requires an understanding of the nature of medical generalism. 

 Professor Cassam proposes a new theory of medical generalism, based on an original account of its goals, challenges, orientation, ways of working, knowledge and values. He proceeds to identify 10 distinctive virtues of medical generalism: attentiveness, curiosity, lucidity, detachment, humility, resilience, empathy, self\-trust, situational judgement and epistemic justice. He also identifies means by which such virtues can be cultivated \( **3.1\)**. 

 Professor Cassam defines professional vices as personal qualities that obstruct the delivery of excellent generalist care. In his papers 'Stealthy Vices' \( **3.3**\) and 'Diagnostic Error , Overconfidence and Self\-Knowledge' \( **3.2**\), he argues that: \(a\) overconfidence and arrogance are among the professional vices of some members of the medical profession; \(b\) this partly explains relatively high levels of diagnostic error; and \(c\) these vices are stealthy, that is, hidden from the people whose vices they are. Professor Cassam also identifies a category of institutional vices. These are institutional rather than personal obstacles to the delivery of excellent generalist care. Such obstacles include time\-constraints and an over\-emphasis on targets. 

 According to the Royal College of GPs, generalist medicine is person\-centred. Professor Cassam develops a new theory of what person\-centred care is, the professional virtues that facilitate its delivery, and the professional and institutional vices that obstruct its delivery \( **3.4, 3.1, 3.2**\). Person\-centred care involves viewing patients from a second\-person rather than third\-person perspective \(as 'you' rather than 'he' or 'she'\) and as unique particulars rather than mere instances of some general type. 

 The ability to view and treat patients in this way is itself one of the key professional virtues of general practice. In practical terms it involves being willing to engage in a genuine dialogue with patients and to relate to them as individual subjects rather than as biological organisms who happen to have a particular disease or illness. It involves engaging with patients' subjectivity, which in turn requires empathy. These are qualities that can and should be cultivated in general practice \( **3.1, 3.2**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2017 Professor Cassam has developed a strong and unique relationship with the national GP community in the context of his work on excellence in general practice. In so doing, he is impacting GP practice with a view to ultimately enhancing the patient experience. Through his workshops, his participation in GP training and his online toolkit, Professor Cassam's research is changing GPs' understanding of medical generalism and its underpinning excellences. Over 300 GPs and trainee GPs have already benefited from his research throughout the country. As of 31 December 2020, there have been over 2,300 unique visitors to his online toolkit, and in June 2020 the Royal College of GPs \(RCGP\) launched an eLearning module based on Professor Cassam’s research. 

###  Challenging preconceptions: Engaging established GPs with new ideas: 

 Professor Cassam is a pioneer in vice epistemology, a field which he named in 2016 \( **3.5**\). He is one of the first philosophers to have systematically applied philosophical insights about virtues and vices to the understanding of excellence in general practice. An RCGP eLearning module based on his research \( **5.1**\) is described by the College as introducing a set of concepts ‘that will enable healthcare professionals to reflect upon and enhance their practice’. 

 The first stage in achieving the stated impacts involved a workshop for 45 delegates entitled 'Virtues and Vices in Evidence Based Clinical Practice' held at the University of Oxford in January 2016 and organised jointly with Professor Trish Greenhalgh, Professor of Primary Health Care at Oxford \( **5.2**\). This was followed in February 2017 by a workshop for 40 delegates on Professional Vices in Modern Medicine held at the University of Warwick \( **5.3**\). A third event on Professional Virtues in Modern Medicine was held at the University of Warwick in November 2018 \( **5.4**\). 

 Each of these events included senior GPs as speakers, including GP educators and the Vice Chair \(Professional Development\) of the RCGP. The second workshop also featured an acclaimed presentation by Julian Treadwell, the vice\-chair of the Royal College's Overdiagnosis group. Two of the events were addressed by Iona Heath, past President of the Royal College and a world leading authority on the theory and practice of medical generalism. 

 Responses to the feedback questionnaires from these events highlighted the changes in thought and potential for impact on professional practice that the workshops prompted \( **5.5**; **5.6**; **5.7**\).  **The following examples are from practicing GPs:** 

 Question: Has this event inspired you to take any further actions in your professional practice/ place of work? 

 Answers: \(a\) 'More deprescribing'; \(b\) 'Has contributed to the preparation I need to do for my appraisal' \(c\) 'I am planning to feedback on this workshop at a clinical meeting in our practice. I might take the opportunity to provide a session about professional virtues and vices for a GP training session' \(d\) 'Use guidelines even less' \(e\) 'It has affected my practice'. 

 Question: Has this workshop inspired you to take any further actions in your professional practice? 

 Answers \(a\) ‘I would like to take the ideas I got today to my partners and GP trainees’; \(b\) ‘Yes, I want to go back and share with other trainees how important wisdom, patience and ATTENTION are to our role as GPs; \(c\) ‘I will feel vindicated in my decisions to often not do anything overtly “medical” in my consultations; \(d\) ‘Definitely; I am considering a post CCT fellowship to expand my knowledge in this field’; \(e\) ‘Yes, there are lots of things to take back to my everyday consultations’.Question: What one thing will you take away from this workshop? 

 Answers \(a\) 'Over diagnosis and over medication are very complex issues and vices and virtues are one way of examining this complexity'; \(b\) 'To try to build up the self\-esteem of those around me who are arrogant'; \(c\) 'The take home message for me was about the delicate negotiations needed in communicating uncertainty to patients in the context of a caring relationship'; and finally, \(d\) 'Philosophers can help us think more clearly about stuff'\! 

###  Nurturing the future: Educating trainees and their trainers 

 Whilst the workshops were a key first step towards instilling the concepts of vice and virtues into the profession, for such practice to become truly embedded, it is crucial that they are introduced to GPs as early as possible in their careers, particularly as they transition to general practice from the hospital\-based specialist model of medical training. Following the Professional Vices event Professor Cassam was invited to give a one\-day training session at the Wythenshawe Hospital for a large group of ST3 medical students in their final year of postgraduate GP training. The session took place in July 2017 and its success resulted in this becoming an annual event which continues today. Feedback from participants on Professor Cassam’s contribution included: 'Brought a completely different perspective'; 'Useful insight into philosophy and concepts’; 'Clear explanation of philosophical arguments without trying to influence us' \( **5.8**\). 

 Professor Cassam’s work with the RCGP also identified a pressing need for a dedicated web resource giving GPs access to the latest thinking on medical generalism and professional virtues and vices. Professor Cassam’s website \( **3.4**\) is that resource: Professional Virtues in Modern Medicine. This website serves as a free 'go to' resource for GPs to keep up with the latest thinking in this important area and thus enhance their practice. It is becoming increasingly embedded into the national GP community, with over 2,300 unique visitors recorded up to 31 December 2020 \( **5.9**\). Practising GPs and GP trainers have commented: \(a\) ‘As a GP trainer this resource is something that will be really helpful for those entering postgraduate GP training, and one that I will certainly share with my GP trainees and colleagues’ \(b\) ‘a framework for reflecting on what it is we do and those important virtues that contribute to doing the job well’ \(c\) ‘This is a fantastic collection of reflections on generalism, and the virtues and vices thereof…. This resource will help me as a medical educator as I introduce generalists to the deeper implications of their work and the higher order skills and virtues that they will need to cultivate. Thank you’ \( **5.9**\).In June 2020, the RCGP launched a professional development eLearning module based on the content of the website \( **5.1**\). Since then, it has been accessed by 93 unique users \( **5.10**\). As Covid\-19 places an even greater strain on a healthcare system already under extreme pressure, Professor Cassam’s interventions could not be timelier. With social distancing measures now requiring many GPs to undertake consultations by telephone or even through car windows, personal resilience and the ability to convey empathy and humanity to patients in a heightened state of anxiety is crucial to the maintenance of excellent care in challenging circumstances.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In 2015, Neher, Hale and Wang Qi, core members of the University of Nottingham’s China Cultural Visiting Hub \(CCVH\), established the International Creative Economy Leadership Academy to research and deliver international training for creative economy personnel in China, with Neher as Programme Director \(Museums\). China’s cultural sector has experienced an unprecedented increase in the number of new museums, outpacing the development of adequate training for a new workforce of museum professionals. Drawing on strong interdisciplinary research connections in museum studies between the Faculty of Arts and the School of the Built Environment, they created *The Art of Telling Stories,* a responsive Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) programme at UoN Ningbo campus, China, for over 150 museum staff from 17 provinces in China funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(UK Government\) **\(i\)** and the Ningbo Municipal Government **\(ii\)**. Masterclasses drew from Neher’s, Hale’s and Wang Qi’s museum\-focussed research on identity construction and visual and spatial narrative **\(1\-4\)**, embodied spaces **\(5\-6\)**, and curatorial practice **\(3, 7** and **8\)** as an effective way to address the diverse challenges faced by museum professionals in China. The masterclasses were underpinned by new joint research conducted by Neher, Hale and Wang Qi investigating trends and needs in the museum sector. This research focussed on how to engage new audiences in museum exhibitions **\(3\)**, how to deploy new digital technologies with museum audiences **\(4, 5** and **8\)**, and how to design museum spaces with audiences in mind **\(6\)**. The research was deployed in UK projects such as *Leonardo da Vinci: Ten drawings from the Royal Collection* at Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery \(2016\) **\(3\)** and *Dinosaurs of China* at Wollaton Hall, Nottingham \(2017\) **\(7\).** Neher, Hale and Wang Qi brought together complementary subject expertise to solve the problem of how to engage Chinese museum professionals in CPD. 

 Neher's research in art history concerns the visual, spatial, and ritual construction of identity in relation to civic and gender roles and the narrative and symbolic function of images and architectural spaces in producing these roles. Neher argues that objects and images perform a story\-telling function as part of complex visual matrices that are deployed specifically to assert identity, power, and prestige, serving to centre and decentre people, places and groups **\(1,** **2\)**. Neher drew on her research on cultural peripheries in the Italian Renaissance to develop interpretive displays and public programming for the *Leonardo da Vinci: Ten Drawings from the Royal Collection* exhibition at Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery \(2016\). These displays applied lessons from her historical research and trialled curatorial strategies of narrative and spatial decentering. This was achieved by challenging the centrality of the “male genius” in museum interpretation and by disrupting cultural hierarchies through the creation of a public programme that expanded to peripheral non\-arts spaces and utilised social media as an exhibition platform **\(3\)**. Neher subsequently developed this facet of her research on the relationship between exhibition narrative, spaces, and technologies to address the potential of digital technologies to enable visitor\-centred curatorial approaches as another means of decentring cultural hegemonies **\(4\)**. Using a series of digital exhibitions as case studies, including those that marked the quincentennial of Leonardo da Vinci’s death, this research reflects on best practice for combining traditional and innovative approaches to exhibition making. Highlighting a shift away from the museum as a repository of expert\-generated content and a place of authoritative single voice of instruction, Neher interrogated how digital spaces can create extensions to the physical estate of museums, enabling innovative forms of engagement between visitors and collections **\(4\)**. 

 Working alongside Neher in the CCVH and extending Neher’s research on new exhibition engagement techniques, Hale used augmented reality technologies in the design of exhibitions outside museums and identified the important contribution of bodily immersion in real architectural space for the successful creation of engaging and effective museum learning experiences **\(5\)**. This research drew on Hale’s earlier work addressing the role of architectural design in the process of storytelling and interpretation in museums **\(6\).** Wang Qi drew on Neher’s 2016 Leonardo da Vinci project to develop the *Dinosaurs of China* exhibition \(2017\). This project found that specific architectural characteristics of Wollaton Hall, aligned with specific patterns of visitor movement, enhanced the processes of audience understanding and interpretation **\(7\)**. The *Dinosaurs of China* exhibition project drew on Wang Qi’s earlier research on spatial narrative in museum exhibitions which identified that architectural characteristics such as form, materiality and atmosphere, allied to visitor movement, can significantly enhance the processes of informal learning, understanding and interpretation in museums **\(8\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Global to Local: Increasing audience engagement, tourism and increasing the skill base of the staff at Nottingham City Museums and Galleries.** 

 In 2016, the Exhibition Curator for *Leonardo da Vinci: Ten Drawings from the Royal Collection* at Nottingham Castle Museum and Art Gallery “ *sought out Dr Neher’s expertise on the Renaissance period to assist with the interpretation and contextualisation of the artworks for wider public learning, and for a deeper understanding of the life and times of Leonardo*” **\[A\].** Neher’s research on Renaissance identity **\(1, 2\)** and museum engagement strategies **\(3\)** informed the public engagement programme of the exhibition, which led to the Museum reaching new audiences and a change in curatorial approaches following the exhibition. Neher’s research generated new approaches to public engagement, including a Mona Lisa selfie station, which the Exhibition Curator pinpointed as “ *one of the most effective methods to engage visitors with the subject matter and one of the most enjoyed elements of the exhibition*” **\[A\]**, community\-led life drawing, interpretation panels outlining the social history of Leonardo, public talks and articles for *The Conversation* \(with a readership of over 65,000\). Neher’s research brought “ *unprecedented attention to the Castle via social media*” and also informed a new approach to curating and museum interpretation across Nottingham, with the Exhibition Curator commenting that Neher’s research **“** *offered a new perspective on community partnerships and linking to local business that contributed to the overall success of the exhibition, and now encourages me to take more risks and work with new–often diverse \-external partners to increase engagement with subject matter within my own curatorial practice. Looking outside of the ‘gallery walls’ to neighbouring organisations and community groups now informs most of my exhibition planning; with a more relaxed and less institutional attitude, I have implemented and fostered new relationships with holiday accommodation businesses, respite homes and youth groups near Newstead Abbey and Wollaton Hall* **.” \[A\]** 

 Following the success of the collaboration on *Ten Leonardos*, in 2017 Nottingham City Museums and Galleries approached Wang Qi to apply his research on Spatial Narrative principles **\(7, 8\)** to enhance visitor engagement at their blockbuster summer exhibition, *Dinosaurs of China* at Wollaton Hall and following this, for the redevelopment of Wollaton’s galleries. The Museums Development Manager for Nottingham City Council stated that, “ *As a direct result of the exhibition Dinosaurs of China, a four\-year Wollaton Hall Transformation Plan commenced in 2019 to totally re\-design the internal gallery spaces throughout Wollaton Hall, embedding Dr Wang Qi’s ‘Minds\-On Spatial Narrative’ approach at its heart*” **\[B\].** They state that the exhibition concepts developed by Wang Qi “ *have been a catalyst for discussion within the Service at Nottingham City Council regarding the new\-found confidence and ambitions for Wollaton Hall; underpinning the future plans for the Hall to become a centre of excellence for the Natural Sciences and a key venue for international exhibitions*” **\[B\].** Nottingham City Council recognised Wang Qi’s valuable contributions to the cultural life and economy in the city through his positive influence on Nottingham City Council’s vision for its £1.3 million redevelopment of Nottingham Museums and Galleries that began in January 2019 **\[C\].** The Nottingham City Councillor commented that “ *Dinosaurs of China is heralded as a major contributor*” to the increase of 3.4% of the value of tourism in Nottingham in 2017 \(£35.42 million\) **\[C\]**. 

  

 **Local to Global: Informing new audience engagement methods, museum design and sustainable cultural development in the museum sector in China.** 

 Training professionals from nineteen of the twenty\-three regional provinces in China between 2016\-19, the *Telling Stories* programme, developed and delivered by Neher, Hale and Wang Qi, increased the skills and knowledge base in recipient institutions and led to these institutions implementing changes that represent wide\-ranging innovations in the sector. 

  

 **Brise Gallery, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China** 

 After attending two masterclasses in 2015 and 2017, a participant established Brise Gallery – the first international contemporary art gallery in Chengdu. Commenting that research shared in the masterclasses “ *enabled Brise Gallery to become a nationally and internationally significant art space that is crucial to the continued exhibition and consumption of contemporary art in regional China*” **\[D\],** the gallery Director drew from Neher’s expertise on audience engagement through new technological platforms **\(4\)** to create a new Young Artists’ Brand Programme, which enables young artists to act as their own curators, bringing “ *a new perspective to exhibition making that is previously unhear of in Chengdu*” and beginning “ *a trend that will encourage other young artists to innovate and have the freedom to make their own exhibitions in the future in China*.” **\[D\].** The Director asserts that the “ *lessons learnt from the masterclasses enabled Brise Gallery to thrive through adopting an innovative model of operation and as such, the gallery is providing a much needed, local voice as a vehicle to change art consumption patterns in regional contexts*” **\[D\]**. 

 **Paleozoological Museum of China Beijing, Hebei Province, China.** 

 Due to its building being mainly used for research purposes, The Paleozoological Museum of China has faced unique challenges when creating exhibitions of specimens for a general audience. International palaeontologists and curators from the museum attended all iterations of the *Telling Stories* programme 2016\-2019 and applied Wang Qi’s research on spatial exhibition design to their own exhibitions and institutions. The Executive Deputy Director commented that Wang’s spatial narrative principles “ *gave us inspiration about the importance of exhibition space as part of the narrative*” and that the museum implemented Wang Qi’s “ *idea of using the exhibition space to enhance the story and message conducted in the temporary exhibitions we delivered in China, such as ""From Fish to Human"", ""Flying to the Sky"", and “Flying to Cretaceous\-China Pterosaur Exhibition*” \(2017\-19\) **\[E\]**. The Director of the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Paleoanthropology, a research centre that sits within the museum, also attended every iteration of the masterclasses and commented that Wang Qi’s spatial narrative research “ *will become a useful reference for the future development of the Paleozoological Museum of China.*” This museum also used the CPD program as a springboard to develop the *Dinosaurs of China* exhibition in Nottingham and establish a lasting collaborative partnership with Nottingham City Council **\[F\]**. 

 **GreenbergFarrow Architects, Shanghai, China/Wuhan Metro Museum** 

 After attending the *Telling Stories* masterclasses and learning about Hale’s research on embodied engagement **\(5,** **6\)**, GreenbergFarrow Architects \(Shanghai\) approached Hale to embed his research into their design proposal for the new Metro Museum in Wuhan, the largest metro museum in China. The firm were successful and retained by the Wuhan Metro Group and the Chinese government to design the 150,000 square foot museum at a projected cost of $40.8 million **\[G\]**. Hale’s spatial design principals, particularly work on museums as creative mediums, were central to the firm’s success, providing ways to intertwine social, commercial and museum spaces as places for both socialisation and curiosity, allowing the museum to create multiple revenue streams crucial for its sustainability, with Director of GreenbergFarrow China commenting that Hale’s “ *research became a strong influence on the direction and outcome of our conceptual and detailed design for the Wuhan Metro Museum. Your role as museum design consultant during the competition phase gave us a decisive advantage over the other design teams and proved a significant factor in our successfully winning the competition”* **\[H\]**. 

 **Ningbobang Museum, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China** 

 Ningbobang museum is the largest privately\-owned museum in Ningbo dedicated to cultural history and vernacular culture and serves a region of almost 4 million people. Its focus differs from that of most state\-owned museums in the region, which tend to centre on the narratives of key political, military and historical figures. As a result, curators, researchers, exhibitions assistants, learning officers and senior museum management staff attended every iteration of Neher’s *Telling Stories* masterclasses to help integrate the stories of everyday life into the museum’s programme. Neher’s research has informed the integration of everyday people’s stories in the museum’s public engagement strategy and through this has diversified the audience base to include hard\-to\-reach local audiences, including the under\-18 demographic. The Director of Curating and Research commented that “ *Dr Neher’s expertise in telling stories and audience development has enhanced the vitality and external influence of the museum with new audiences and generations in Ningbo and beyond”* **\[I\].** Drawing on Neher’s research into widening audience participation outside museum spaces **\(3\)** and new technologies as a way to broaden audience engagement **\(4\)**, Ningbobang organised weekly painting and calligraphy workshops, and a series of interactive activities utilising material and digital objects that ran alongside the exhibition *Listening to Open Appreciation, Run Wu Xi Wu Sheng* **.** The Director of Curating and Research also stated that *“the social education and cultural services will be better provided for young people through new technologies.”* **\[I\].**  Among the developments credited to Neher’s influence are the uptake of an official WeChat account for various activities, development of content for apps for the museum and using the audience’s comments to develop exhibition programming **\[I\]**. 

 The influence on public engagement strategy culminated during the 2019 special exhibition to commemorate the 70<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China – *Following the Motherland*. The exhibition was accompanied by a programme of activities that drew from the approaches presented at *Telling Stories* masterclasses. The Director of Curating and Research commented that *“Through Dr Neher’s ‘telling stories’ method, we were able to effectively reflect narratives of home and entrepreneurship through placing significant historical events in parallel with individual’s personal histories to lead the public to engage with and experience the development of the motherland for 70 years, and reflect the group spirit of Ningbobang”.* The Director of Curating and Research also stated that *“as a result of Neher’s research and teaching, Ningbobang has improved its public image by launching Ningbobang as a humanities brand, strengthening the sense of quality, and boosting the museum's public influence*” **\[I\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The search for exoplanets has been one of the most exciting areas of astrophysics over the last three decades. The University of Hertfordshire’s Centre for Astrophysics Research \(CAR\), through its development of novel data analysis algorithms and software, has played a central role in some of the most high\-profile exoplanetary discoveries in recent years. Evidenced through traditional media and social media metrics, these findings, including the identification of the ‘super Earth’ Proxima b in the habitable zone of the nearest star, have inspired ongoing debate in the public sphere about the nature and significance of these new worlds, engaging a global audience in the tens of millions. The effects have been: an increase in public awareness, curiosity and understanding of what lies beyond our own solar system; significant influence over the objectives of three pioneering exoplanetary exploration missions, including a $100m funded initiative; and the creation of new digital and artistic works designed to further fire the public imagination.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The discovery of planets beyond the solar system is widely recognised as having changed the way we view the Universe and our place within it. CAR researchers have played a significant role in shaping this new view using a wide variety of different techniques. Examples from the start of the research period are the pioneering of the precise measurement of polarisation in stars and star forming regions by developing instrumentation \[ **3.1**\] providing evidence for the low albedos of planets such as 51 Pegasi b and for the origin of homochirality in space as well as discoveries of free\-floating planets sometimes known as rogue planets. They have published more than 200 peer\-reviewed exoplanet\-related journal papers.  Here we emphasise the impact of CAR researchers in the development of novel algorithmic methods to facilitate some of the most high\-profile recent exoplanet discoveries around the closest stars to our solar system. 

 This area of research entered a new phase in 2004 with the appointment of Jones and Pinfield. Jones had previously co\-founded the Anglo\-Australian Planet Search, a long\-term survey to catalogue planets around 240 nearby stars of the southern hemisphere. This work was funded at Hertfordshire by the STFC \[ **G1, G2**\]. Pinfield led the EU\-FP7 Rocky Planets Around Cool Stars programme \[ **G3**\] expanding support for this work and used the 4\-metre UK Infrared Telescope to search for potentially habitable exoplanets at, for the first time, infrared wavelengths. Combined, these programmes allowed CAR researchers to develop and refine new algorithms to maximise the sensitivity for identifying exoplanets. In particular, this case study focuses on results from the radial velocity method: the identification of an orbiting planet from the ‘wobble’ of a star by the detection of small shifts in its spectral features. 

 Tuomi, Jones and Anglada\-Escudé identified initial evidence of exoplanets around two of the closest stars to the Sun – Proxima Centauri and Tau Ceti \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\]. They secured a Leverhulme grant PANDORA \[ **G4**\] to systematically reprocess and combine different high\-resolution radial velocity datasets in order to test for signals. Refinement of their analytical techniques led to Tuomi, with Anglada\-Escude and Jones, winning an international challenge competition in 2014\-15 to push the boundaries of the radial velocity method \[ **3.4**\]. This led to the ground\-breaking discovery of a rocky, Earth\-sized planet, named Promixa b, orbiting the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri 4.2 light years from Earth. It was published in *Nature* in 2016 \[ **3.5**\], featuring on the front cover. Tuomi had first submitted the paper in 2013 after combining data taken by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher \(HARPS\) at the La Silla Observatory and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Paranal Observatory in Chile. However, more evidence was requested by referees to conclusively show that the ‘wobble’ was a planetary signal, as opposed to stellar activity. PANDORA enabled the development of further analysis techniques and Anglada\-Escudé \(who gained a full\-time lectureship at Queen Mary University of London in September 2015\) to co\-ordinate the Pale Red Dot observing campaign including 30 scientists from eight countries. This enabled the team to obtain new datasets from other telescopes and ,in particular, a landmark campaign using HARPS to carry out regular observations for 60 nights. They were able to unequivocally confirm the planetary signal. An international team including Jones made further improvements to the reprocessing of the Proxima Centauri radial velocity data which further validated the signal, and the team announced a possible second planet – Proxima c – in *Science Advances* in 2020. 

 In 2018 an international team announced the discovery of a frozen planet orbiting Barnard’s Star, the next closest star system to the Sun after the Alpha Centauri triple star system. Again, the fingerprints of the planet, named Barnard’s Star b, were first identified by Tuomi using UH’s radial velocity method to analyse combined data from spectrometers based around the world. Another large\-scale collaboration and dedicated observing campaign coordinated by Anglada\-Escudé at QMUL, this time with the newly commissioned Spanish spectrograph CARMENES, confirmed the planetary signal and the results were published in *Nature* \[ **3.6**\]. 

 Other key milestones included the discovery in 2017 of four Earth\-sized planets orbiting Tau Ceti, 12 light years away from Earth. Two of them are located in the habitable zone \[ **3.7**\]. These discoveries built on the methods to combine multiple datasets distinguishing periodic signals from correlated noise to reveal previously hidden planets \[C, D\]. Feng, Tuomi and Jones packaged the winning software into a publicly available tool called Agatha \[ **3.8**\]. This software has now been automated and extended \(Agatha 2 and PEXO\), enabling a new generation of exoplanet discoveries.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CAR research has made a fundamental contribution to the most high\-profile exoplanetary discoveries in recent years. The identification of the exoplanet Proxima b, orbiting the closest star to the Sun, Proxima Centauri, attracted one of the highest levels of online attention out of all journal articles tracked by Altmetric, prompting comment from UK Government ministers on the UK’s science leadership role. It reached a global audience in the tens of millions and a social media audience close to seven million over a four\-year period. The in\-depth and sustained nature of the ensuing debate over the potential for life on exoplanets more generally has increased public interest in, and understanding of, our place in the wider universe. The research findings have shaped the core objectives of high\-profile interstellar space missions and inspired creative digital and artistic works designed to stimulate further public enjoyment of astrophysics. 

 **Increasing public understanding and stimulating curiosity about our place in the universe** 

 CAR researchers have proactively engaged with the media to maximise the impact of their discoveries and respond to strong public interest. Articles have featured explanations from CAR researchers about their data analysis techniques and what their findings mean in the context of the search for extra\-terrestrial life. The *reach* of the Proxima b discovery is evidenced through Altmetric data for the 2016 *Nature* paper \[ **3.6**\], \[ **5.1**\]. Its ‘Attention Score’ of 2566 \(at 31 Dec 2020\) – Altmetric’s high\-level measure of the quality and quantity of online attention received – means the paper’s public reach is ranked 1,184th out of a total 16.6 million outputs ever tracked; 17th out of 267,500 outputs of a similar age, and 5th out of 984 Nature outputs of a similar age. From the announcement of the discovery on 23 August 2016 to 31 December 2020, the paper was cited directly in 305 stories from 225 outlets around the world. It was referenced directly in 1,093 tweets from 1,049 users \(77% were members of the public\), reaching an audience size ‘with an upper bound’ of 6.9m people. According to Altmetric, **3.6** is cited on 15 Wikipedia pages, including the pages for ‘Exoplanet’ and ‘Solar System’; *Science Magazine* named it in its top ten scientific discoveries of 2016. Many other media articles and social media coverage have discussed Proxima b without directly citing **3.6**, so the discovery’s public reach is, in reality, much wider than Altmetric data can demonstrate. This allows a confident estimate that the total audience size reached over the impact period was in the many tens of millions. 

 The in\-depth, sustained media coverage and the themes it explored serve to demonstrate the *significance* of the impact \[ **5.2**\]. Articles reacting to the discovery discussed our place in the wider universe, the next age of space discovery and the possibility of life beyond Earth. *The Economist* devoted its front cover and leader to the Proxima b paper \[ **3.6**\] with the headline *Brave New Worlds – Pioneers, Planets and the next Space Age*. It said: ‘… *a new phase in the search for life elsewhere is about to begin*’ and compiled a guide ‘ *How to find exoplanets*’. Its leader article read: ‘ *New discoveries, intelligent devices and irrepressible dreamers are once again making space exciting*.’ Calling Proxima b ‘ *the planet we’ve all been waiting for*’, *New Scientist* wrote: ‘ *getting to Proxima b might become an existential requirement*’ and ‘ *finding out more about the planet should be a high priority*’. Coverage focused on whether Proxima b could host life. The likes of *BBC News* and the *Guardian* published videos of an artist’s representation of Proxima b. The BBC’s Science Editor called the discovery ‘ *a huge moment in the search for alien worlds*’ and said, ‘ *the fact that it is so close to us \- in the relative terms of deep space \- suddenly improves the chances of investigating if an exoplanet can be genuinely habitable*’. The *Guardian* included this independent quote: ‘ *It will be our prime laboratory for the search for extra\-terrestrial life for the decades ahead.’* The continued impact of the discovery itself on public knowledge and understanding of exoplanets is evidenced by the depth and breadth of follow\-on coverage; the debate over whether Proxima b could potentially support life played out in the public sphere, via mainstream and social media, for the remaining four years of the impact period \[ **5.2**\]. In 2017, the Financial Times reported that the Met Office had forecast the weather on Proxima b \(mostly dry, with heavy rainfall in two tropical zones\) and in 2020 NASA published its own climate simulations that explored a range of habitable climate scenarios \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The announcement in August 2017 of the discovery of four Earth\-sized worlds orbiting Tau Ceti also attracted significant and sustained public attention. According to Altmetric data \[ **5.3**\], paper **3.6** was covered in 68 news stories from 56 news outlets and reached up to 145,000 people through 71 tweets from 58 users. An article in *Scientific American* said the finding ‘ *seems to be at least as interesting as the Alpha Centauri stars*’. Popular US online magazine *Daily Beast* in 2018 underlined the scale of the research effort, saying: ‘ *Feng’s work on the Tau Ceti system last year stretched radial velocity to its absolute limits*.’ The *Nature* paper on Barnard’s Star \[ **3.7**\], published in November 2018, received an Altmetric attention score of 1,445. It was covered in 139 stories from 113 news outlets and reached an audience with an upper bound of 4.5m via 963 tweets from 852 users \[ **5.3**\]. The debate over whether Barnard’s Star b could potentially support life continued for the rest of the impact period \[ **5.4**\]. In 2019 the Proxima b and Barnard’s Star b papers were included in Nature’s public\-facing online collection of 43 articles on exoplanets to celebrate the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics \[ **5.5**\]. Nature wrote: “ *Together, these discoveries have changed the way we view the Universe, and our place within it*.” 

 Tuomi and Feng directly engaged the public in the search for exoplanets through articles for the online Pale Red Dot initiative, for which Tuomi was on the editorial team \[ **5.6**\]. This was a public engagement campaign to inspire people in astrophysics and STEM and reveal processes behind the science. Between 2016 and 2018 the Pale Red Dot campaign was followed by 3,711 people on Facebook and 3,100 people on Twitter. A live public Q&A with members of the Pale Red Dot editorial team about the Proxima b discovery was conducted through the popular online forum Reddit, hosted by AskScience \(which has 20.3m members on the platform\). The thread resulted in more than 1,000 questions and comments and attracted 9,600 likes \[ **5.6**\]. The Pale Red Dot Campaign won the Research Impact Award at the Guardian University Awards 2017 \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **Inspiring and shaping the objectives of space missions beyond our solar system** 

 UK Government ministers cited the Proxima b discovery as evidence of UK’s global leadership role in science \[ **5.7**\]. In the STFC media release, in which Jones and Tuomi were quoted, the Science Minister said: “ *The discovery of Proxima b adds to what has already been a momentous year for UK space research, and our global leadership in science and innovation.*” The Business Secretary said the finding was “ *testament to the hard work and scientific endeavour of UK institutions who are leading the charge and making discoveries that could change lives and inspire millions around the world.*” In fact, the identification of Proxima b also had a clear practical impact: it inspired or shaped the key objectives of three high\-profile space missions. 

 The discovery of Proxima b has shaped a multi\-million\-dollar programme to develop nano ‘space probes’ capable of reaching the Alpha Centauri system in just 20 years \[ **5.8**\]. With initial funding of $100m from Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, the Breakthrough Starshot project was launched by Milner, Zuckerberg and Hawking in 2016. Proxima b has become the initiative’s chief target. The project, which has received widespread media coverage, is ‘ *aiming to demonstrate proof of concept for light\-propelled spacecraft that could fly at 20 percent of light speed and, in just over 20 years after their launch, capture images and other measurements of the exoplanet Proxima b*’ \[ **5.8**\]. The *New Scientist* quoted the head of Breakthrough Starshot’s advisory board as saying: ‘ *It \(Proxima b\) shows that there is a target we can go and visit*.’ A presenter for The Sky at Night told the Guardian: ‘ *I think just having a target to aim for will inspire more. Now we know it’s there, surely we have to go?*’ \[ **5.8**\] The mission to Proxima b was explored in a 90\-minute BBC2 documentary screened in 2017 called *The Search for a New Earth*, co\-presented by Hawking \[ **5.8**\]. In 2017, *New Scientist* reported that NASA had begun plans for an interstellar space mission in 2069 to mark the 100th anniversary of the first moon landing. Proxima b is its key target \[ **5.8**\]. The discovery of Proxima b also inspired Project Blue, a mission to take the first image of an earth\-like planet in the Alpha Centauri star system. Covered by *Science* magazine and the BBC’s *Science Focus*, Project Blue aims to build and launch a compact telescope to image the habitable zones of the nearest Sun\-like stars to Earth \[ **5.8**\]. The identification of Proxima b demonstrated what might be possible. According to Project Blue: ‘ *… we now know that there’s a terrestrial\-class planet orbiting one of the stars in the Alpha Centauri system. This makes us optimistic that there could be other rocky planets orbiting Alpha Cen A and B*.’ \[ **5.8**\] 

 **Inspiring new creative digital and artistic outputs that engage the public imagination** 

 The discovery of Proxima b resulted in the creation of artistic representations of the exoplanet, further engaging the public imagination in what a rocky, Earth\-like planet four light years away might look like. A video titled *The exoplanet next door*, published by Nature on YouTube to accompany **3.6**, received 610,000 views, 3,400 likes and 861 comments \[ **5.9**\]. There are numerous creative digital animations and HD footage depicting Proxima b on YouTube. As an example, one video published by science channel *What If* in 2020, titled *What If We Relocated Humanity to Proxima B?*, received 1.3m views, 31,000 likes and 3,900 comments \[ **5.9**\]. In 2017 a documentary film on Proxima b – Journey to the Pale Red Dot – was broadcast on Amazon’s Prime Video \(it was still on the platform at the end of the impact period\) \[ **5.9**\]. In August 2020, NASA released an artist’s impression of a view of the surface of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri \[ **5.9**\]. In December 2020, an artist partnering with the same NASA team that announced the 2069 interstellar mission announced she was developing sound artwork ‘Tree of Life’ to be sent to Proxima b – a deliberate reference to the Golden Record, a phonograph record sent into space on NASA’s Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977 \[ **5.9**\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over 1,000,000,000 people worldwide are affected by serious fungal disease, resulting in over 1,500,000 deaths annually. University of Manchester \(UoM\) research led an evidence\-based global advocacy programme to address lack of diagnostics and generic antifungals as well as inadequate clinical skills. Denning set up the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections \(GAFFI\) in 2013 to mitigate the global impact of fungal diseases. Five antifungal drugs and eight key diagnostics are now flagged by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) as ‘Essential’, and GAFFI has produced estimates of fungal diseases for 65 countries. National clinical training programmes in Guatemala and Nigeria for HIV patients with life\-threatening fungal infections resulted in improved clinical skills and saved lives. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research programme documented the burden of multiple serious fungal diseases and gaps in data and knowledge, as well as a dearth in diagnostics and limited antifungal drug access. Application of UoM\-led research in Nigeria and Guatemala has shown how improvements in health systems can transform outcomes. 

###  a. Epidemiology of serious fungal diseases 

 The first global estimate of any fungal disease incidence was published in 2009 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since then, Denning and his international collaborators have reported modelled incidence and prevalence estimates of fungal diseases in >70 published papers. These include global estimates of prevalent cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis <ins>\(</ins>CPA\) after tuberculosis \(TB\) \[1\], complicating sarcoidosis \(72,000\), allergic aspergillosis in asthma \(\~4,700,000\), and cystic fibrosis \(6,675\). Also, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis \(135,000,000\), tinea capitis \(scalp and hair infection\) \(>200,000,000\) \[2\], annual incident cases of invasive aspergillosis complicating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \(1,000,000 \- 2,700,000\), cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS \(223,000\) \[3\] and sight\-threatening fungal keratitis \(1,050,000\-1,500,000\). GAFFI has published over 65 country\-specific incidence and prevalence estimates for serious fungal diseases. Cryptococcal meningitis deaths were estimated at 181,100, 15% of all AIDS deaths \[3\]. Modelling of the beneficial impact of timely diagnosis and treatment of lethal infections in AIDS \[4\] showed that many deaths were avoidable: >60,000 deaths had only 60% cryptococcal antigen testing and treatment with Amphotericin B and Flucytosine. All of these estimates have substantially increased fungal disease awareness, supporting health systems planning. 

###  b. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis \(CPA\) misdiagnosed as tuberculosis \(TB\) 

 The airborne fungus *Aspergillus* is the most common mould\-affecting human lungs, causing invasive life\-threatening infection, CPA and ‘fungal asthma’. We estimated 1,170,000 prevalent cases of CPA after TB globally \[1\]. Prospective cohort and cross\-sectional studies were launched in Nigeria, Uganda, Brazil and Indonesia. In Nigeria, 19% of people with unconfirmed TB \(\~45% of the total\) without HIV infection had CPA, not TB. In Indonesia, 10 \(8%\) of 128 patients had CPA at the end of TB therapy. The 5\-year mortality of CPA is 82.5%, if left untreated. We co\-ordinated the first multicentre trial of a commercial Pneumocystis PCR test \(common cause of pneumonia in AIDS\), drove development of new *Aspergillus* antibody tests, and, with GAFFI, pioneered a novel health systems approach to rapid diagnostics provision for HIV\-infected patients via a Diagnostic Laboratory Hub in Guatemala \[5\]. 

###  c. Enhanced access to antifungal therapy 

 Most current antifungal drugs are generic and were launched decades ago. Lack of antifungal availability is a critical gap, leading to serious illness and death. We undertook the first global analysis of antifungal drug availability \[6\]. Amphotericin B \(licensed 1959\) is not available in 42 of 155 \(43.1%\) countries; Flucytosine \(licensed 1973\), required for cyptococccal meningitis in AIDS, is unavailable in 94 of 120 \(78.3%\) countries \(and was not available in a single African nation\). Itraconazole \(licensed 1991\) is essential for histoplasmosis and aspergillosis, but its daily price varied from <USD1 to USD102, and in Nigeria and South Africa it is three\-to\-four times more costly than in the UK.

#  4. Details of the impact 

###  Context 

 Pre\-2013, public health mycology was a non\-existent discipline, until dissemination of our research transformed this landscape at the WHO and in the international academic arena. The scale of the problem is huge: nearly 50% of all AIDS deaths are attributable to fungi \[2,3,4\] and the leading infectious cause of death in leukaemia is aspergillosis. However, funding for fungal disease research represents only 2% of all infection and immunity funding, and the antifungal drugs market spend is also disproportionately low. 

###  Pathways to Impact 

 For 20 years UoM investigators have led research on and clinical care for aspergillosis. We set up the world’s first national service for any infectious disease in 2009 \(National Aspergillosis Centre, NAC\) in Manchester, providing a global beacon for chronic and allergic pulmonary aspergillosis. Our modelling \[1\] led to the first comprehensive attempt to estimate the country\-specific burden of most serious fungal diseases. In 2013, Denning founded an international foundation \- GAFFI \- primarily as an evidence\-based global advocacy voice for fungal diseases. Multiple UoM\-led epidemiological studies have estimated CPA burden and impact. Our research and GAFFI efforts have improved global awareness of the lack of diagnostics and generic antifungal agents \[6\] and UoM has led global engagement to address these missing elements in healthcare systems. 

###  Reach and Significance of the Impact 

###  a. Combatting aspergillosis: 

 In the UK, from August 2013 to March 2020, >2,500 patients were referred to NAC, >800 were diagnosed with CPA and >9,900 outpatient follow\-up appointments were attended \[A\]. Our modelling evidence has provided the impetus, clinical need arguments and commercial opportunities for the world’s first prospective clinical antifungal developments in CPA \(liposomal caspofungin \(Fujifilm\)\) and allergic aspergillosis \(inhaled azoles \(Pulmatrix, Pulmocide, TFF Pharmaceuticals and Zambon\)\), recently acknowledged at a US Food and Drug Administration public workshop \[B\]. Pulmatrix stated “ *the progress of our efforts to treat pulmonary fungal infections continue to be substantially aided by the world\-renowned expertise… available at the University of Manchester*” \[Ci\] and confirmed they have “ *raised over $60 million* \[USD60,000,000\] *through partnership and financing efforts to support R&D efforts…These efforts have been heavily influenced by the work of Dr Denning and his colleagues at the University of Manchester*” \[Ci\]. UK company Pulmocide stated UoM’s research “ *has enabled Pulmocide to focus on indications of highest unmet clinical need”* and had resulted in “ *increasing awareness by public health and regulatory authorities as to the importance of new therapies”* \[Cii\] *.* Our extensive experience in diagnosis and therapy has also been incorporated into European \[Di\], United States \[Dii\] and low and middle income country \[Diii\] guidelines for diagnosis and management of CPA. 

###  b. WHO adoption of fungal diseases, antifungal drugs and diagnostics: 

 Multiple proactive public health interventions have been adopted by WHO after dialogue with and applications from GAFFI based on UoM research, including: 

-  Adoption of 5 antifungal drugs on the WHO’s Essential Medicines List \(EML\) \(Amphotericin B and Flucytosine in 2013; Itraconazole, Voriconazole and Topical Natamycin in 2017 \[Ei\]; Echinocandins application submitted for 2021\). For context, from 1977 the WHO EML includes 460 medicines and is adopted by >140 countries. 

-  Several diagnostics were included on the WHO’s first List of Essential In Vitro Diagnostics, including microscopy, fungal culture, blood culture, histopathology and cryptococcal antigen and in 2019, *Histoplasma* antigen \[Eii\]. *Aspergillus* antigen and antibody, and *Pneumocystis* PCR have been accepted for the 2021 list as a direct consequence of UoM\-led research. 

-  WHO adoption in 2017 of chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses as Neglected Tropical Diseases \(NTDs\), under the broad label of ‘Skin NTDs’ \[F\]. 

-  Ensuring resistance surveillance in *Candida* spp. was incorporated into the WHO global antimicrobial resistance surveillance \(GLASS\) programme in 2018, the first time that fungi have been included as part of any global antimicrobial resistance surveillance \[G\]. 

###  c. Global health systems improvements: 

 In Guatemala, a national diagnostic and clinical training programme for opportunistic infections in AIDS was initiated during 2015 \[6\]. Developed by UoM, in collaboration with GAFFI, diagnostics and training were provided by Asociacion de Salud Integral \(ASI\). Guatemala has the worst record in Latin America of late stage, first presentations of HIV infection \(over 45%\). The programme has rapidly tested >2,500 patients annually \(with 18% life\-threatening infection risk\), allowing immediate administration of correct antifungal, anti\-TB, and/or anti\-HIV therapy. Greatly improved clinical management led to a fall in histoplasmosis 6\-month mortality risk to 29% \(previously >55%\). The overall programme mortality fell by 8% from 2017 to 2018. 

 The Chairman of the Board of El Mecanismo de Coordinación de Guatemala heralded “ *… the importance and success of this program, which has shown … how to avoid unnecessary deaths from advanced HIV…*” \[Hi\] \(translated\). The President of Infectious Diseases Society of Guatemala stated, “ *The University of Manchester and GAFFI deserve a great deal of credit for designing and implementing a world first program of this scale*” \[Hii\]. The UNAIDS Country Director, Guatemala, stated, “ *We congratulate GAFFI, the University of Manchester and ASI on this achievement... Undoubtedly, initiatives like this provide the framework for countries to institutionalize integrated approaches to meet the global goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030”* \[Hiii\]. Our work in Guatemala demonstrated how to achieve better clinical outcomes. As a result of this and GAFFI’s advocacy, the Pan American Health Organization published the first international guidelines for disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS \[I\], a mycology reference laboratory is being set up in Paraguay, and replication of the Guatemalan programme is planned in other countries, including Panama and Costa Rica. 

 We have also initiated implementation in Africa. In Nigeria, we supported the launch of a UoM\-developed training programme in diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS for >700 healthcare professionals across 13 sites. This programme led to significantly improved understanding of screening, diagnosis and best management practices \[J\], thereby providing a platform for implementing further capacity building interventions in HIV care.

#  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This research programme led to high\-level policy change with respect to the remuneration 

 of general practices in England, and to the monitoring and incentivisation of primary care 

 quality. Findings informed the development of the national primary care pay\-for\-performance scheme – the Quality and Outcomes Framework \(QOF\) – which directly affects the care of over 23,000,000 patients in the UK. Substantial changes to QOF resulted in the reallocation of over GBP400,000,000 of primary care funding per year by the NHS and the recalibration of national targets for primary care practice performance to more closely match remuneration to quality of care.

##  Policy context 

 Over the past two decades, policy makers worldwide have experimented with financial and reputational incentives for healthcare providers in order to improve quality of care. In 2004, the UK’s National Health Service \(NHS\) introduced the Quality and Outcomes Framework \(QOF\), which increased UK family practice income by up to 25% dependent on performance on 146 quality indicators. The QOF transformed the way practices provided care and measured quality. Over 200 similar schemes have since been implemented in over 40 countries, drawing on the UK’s experiences. 

##  Research context 

 Researchers at York have been at the forefront of international efforts to measure the equity and cost\-effectiveness of health service activity and were uniquely placed to assess the impacts of QOF and similar initiatives due to their combination of key skills and interests: i\) knowledge of healthcare system organisation, activity and data use; ii\) understanding of the behavioural impacts of incentives; iii\) econometric methodological expertise \(drawing causal inferences from observational data\); and iv\) maintenance of policy contacts in key governmental departments and agencies. Research teams at York quickly established an international reputation for expertise in this area, leading a series of collaborations with national and international partners. Research programmes have been supported by major funders including the Commonwealth Fund, the English Department of Health, the National Institute for Health Research and the Wellcome Trust, securing over GBP4,000,000 in funding. These programmes have produced over 50 peer\-reviewed publications \- cited over 2,000 times \- and results have been presented to worldwide policy and academic audiences. 

##  Key findings 

 Prior to 2013, research teams at York focused on measuring practice performance in response to financial and reputational incentives \(including unintended behaviours such as mis\-reporting\), and estimating the cost\-effectiveness of incentive schemes. After Doran – who had led some of this work from Manchester – joined York in 2013, research focused on the impact of incentives on patient outcomes, including emergency hospital admissions and mortality. 

 Financial incentives were found to be effective at improving targeted process of care \( **3.1**\), although impacts were often difficult to separate from other improvement initiatives, and there were improvements in data recording and teamwork. There were also unintended negative impacts, for example: many patients were inappropriately excluded from the scheme \( **3.2**\) 

  -  practices frequently mis\-reported performance \( **3.3**\) 

  -  performance for some non\-incentivized activities deteriorated relative to incentivized   activities \( **3.4**\) 

  -  continuity of care and patient centeredness declined 

  -  performance gains were lost after incentive withdrawal 

 Overall, there was little evidence for sustained improved patient outcomes, for example reduced hospital admissions, and only some elements of the scheme were cost\-effective \( **3.5**\). Crucially, QOF did not appear to save lives \- mortality rates for QOF conditions did not fall significantly faster than in comparator countries \( **3.6**\). These findings have informed development of QOF to date and the ongoing research continues to inform the transition of the scheme towards a more outcomes\-based framework.

##  Nature of impact 

 The research programme has had a major impact on the development of QOF. Changes to QOF are agreed in annual negotiations between the Department of Health \(DH\) and the British Medical Association \(BMA\), working on recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). Since 2009, members of the research team have directly advised NICE, instigating changes to the structure and scope of QOF, including: 

 \-   Removal of indicators: performance frameworks cannot cover all clinical areas, and achievement on indicators eventually reaches a point beyond which further improvement is not feasible and a rigorous approach to removal is therefore required. We developed key criteria on which indicator removal decisions were based and 46 indicators, accounting for over GBP403,000,000 in incentive payments, were removed from the programme between 2013 and 2018. 

 \-   Adjustment of achievement thresholds: under QOF, payments are scaled between a lower threshold, which sets the minimum level of achievement required, and an upper threshold, which indicates a high level of achievement. We developed a formula to calibrate achievement thresholds against historical performance levels, and this method for setting targets was implemented in 2013/14 for coronary heart disease indicators \( **5.1**\). This raised upper thresholds, and led to increases in average practice performance, for example: blood pressure and/or cholesterol was controlled for an additional 38,000 patients with coronary heart disease in England following the threshold changes \( **5.1**\). 

 Our work continued to inform development of the QOF programme, and in 2017 Tim Doran was appointed to the QOF Review Technical Working Group \( **5.2**\) **,** which was tasked with conducting a fundamental review of QOF and producing recommendations for reform or replacement of QOF \( **5.3, 5.4, 5.5**\). The Working Group reported in August 2018, recommending a fundamental restructuring of elements of QOF, including: 

-  targeting indicators at specific population segments 

-  introducing a personalised care adjustment to align indicators with clinical decision making and patient choice 

-  retiring ineffective indicators 

-  introducing a quality improvement domain to address clinical priority areas \( **5.4**\). 

 The review incorporated evidence from research on QOF and other physician incentive schemes conducted by a range of research groups, but most of the key evidence was derived from the work of our group \( **3.4**\). In the words of the Chair of the Working Group: 

 “The evidential review was heavily dependent on the research outputs of Professor Doran’s team, and his input to the subsequent working group discussions was instrumental in making the case for substantial changes to the framework, including the removal of ineffective quality indicators and better targeting of remaining indicators to appropriate patient groups.” \( **5.3**\) 

 As a direct consequence of the review, several changes were implemented for 2019/20 \( **5.6**\) representing a major reallocation of NHS resources, including: the retirement of 28 indicators \(worth over GBP200,000,000 in incentive payments\); the introduction of 15 new indicators \(worth over GBP130,000,000\) and the introduction of a new Quality Improvement domain \(worth over GBP90,000,000\). 

 The research has also achieved impact beyond academic and policy audiences, with national print \( **5.7**\) and broadcast \( **5.8**\) media using our research to raise concerns about the limited cost\-effectiveness of incentive programmes. Reports of our research highlighting potential negative impacts on unincentivized aspects of care prompted responses from the Chair of the British Medical Association's GP Committee and the Chief Executive of the Patients Association pressing for reform of the incentive programme, \( **5.9**\) leading the Department of Health and NHS England to undertake the national QOF Review in England \( **5.2**\). In Scotland, the QOF was discontinued altogether in 2016. 

##  Innovations 

 As QOF was implemented simultaneously across all UK practices, precluding the use of randomised trial approaches, a range of novel quasi\-experimental study designs \(including interrupted time series and synthetic control approaches\) were developed to estimate the causal effects of the scheme. A range of novel data linkages were also required for the studies. Our approaches and linkages have subsequently been adopted by other international research groups investigating these issues. This work has also had implications beyond the investigation of incentives, and helped to legitimise the use of quasi\-experimental methods in health services research. Research on QOF was also based on novel datasets that were generated to support implementation of the programme, requiring the development of new methods and definitions of quality/performance, and of extensive coding sets to enable interrogation of existing primary care clinical computing databases. The research team created the online Clinical Codes Repository to enable sharing of code lists between research groups, and this now holds 84,049 codes.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Dr Garikipati identifies that microfinance benefits India’s rural women most when used to enhance their livelihoods via improved market and social ties. It underpinned Dr Garikipati’s collaboration with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \(NABARD\), the regulator of India’s microfinance sector. This resulted in changing NABARD’s policy by introducing the *Livelihood Framework* \( *LF*\) that captures client’s journey from credit to livelihood and provides a mechanism to evaluate and enhance the impact of microfinance on women’s livelihoods. *LF* generates big data on rural livelihoods to further their intensification by identifying client\-training needs, supporting market\-development and group\-economic activities. NABARD implemented *LF* via its digital platform, EShakti. It reaches around 4.5 million women across 250 districts nationwide, significantly increasing the proportion of loans used on livelihood by 17% and saving the sector around £27 million in operational costs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Microfinance is a popular pro\-poor policy intervention adopted by several developing countries. Its main activity is to extend small loans to rural women with the intention to support their livelihoods for their empowerment and wellbeing. By March 2019, it is estimated to have reached around 140 million clients worldwide, with over 80% of them being women \( [Microfinance Barometer, 2019](https://www.convergences.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Microfinance-Barometer-2019_web-1.pdf)\). In India, over 85% of microfinance clients are rural women \( [NABARD, 2019](https://www.nabard.org/auth/writereaddata/tender/1207192354SMFI%202018-19.pdf)\). The true impact of microfinance on women’s livelihoods however is a matter of intense debate. Dr Garikipati research contributes to this debate. 

 Drawing on extensive field studies in India, Dr Garikipati carried out research on microfinance supported through a series of projects between 2003 and 2019 \(funded by DFID, Newton Trust, British Academy and ODA\). The research explores the link between microfinance and women’s empowerment via increased livelihood opportunities that connect them to the local economy and strengthen their social ties. Three research insights are particularly relevant to this impact case. 

 First, this research identifies high transferability of women’s loans within the household \(3.1\). Drawing on data from Andhra Pradesh, India, the research finds that over 80% of women’s loans are either used to enhance husband’s assets or in household consumption. In such cases, microfinance typically has a detrimental effect on women, mainly because of the repayment burden. By contrast, women who actually use loans to start or enhance their own enterprise benefit most via retaining control over their finances \(3.1, 3.5\). 

 Second, this research demonstrates that the real impact of microfinance on women’s empowerment and wellbeing can only be understood by studying the ‘processes’ they engage in after they receive credit \(3.3, 3.4\). Using simple ‘outcome’ measure like employment or income may be misleading. For instance, it would be incorrect to say that microfinance has resulted in enhanced livelihoods if the work women take up after receiving credit is degrading and detrimental, such as wage labouring undertaken only to meet loan repayments. The research reveals the importance of undertaking a ‘processes’\-led evaluation of women’s work following credit uptake, specifically examining the nature of their work in relation to ownership of productive assets. 

 Third, the findings of this research show that women microfinance clients who take up high value activities that connect them to the local economy and their credit groups are most likely to retain control over their money \(3.2, 3.6\). Participating in economic activity that improves their market contacts and strengthens their ties with their credit group is likely to positively impact women’s bargaining power within and outside the household. For instance, supplying rice to the local *agandwadi* school is likely to benefit a woman more than working on her husband’s rice farm; and starting a catering business with women from her credit group is likely to be empowering by strengthening her social ties.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Overview:** Dr Garikipati’s research was used to design the *Livelihood Framework* – a toolkit to evaluate the impact of the provision of microfinance in India *.  It provides a mechanism to monitor the effectiveness of microcredit in achieving its social objective of enhancing rural women’s livelihoods. It also supports this objective by identifying client\-training needs and opportunities for market\-development and group\-level economic activities. 

 **Engagement**: In 2016, Dr Garikipati’s outreach activities resulted in an invitation \(5.1\) from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development \(NABARD\), the regulator of India’s microfinance sector, to present her work to their Micro Credit Innovations Department \(MCID\), which is responsible for policy innovations in the sector. Following the initial presentation, Dr Garikipati continued to work closely with the MCID team, both virtually and by visiting them for further discussions \(5.2, 5.3\). Over two years, these engagements led to significant changes to the structure and content of their policy on collecting microfinance client data under NABARD’s ambitious digitisation programme called EShakti. Where earlier EShatki only captured client information that was pertinent to banking principles focused on repayments, the shift in thinking implied a willingness to consider client livelihoods as important to evaluate the effectiveness of microfinance. Significantly, this resulted in collaborative work between the MCID team and Dr Garikipati to develop the *Livelihood Framework* \( *LF*\), a novel approach to capture client economic activities after loan procurement. A NABARD policy report, documenting all the materials developed for *LF*, was published in April 2018 \(5.3\). 

 Commenting on this work, the Chairman of NABARD notes: *“The recommendations brought out* \(in the policy report\) *were very relevant and clearly links credit to women’s agency via livelihoods that connect women to local markets and their credit groups… A few of the recommendations were also useful to us in shaping and fine tuning the questions used for framing livelihood questions \(Livelihood Framework\)”* \(5.4\). 

 **The Policy:** LF captures information on client’s livelihoods that is unique to India’s rural context. It identifies whether loans are being used to support women’s livelihoods; ascertains the ‘processes’ governing women’s work; and pinpoints credit linkages to market and group\-based livelihoods that have been evinced to support women’s economic empowerment. *LF* consists of two specific applications: *Livelihood* *Schedule* and *Livelihood Module* \(5.3\). *Livelihood Schedule* captures livelihoods information for individual members and their credit groups. It is integrated into the Data Collection Format used by EShakti that enables initial capture \(5.5\). *Livelihoods Module* captures the dynamic aspects of livelihoods as they evolve via credit and training activities. It uses accessible tools to enable self\-reporting and is integrated into the EShakti App that captures the mutable aspects of credit groups. 

 **Reach and Significance**: NABARD operationalised *LF* as part of its EShakti programme in 2018. Detailing these events, the Chairperson of NABARD notes \(5.4\): “ *After a successful pilot covering 166,795 women* \[also see 5.2\], *it \(LF\) was subsequently rolled out to 250 districts across India, reaching just over 4.55 lakh* \[455,000\] *groups covered across the country*.” Each credit group has between 10 to 15 women so this translates to a reach of over 4.55 million rural women across India \(also see 5.8\). 

 Evidence from NABARD and its partners suggests that *LF* enhances women’s rural livelihoods by identifying client’s skill\-training needs and new opportunities for market expansion and group\-livelihood activities. It is also useful in monitoring the effectiveness of interventions planned to support livelihoods. Detailing the mechanism for this, the Chairperson of NABARD notes: “ *The new framework enables our microfinance partners design appropriate interventions that play a significant role in enhancing livelihoods of microfinance clients and monitor their effectiveness overtime”* \(5.4\). 

 The CEO of BASIX, which partners with NABARD in providing livelihoods training across rural India notes: “... \( *LF*\)  *helps in identifying vocational skill gaps… It also doubles up as a continuous monitoring tool to help evaluate the effectiveness of services provided…” “It helps plan provision of services… for… group economic activities enabling SHGs* \[to\] *tap* \[in\] *to the potential business in the market”* \(5.6\). 

 Further, *LF* has helped microfinance providers enhance the value of their existing credit portfolio and extend their reach to new markets, resulting in operational efficiencies as well as increased credit availability for livelihoods. The then Chief General Manager of Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank, a significant microfinance provider for the states of AP and Telanagana, notes: *“\[LF\] has meant we can offer customised financial products to clients according to their use of loan, specifically to encourage investment in income generating activities…. It has also helped us identify where market could be profitably expanded.This benefits hundreds of microfinance clients by improving credit availability, but also benefits our bank improve its market reach and returns from our rural microfinance sector”* \(5.7\). 

 Estimates collated by NABARD show that by enabling better identification of livelihood development needs of the poor, *LF* has significantly improved credit to livelihood linkages. In areas where *LF* is introduced, the proportion of loans being used for livelihoods have increased by 17%, from just 38% to 55% \(5.4, 5.8\). NABARD estimates also suggests that introduction of LF has increased operational efficiencies and resulted in a cumulative savings for the sector of around £27 million \(5.4\). In the words of the Chairperson of NABARD, “ *This initiative will go a long way in improving the livelihoods of rural women and in alleviation of rural poverty”* \(5.4\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Turner and Hall contributed significantly to intiatives on the protection of the environment within major European and international bodies. In turn, this enabled these bodies to strengthen environmental policy making and practice. Turner’s research contributed to the mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights and the Environment, and in particular to the drafting of the 2018 Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment, and to the decision for specific focus to be given to air pollution. Hall’s research on environmental crimes shaped the work of the environmental prosecutors and practitioners through a pan\-EU network and influenced practice in the prosecution and sentencing of environmental crimes across Europe.

 *Standards for Environmental Rights* 

 Over the last forty years, environmental rights discourse has emerged as a way of supplementing traditional environmental law discourse. Whilst the concept of environmental rights is well established and much debated, there has been a lack of understanding about how to actualise such rights. Turner \( **3.1**\) developed a method of macro analysis which he used to identify and analyse problems in the development of global environmental governance. This shows that decompartmentalising legal analysis can generate new insights into how environmental governance can be improved. Between 2015\-19, Turner led the ‘Standards in Environmental Rights Project’ involving 21 international experts. The project pioneered analysis of how standards of protection can be directly associated with environmental rights around the globe. The project contributed to the development of the substantive content of environmental rights and identified options for their implementation within legal institutions so as to stimulate strategies and policies relating to the use of human rights for the protection of the environment. This research project resulted in a key publication: Environmental Rights. The Development of Standards \( **3.2**\), where Turner et al defined methods for the identification and development of standards within environmental rights. Synthesising the project findings, Turner specifically showed how such standards can be accommodated within existing institutional structures \( **3.3**\). 

 *Environmental Crimes* 

 In 2014, Hall identified that there was a lack of empirical evidence to demonstrate what interventions or support victims of environmental harm needed \( **3.4**\), and showed that our understanding of victim needs was based upon theoretical discussions. This led Hall to question whether criminal justice and administrative law systems were properly meeting victim needs or indeed the wider needs of a community. By drawing upon findings from a more established victimological literature, he concluded that remedies such as mere payments of money were unlikely address the impacts of environmental harm on victims \( **3.4**\). Hall’s survey of the literature on civil, criminal, restorative and administrative justice showed the potential to bridge this gap, but he argued that there were cultural reasons preventing the extension of a wider range of support to victims. Hall concluded that further empirical research was required. A more complete account of these arguments, tested over a wider range of activities and scenarios, including corporate harm and transnational crimes was provided in **3.5** \(chapters 3 and 5\).  In this book, Hall advanced the state of knowledge by deconstructing the notion of environmental harm thereby enabling victims to be more readily identified and responses to wrongs developed \( **3.5**, chapter 7\). In other words, more calibrated constructions of harm and victim can be addressed through more carefully calibrated forms of environmental sanction \(administrative, criminal or other\). 

 This body of research fed into Hall’s contribution to a major pan\-European research project aimed at improving compliance with EU Environmental Law by Member States. Hall co\-authored a report revealing specific gaps in data as well as gaps in policy frameworks in 28 EU Member States \( **3.6**\). Drawing on his earlier his research findings on how to respond to environmental transgressions \( **3.5**, chapter 6\), and which identified importance of securing data on the victims of crimes and of considering alternatives to traditional penalties \( **3.5,** chapter 3\), Hall specifically recommended: \(i\) the systematic recording of data into a shared repository; \(ii\) the development of coordinated concepts of components of crimes; \(iii\) changing the over\-reliance on small fines as a means of punishing offenders; and \(iv\) targeting the activities of corporate actors and transnational crime groups \( **3.6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research conducted at the University of Lincoln shaped two areas of policy and practice: \(i\) international policy on environmental standards; and \(ii\) policy and practice in respect of environmental crimes across Europe. 

1.  **Enhancing Global Policy on the Use of Environmental Standards** 

 The United Nations is committed to safeguarding the environment and human rights, and to achieving all 17 UNSDGs in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This is a major policy agenda cutting across the work of UNEP and UN Human Rights, as well as impacting on the practices of all States. The work of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment is central to this agenda. As recognised by the Special Rapporteur \( **5.5**\), Turner has played an influential, supporting role in this agenda by \(a\) generally informing the Special Rapporteur’s mandate and \(b\) informing specific projects and reports undertaken by the Special Rapporteurs. This has helped enable the Special Rapporteurs to deliver an important part of their mandate to identify, promote and exchange views on good practices relating to human rights obligations and commitments to inform, support and strengthen environmental policy making specifically in the area of environmental protection \( **5.1**\). 

1.  *Shaping Policy Mandates.* 

 Prior to the REF period \(2012\), the Human Rights Council appointed Professor John Knox as the first United Nations Independent Expert on Human Rights and the Environment. Between 2012 and 2015 his main focus was to study and report on the developing field of human rights and the environment. However this mandate came up for review in 2015. Professor Knox played an integral part in the early development of the ‘Standards in Environmental Rights Project’ led by Turner. Turner was then able to use the findings from the project \( **3.2**; **3.3**\) to inform his representations to the Special Rapporteur through the UN Human Rights consultation processes.  Turner demonstrated how environmental rights could be given clarity and tangible meaning through their equation with specific standards. In addition to informing the form and content of the Framework Principles \(section b below\), Turner et al’s research informed Knox’s renewed mandate. This is confirmed by the Special Rapporteur, who testifies that Turner’s ‘work on human rights and the environment has helped to inform my mandate generally’ \( **5.5**\).  When the mandate was renewed by the Human Rights Council in 2015, Knox’s role was repurposed from Independent Expert into that of a Special Rapporteur, and the mandate now covers a wider and more purposeful remit to identify, promote and exchange views on good practices in the use of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment \( **5.1**\). In line with Turner et al’s research, the Special Rapporteur’s new mandate specifically included a remit to identify challenges and obstacles to their full realization. Furthermore, the mandate shifted to focus more on implementation and compliance, which reflected the work of the ‘Standards in Environmental Rights Project’. 

 Through a UN consultation process, Turner drew upon his expertise in environmental rights \( **3.1**\- **3.3**\) to inform the new Special Rapporteur’s \(Dr Boyd\) decision to make the focus of his first Thematic Report on ‘Clean Air and the right to a healthy and sustainable environment’ in 2019 \( **5.2**\).  This specifically urged States to establish air quality legislation, regulation and standards. Turner was one of only two independent academic experts to supply evidence to Boyd.  Drawing on his expertise on environmental rights \( **3.1\-3.3**\), he specifically identified the need to target corporate actors and provided examples of good practice in respect of GHG reductions \( **5.3**\) for the Special Rapporteur’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Thematic report on ‘Safe Climate’.  This informed the Special Rapporteur’s analysis and final recommendations \( **5.4**, para 16\-25, 77\(c\) and 81\). 

1.  *Informing the Content of Global Policy Documents.* 

 In order to inform his preparation of a report to the UN Human Rights Council and composition of a set of Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment, the Special Rapporteur initiated a consultation process in October 2017. As an invited consultee, Turner submitted evidence to the Special Rapporteur highlighting gaps within exiting environmental protection regimes and specifically on the lack of effective enforcement mechanisms. He expressly called for the Framework Principles to include obligations for states to legislate on ‘standards’ of environmental protection but also to ensure that enforcement and compliance mechanisms \(of those standards\) are fit for purpose. This evidence was influential in the decision of the Special Rapporteur to accommodate specific points within the Report and the ‘Framework Principles’.  Professor Knox confirms that Turner’s submissions were ‘among those that were most well\-supported and that most influenced the process’ \( **5.5**\). Turner’s research is reflected in the text of two provisions of the Framework Principles \(UN Doc. A/HRC/37/59\): Principle 11 provides that ‘States should establish and maintain substantive environmental standards that are non\-discriminatory, non\-retrogressive and otherwise respect, protect and fulfil human rights’. Principle 12 provides that ‘States should ensure the effective enforcement of their environmental standards against public and private actors.’ 

 Turner was consulted by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) in developing its ‘Global Strategy on Health, Environment and Climate Change’ 2018.  His research assisted the WHO identify gaps in the legal framework as presented in previous WHO guidance concerning the responsibilities of states relating to environmental rights. As a result of this, the WHO strategy was revised to incorporate Turner’s advice \( **5.6**\).  Drawing on the Standards in Environmental Rights Project’ and published research on quantitative environmental rights \( **3.2**; **3.3**\), Turner also contributed to the drafting process of training materials to UN Environment for use in their Global Judges Programme. The influence and value of Turner’s contribution is confirmed by the training programme lead, Professor Daly \( **5.7**\). In addition to publication **3.4**, Turner’s research informed a core training manual, the UN Environment ‘Global Judicial Handbook on Environmental Constitutionalism’. The UN Environment programme delivers training to judges from over 100 countries and the research on environmental standards is enhancing the capacity of judges to make use of international best practice in the exercise of their judicial function. 

1.  **Enhancing Prosecutors’ and Judicial Capacity to Address Environmental Crimes in Europe** 

 According to the European Environmental Bureau \(Crime and Punishment Report March 2020\), environmental crimes are estimated to cost $258billion/year globally and €50billion in the EU. It is also one of the ten priority areas of the EU Policy Cycle in the fight against organised and serious international crime \(2018\-21\). 

 Hall’s expertise led to significant activities with the Network of Environmental Prosecutors \(ENPE\). An informal network established in 2012, ENPE received funding in 2015 under the EU LIFE programme for a project to develop compliance with environmental law \(the LIFE ENPE project\). Drawing on Hall’s expertise \( **3.4\-3.5**\), LIFE ENPE commissioned Hall to produce a baseline ‘Capitalisation and Gap\-filling’ Report of what is known about environmental crime, and how it is being approached by prosecutors and judges in all 28 EU Member States. Hall and Wyatt’s subsequent Report identified key stakeholders and other users of training and information on environmental crime, providing a key contribution for ENPE in confirming a lack of consistent reviewable data on the reporting, prosecution and sanctioning of environmental crimes across Europe. \( **3.6**; also **5.9**, section 6.1\) This was something suspected, but only here confirmed by research \(see **5.9**, section 6.1\), and as the first principal project delivery for LIFE ENPE, Hall and Wyatt’s Report fundamentally informed the wider activities of the project. It specifically informed the conduct of other project activities, such the development of training needs analysis and delivery \( **5.9**, section 6.1\). The Report specifically identified themes and topics where training, guidance and awareness raising were most needed \( **5.9**\). 

 Hall’s research also facilitated the growth and formal establishment of ENPE into a new international not\-for\-profit association *ENPE aisbl* in 2016 \(see  [https://www.environmentalprosecutors.eu/background](https://www.environmentalprosecutors.eu/background)\). By confirming the paucity of data gathering and exchange, calling for improvements in data sharing and use practices, and identifying key stakeholders for this network, the Report \( **5.9**\) was a key piece of evidence in the drive to grow the network as a means of addressing these practical issues. Originally comprising eight members, it now comprises 45 member organisations from 30 countries. In addition, the sharing of the Report led to improved dialogue and links with other EU practitioner networks \(such as the European Union Judges Forum for the Environment, the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law, and the Environmental Crime Network\). This dialogue and collaboration with practitioners further improved the collation and dissemination of information on environmental crime across wider networks of practitioners \( **5.9**, section 6.1\). Second, as a training tool, the research is used to train judges and prosecutors, and through the ENPE led to harmonising of environmental law concepts and changed practitioner understandings of barriers to the prosecution of environmental crimes \( **5.10**\). Hall and Wyatt’s Report formed part of a resource toolkit used by sentencing practitioners in the across the EU dealing with environmental crimes, which has been delivered to over 430 organizations and 1000 individual environmental crime specialists through the ENPE \( **5.8**\). This is one of the largest pan\-European environmental initiatives on crime practitioner awareness raising and training initiative to date.  Third, through changed practices, the research has resulted in more effective and successful prosecutions for environmental crimes – and potential deterrence to harmful environmental activities \( **5.10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Insecticide Treated Nets \(ITNs\) are the main malaria prevention tool in Africa, but their efficacy is being eroded by pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito vectors. LSTM’s research determining the underlying molecular mechanisms led to new classes of ITNs that can control resistant mosquito populations. Our research and advocacy led to the founding of the Product Development Partnership IVCC and has generated the evidence leading to deployment of new classes of ITNs. By 2020, 13 of the 23 malaria endemic countries in Africa included these new classes of nets in their national distribution campaign, protecting over 35,000,000 individuals. A large\-scale trial in Uganda found that use of this new net class reduced malaria prevalence by 27%. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2000 the global burden of malaria, especially in Africa, has reduced. Clinical incidence of malaria across the continent decreased by over 50% between 2000 and 2018, and annual deaths decreased from 596,000 to 405,000. The decline has been largely attributed to the distribution of over 2,000,000,000 pyrethroid insecticide\-treated bednets \(ITNs\) protecting at\-risk populations from bites from malaria mosquitoes that typically feed indoors and at night. However, the success of ITNs is threatened by the rapid increase in pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes. All ITNs contain pyrethroids, and resistance is putting the entire global fight to reduce, and ultimately eliminate, malaria at risk. Historically, malaria resurges rapidly if effective interventions are not maintained at an adequate level of coverage and effectiveness. Reversing this trend is difficult and imposes major economic and public health burdens on the disease endemic countries. 

 LSTM has pioneered research into the causes, consequences and rapid spread of pyrethroid resistance in African malaria vectors and provided evidence\-based solutions to combat the problem. 

 **Mosquito genetics and behaviour** 

 Understanding the genetic basis of resistance in mosquitoes has driven the development of strategies to lessen its impact. Since 2003, LSTM researchers \(Donnelly, Paine, Lycett, Ranson, Weetman, Wondji\) used a variety of genomic and biochemical approaches to identify the key genetic changes associated with pyrethroid resistance. We found the most potent mechanism present in African malaria vectors to be increased rates of insecticide detoxification, caused by elevated production of a small number of cytochrome P450 enzymes that are very efficient at metabolizing this insecticide class \[1\]. We developed *in vitro* and *in vivo* platforms for screening new insecticides for potential cross\-resistance, which have been widely adopted by agrochemical companies \[2\]. Novel video techniques \(developed by McCall\) to observe and measure mosquito behaviour at bed nets demonstrated that the vast majority of activity occurs at and above the roof of the net \[3\], a seminal discovery that had major impacts for bednet design; for example, in trials in Liverpool and Burkina Faso, McCall has shown that small net panels, or barriers, attached outside the top of a bed net, improve the net’s performance, while using less insecticide. 

 **Impact of resistance on malaria control** 

 LSTM has been monitoring and mapping insecticide resistance spread in Africa for over 20 years and has supported World Health Organization \(WHO\) in the generation, analysis and dissemination of this data via lead author contributions to the *Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance in Malaria Vectors* \(2012\) \(Coleman, Ranson and Hemingway\) and the *Global Report on Insecticide Resistance in Malaria Vectors; 2010\-2016* \(2018\) \(Coleman\). We have developed new bioassay approaches for pyrethroids \(and new insecticides with novel modes of action\) and developed a comprehensive suite of molecular markers to track the spread of resistance through the application of genomic technologies \(Ranson, Weetman, Wondji, Donnelly\). These tools have enabled the impact of resistance on malaria transmission to be directly assessed \[4\] and are being incorporated into WHO guidelines. 

 **Evaluation of new vector control tools to combat insecticide resistance** 

 The Liverpool Insect Testing Establishment \(LITE\), established by Ranson and housed within LSTM’s Vector Biology Department, has developed a screening pipeline to evaluate new insecticides and formulations against fully characterized resistant mosquito colonies \[2\]. All the major insecticide and ITN manufacturers have utilized LITE’s services to assess performance of new insecticides and formulated products against our mosquito colonies, and many of these industry partners have also enlisted LSTM’s expertise for field trials. For example, an LSTM\-led consortium conducted the first clinical trial of a dual insecticide bednet \(Olyset Duo®\) in Burkina Faso, which demonstrated a significant public health benefit of these nets in areas of high pyrethroid resistance \(decrease of 12% in malaria incidence, p=0.04\) \[5\]. Hemingway and Donnelly led the evaluation of the first operational deployment of PBO\-pyrethroid nets in Uganda; 12 months post deployment, PBO\-pyrethroid nets reduced malaria infection prevalence by 27% \(p=0.0001\) and malaria mosquito density in houses by 87% \(p<0.0001\) relative to conventional nets \[6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The beneficiaries of two decades of research at LSTM on the biology and behaviour of  malaria mosquitoes include: \(1\) bednet manufacturers, who have translated our research into new ‘resistance\-breaking’ nets that now make up a significant share of total net sales; \(2\) communities in malaria\-endemic regions of Africa, who are now at reduced risk of malaria; \(3\) global policy makers and implementers, who have a strengthened evidence base on which to select malaria\-prevention tools; and \(4\) national malaria control programmes, who have an improved toolset to mitigate against insecticide resistance. 

 **Impact on bednet manufacturers, agrochemical companies and the communities their products protect** 

 LSTM’s research into the mechanisms of insecticide resistance has directly led to the development of new ITNs. Our evidence that blocking P450\-based metabolism with the synergist piperonyl butoxide \(PBO\) can restore pyrethroid efficacy in malaria mosquitoes led to manufacturers developing a new class of nets that contain pyrethroids plus PBO, with the aim of maintaining ITN efficacy even in the face of pyrethroid resistance. Four manufacturers \(Vestergaard \(Switzerland\), Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd \(Japan\), AKA Polymers \(India\) and Moon Netting \(Pakistan\)\) now produce PBO\-pyrethroid nets. These have all been pre\-qualified by WHO \(a necessary step before most major donors will procure a new type of net\). Over 43,000,000 PBO\-pyrethroid nets were distributed in Africa in 2020, protecting over 95,000,000 people. Since 2020, 27 of the 40 African national ITN distribution programmes included PBO\-pyrethroid nets, with PBO\-nets constituting 21% of the market share of nets delivered to Africa for malaria prevention in 2020 \[1\]. 

 The discovery that malaria vector mosquitoes preferentially contact the top of a net when seeking a bloodmeal led one major net manufacturer \(Vestergaard\) to incorporate PBO only into the roof panel in their market leading PermaNet 3.0 ®. Since 2017, LSTM have been working with Vestergaard to develop novel bednet prototypes exploiting this aspect of mosquito behaviour. Limiting insecticides to small external net barriers improves the net’s performance, while using less insecticide thereby reducing manufacturers costs, and limiting the risk of adverse effects caused by insecticide exposure \[2, 3\]. 

 Our clinical trial of the pyriproxyfen\-pyrethroid net, Olyset Duo®, demonstrated the potential of insect sterilizing agents to reduce malaria transmission when combined with pyrethroid insecticides in bednets. Although Olyset Duo® is not currently being deployed, the positive results of our trial of ITNs with this mode of action led to a very similar competitor product \(Royal Guard, DCT USA that was listed by WHO in 2019\) being deployed in Mozambique and Nigeria since 2020 \(1,000,000 nets distributed in 2020\) \[1, 4\]. 

 Hemingway established the Innovative Vector Control Consortium \(IVCC\) in 2005 at LSTM. IVCC is the leading global agency for the development of new insecticides and vector control tools. The consortium has re\-formulated two classes of agricultural insecticide that have been in use for indoor residual spraying, a very effective alternative to ITNs for malaria control, since 2014. Rotation of these chemistries has enabled the implementation of resistance management strategies, and these new formulations have been deployed in indoor residual spraying in 30 malaria endemic countries, averting over 4,800,000 malaria cases between 2016 and 2019 \[5\]. In addition, the work of the Liverpool Insect Testing Establishment \(LITE\), plus the suite of tools developed by LSTM including the P450 *in vitro* screen and transgenic mosquito lines, has streamlined the insecticide development pathway, terminating investment in chemistries exhibiting potential resistance liabilities and accelerating the most promising candidates. For example, the multi\-national agrochemical company Syngenta \(Switzerland\) used the LSTM testing pipeline as a critical differentiator to drive candidate selection and investment decisions \[6\]. 

 **Impact on global policy makers, implementation agencies and national malaria programmes** 

 LSTM led the evaluation of PBO\-pyrethroid classes of nets pre and post deployment. Our meta analyses of the performance of PBO\-pyrethroid versus standard ITNs on mosquito populations, which Ranson presented at Evidence Review Groups on PBO\-pyrethroid nets at WHO in 2015 and 2017, led to policy recommendations on use of this net class \(WHO 2015, 2017\) \[7\]. We conducted one of only two clinical trials that have demonstrated significant improved public health benefit of PBO\-pyrethroid nets in reducing malaria transmission compared to standard ITNs; the scale of this trial was unprecedented and enabled 10,700,000 Ugandans to benefit from the increased protection afforded by this new net class \(reduction of 27% in malaria prevalence\) whilst the evaluation was ongoing \[8\]. 

 LSTM vector biologists play a key role in advising WHO. Donnelly was the lead entomologist on the WHO study on the impact of insecticide resistance on malaria control \(between 2012 and 2016\) which helped raise the profile of the public health threat posed by pyrethroid resistance. We have been members of the WHO Vector Control Advisory Group \(VCAG\) since its inception in 2014 \(Hemingway, Ranson\) advising WHO on trial designs, and evaluating results from trials prior to policy recommendations. Wondji is a member of the WHO pre\-qualification team of independent assessors who review data packages submitted by ITN manufacturers to determine whether these meet accepted WHO standards \[9\] 

 LSTM has made a major contribution to the development of WHO guidelines on resistance monitoring and management, both from the outputs of our research which has informed best practice, and via our participation in WHO committees. For example, Ranson and Donnelly contributed to the 2016 *WHO guidelines on insecticide resistance monitoring* and Coleman, Hemingway and Ranson were major contributors to the 2012 WHO *Global Report on Insecticide Resistance Management in malaria vectors* \[10\]. Via long\-term partnerships with African Ministries of Health, we have greatly strengthened capacity in resistance monitoring and supported the interpretation of national data to inform the sub national deployment of different insecticide\-based strategies \(e.g. Zambia and Equatorial Guinea Insecticide Resistance Management Plans and policy briefs for Malawi \[11\]\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Osteopathy has historically been underpinned by a limited evidence base, but UCO research studies have had a cumulative impact on improving professional knowledge and changing the culture of practice. Empirical knowledge has been generated \- about treatment risks and adverse events to improve safety in clinical practice; to improve osteopaths’ awareness of, and attitudes to, using evidence\-informed practice; and to develop guidelines to support best practice for common musculoskeletal conditions. A portfolio of outputs influenced changes in the General Osteopathic Council’s \(GOsC\) standards of practice and continuing professional development \(CPD\) regulations for the specified activities required for annual registration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 To explore safety issues in osteopathic practice, **SV** led the Clinical Risk in Osteopathy and Management study \(CROaM\) \( **1.** **Vogel et al, 2013**\), funded by the GOsC to gather data on adverse effects. The survey included 1,082 UK osteopaths \(27.8%\) and 2,057 patients \(77% at 6 week follow\-up\), plus interviews with 19 patients and 24 practitioners. Temporary side\-effects were reported by 4% of patients, but not directly linked to manipulation. Concerning deficits in osteopaths’ communication and consent processes were identified. The report concluded that serious problems were rare, but osteopaths should be vigilant about risk. Enhanced guidance about consent and adverse event reporting were recommended. Following this, **OT** co\-authored a GOsC\-funded report to identify how regulatory activities could support practice and align with professional standards \( **2.** **McGivern et al 2015**\). Literature reviews explored scope of practice, health professional regulation and fitness to practise, with an online survey of 809 osteopaths \(17%\) and 55 interviews. Limited evidence about treatment risks and benefits were reported as sources of professional insecurity and ambivalence about evidence\-based practice \(EBP\). Diverse approaches made standard\-based regulation complex, especially with independent practitioners. The report recommended introducing peer discussions into osteopathic regulation processes. 

 Subsequently, **OT** collaborated in a survey of osteopaths’ attitudes to EBP; the Evidence\-Based Practice Attitude and Utilisation Survey \(EBASE\) \( **3.** **Sundberg et al 2017**\). Generally positive attitudes and moderate\-level skills, but infrequent use of EBP were reported by 375 osteopaths. Perceived barriers included lack of time and limited osteopathic evidence, indicating the need to improve osteopaths’ use of EBP in clinical practice. To promote to EBP, **SV** participated in a guideline development group; NICE guidelines for low back pain and sciatica in over 16s \( **4.** **NICE 2016**\). New recommendations that manual therapy should only be offered in packages incorporating exercises or psychological interventions highlighted an urgent need to change  monomodal, biomechanical treatment models, prompting research into biopsychosocial approaches \(Case Study 2\). **SV** also collaborated in developing the IFOMPT Cervical Framework Document \( **5.** **Rushton et al 2020**\), providing guidance for physical therapists to minimise risks in the clinical management of patients with head and neck pain. Arterial pathologies in the neck may masquerade as musculoskeletal dysfunction and lead to serious consequences if not identified. New guidance about  avoiding provocative positional testing were based on its’ low predictive ability and potential adverse test effects. Recommended changes in history taking, examination and decision\-making were used to strengthen osteopathic training and CPD. 

 Paediatric osteopathy is also limited by lack of evidence on treatment effects. **DC** led a systematic review into manual therapy effects for unsettled, distressed and excessively crying infants \( **6.** **Carnes et al 2017**\). Nineteen studies \(seven RCTs\) found moderate strength evidence for favourable effects on crying time but inconclusive results for sleep and parent\-child relations. Risks were low at seven non\-serious events per 1000 infants. It was unclear whether the small effect sizes were meaningful, but manual therapy was relatively safe. Findings led to development of a randomised controlled trial in paediatric osteopathy.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research into the risks of adverse events, especially in cervical spine assessment and manipulation, and into communication and informed consent led to substantive changes in the General Osteopathic Council’s \(GOsC\) regulatory policies. The cumulative impact of  [<ins>UCO research on adverse events</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/research-surveys/gosc-research/adverse-events/) is documented in committee reports about changes to the Osteopathic Practice Standards \(OPS\), Guidelines for Osteopathic Pre\-Registration Osteopathic Education \(GOPRE\) and Continuing Professional Development \(CPD\) scheme. 

 The Clinical Risk in Osteopathy and Management study \(CROaM\) identified deficits in communication about consent \( [<ins>Vogel et al 2013</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/research-and-surveys/the-croam-study-february-2013/croam-full-report-0313.pdf)\). A report on professional regulation and compliance with standards identified challenges in monitoring osteopaths with diverse clinical practices \( [<ins>McGivern et al 2015</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/research-surveys/gosc-research/research-to-promote-effective-regulation/)\).  [<ins>Rushton et</ins> <ins>al’s</ins>](https://www.ifompt.org/site/ifompt/IFOMPT%20Cervical%20Framework%20final%20September%202020.pdf) \(2020\) IFOMPT report outlined risks relating to cervical spine treatment. This data has been incorporated into changes in GOsC expectations about standards of practice for qualified osteopaths \( **Source 1,**  [<ins> **GOsC</ins> <ins>2018**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pac-june-2018-osteopathic-practice-standards-implementation/)\) and levels of competence in undergraduate student education \( **Source 2,**  [<ins> **GOsC</ins> <ins>2020**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pec-october-2020-item-3-review-of-guidance-for-pre-registration/)\). Regulatory changes also include requirements for osteopaths to engage in case\-based peer discussions as part of three\-year CPD cycles, recommended by McGivern et al \(2015\) to promote engagement with standards in confidential, formative activities to highlight weaknesses and reduce misconduct, whilst acknowledging diverse attitudes and approaches. Osteopaths must now also participate in formal ‘Communication and Consent’ CPD activities \( **Source 3,**  [<ins> **GOsC**</ins>](https://cpd.osteopathy.org.uk/themes/communication-and-consent/) <ins> **2021**</ins>\). 

 The study of clinical risks \(Vogel et al 2013\) led to a collaborative review of assessment methods for serious cervical spine dysfunctions \( **Source 4**  [<ins> **Vaughan et al 2016**</ins>](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2016.01.007)\). Findings have been used to enhance osteopaths’ communication, consent and clinical reasoning skills in popular, ongoing <ins>CPD</ins>  [<ins>courses</ins>. <ins>Communication and consent</ins>](https://cpd.uco.ac.uk/communication-and-consent-14-may-2021) ran 10 times between 2014 and 2020 with 274 osteopaths \( **Source 5a**\). Findings from CROaM also generated CPD courses about the risks specific to  [<ins>cervical spine assessment and consent</ins>](https://cpd.uco.ac.uk/cervical-spine-risk-assessment-and-consent-for-manual-therapists-30-january-2021) \( **Source** **5b**\), which ran 9 times between 2017 and 2020 with 258 osteopaths and other health practitioners. IFOMPT recommended changes to decision\-making processes for cervical spine manipulation \(Rushton et al 2020\) and recommended that practitioners should now avoid provocative testing. This guidance has been integrated into courses which cover shared decision\-making, informed consent, medico\-legal frameworks, and safety issues for practitioners who teach cervical spine manipulation techniques. 

 The GOsC commissioned a follow\-up study to McGivern et al \(2015\), which recently reported that attitudes to EBP within the profession have changed in response to guidance from research\-active OEIs \( **Source 6**  [<ins> **McGivern et al 2020**</ins>](https://www.osteopathy.org.uk/news-and-resources/document-library/about-the-gosc/pec-october-2020-item-9-mcgivern-research/)\). UCO contributions to this sea change include SV’s involvement in NICE \(2016\) guideline development, which increased national awareness of EBP for back pain and supported his subsequent contribution to the  [<ins>National Back Pain Pathway,</ins> ](https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/charles-greenough/)which guided EB implementation by national CCGs. In the UCO, changes in clinical training since 2017 require students to identify use of guidelines in their documented patient assessment and management plans. Recent qualitative research reported increased awareness and positive attitudes, but continued lack of confidence in using EBP **\(Source 7**  [<ins> **Inman and Thomson 2019**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2019.01.001)\), indicating a need for further skills training \(Case Study 2\). The UK survey of attitudes to EBP \( [<ins>Sundberg et al 2018</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12891-018-2354-6)\) was replicated in Australia \( **Source 8**  [<ins> **Leach et al 2019**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-019-4329-1)\), and subsequently in Sweden, Spain and Italy, which raised osteopaths’ awareness internationally. Similar findings in several countries has prompted research into barriers to EBP implementation, with future impact anticipated from a recently published systematic review protocol \( [<ins>Sampath et al 2020</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2020.01.001)\). 

 In the UK, osteopaths deliver paediatric care for approximately 1 in every 9\-11 children, but there is limited evidence about manual therapy effects on infants and parents and carers. Many infants treated by osteopaths have symptoms of colic including excessive crying, unsettled, distressed or difficult to console, but evidence of effect is limited \(Carnes et al 2018\). A recent systematic review indicated favourable but weak evidence for crying time \( **Source 9**  [<ins> **Ellwood et al 2020**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035405)\), highlighting an urgent need for new research. This led to the development of CUTIES, the Crying Unsettled and disTressed Infants Effectiveness Study of osteopathic care \( **Source 10**  [<ins> **Carnes et al 2020**</ins>](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2020.08.001)\). This two\-arm, multi\-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial is recruiting 112 infants, randomised to receive best practice advice and support plus either specific or non\-specific \(control\) light touch manual therapy. Parents are blinded to group and outcomes include crying time over 14 days, parent satisfaction, adverse events and cost. Results anticipated in 2022 will generate evidence about treatment effect and provide the Advertising Standards Authority with data to assess the validity of advertising osteopathy for this common, distressing paediatric condition.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 As the threat of, and the actual manifestations of terrorism continue to grow, research by Lowe on ‘Prevent’ \(\*see below\) significantly influences policy and practice.  Lowe’s research challenges the social and political perception of terrorism and radicalisation *,* the legal context of conflict and security, and the term radicalisation *per se* with practitioners in the field. This has led to benefits for all involved. 

 **Prevent strategy evaluates complex cultural values**:  Lowe’s research impacts upon tertiary education staff by improving the way they meet their Prevent statutory duties in practice. 

 **The Police National Working Group**:  Lowe’s research impacts nationally on the Prevent policy and strategy. As a member of the Police’s Counter\-Terrorism Advisory Network, Lowe advises Police, NGO staff as well as Community Leaders on law, policy, strategy and practice governing counter\-terrorism at national and regional level. 

 *\*‘Prevent’ was introduced as part of the UK’s counter\-terrorism programme CONTEST in 2003 and education professionals are, by virtue of the <ins>Counter\-Terrorism</ins> <ins>and Security Act 2015</ins>, under a statutory duty to have due regard to the need to protect vulnerable individuals from being drawn into terrorism or any form of violent extremism.* 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Leeds Law School’s ‘Conflict, Security and International Human Rights Group’ was convened in September 2017 by Professor Gardiner to *inter alia* develop research that aims to understand the culture and communication of terrorist and extremist groups, human rights along with the law and policy underpinning these areas. 

 Lowe is a recognised expert in counter\-terrorism and has a long heritage of experience in this field.  His focus is on the rule of law in countering terrorism and protecting the security of the State and its citizens, while also protecting individual rights. In order to understand the complexity surrounding the connected research areas of how law relates to terrorism and human rights in an increasingly complex and connected globalised world, Hale\-Ross organised a symposium in 2018, with Lowe, on the state surveillance communications used by terrorists and extremists, leading to their book publication in 2019 \(3.1\). 

 In order to develop better Prevent practice, Lowe organised a further symposium in September 2019 exploring the UK’s Prevent strategy and investigating the role the law has within a wider counter\-terrorism framework.  This symposium collected together a wide range of professionals, academics and educational practitioners from the field to discuss training and educational innovation to improve Prevent in practice. 

 Presentations delivered at the symposium left an indelible impression with those attending and papers presented were published as an edited collection by Lowe and Bennett in 2020. \(3.6\). 

 Following this Prevent symposium, Lowe and the Assistant CEO of the New Bridge Group of schools in Oldham, Greater Manchester, set up an Assessment Support Centre with Oldham and Tameside Local Authorities for young people deemed at risk of exclusion.  The New Bridge Group’s Assistant CEO and Lowe studied the position and policy related to these young people to determine whether they were receiving sufficient support post assessment.  The research showed those studied possessed a lack of understanding on the laws of freedom of expression and hate crime.  Lowe’s experiences within this Assessment centre led into the research journey of 3.3. 

 **Prevent Education and Immersive Learning** 

 Initially assessing the effectiveness of HE and FE Prevent training, Lowe’s research primarily in 3.6 and indicated in earlier research, 3.4, found that education staff and students were suspicious of the Prevent duty, suspicion that was based on a misunderstanding of the aims of strategy and the rationale behind it.  Research into existing Prevent training concluded it was minimalistic and the widespread 20\-minute self\-invigilated online session only provided superficial knowledge and understanding.   The research concluded \(3.6\) that more in\-depth training was required and as a direct result, a programme of practical scenario\-based immersive learning creation was designed and developed. 

 Leeds Beckett’s Hydra Suite Prevent education programme, which utilises the Hydra learning platform and integral immersive learning methodology, is a collaborative approach between experts from the Police, the Department of Education and Leeds Law School to test educative development and the complex cultural values associated with extremism.

 **Changing Prevent Education Practice** 

 Following on from the research findings \(3.6\) on the failings of current Prevent training, an immersive learning Hydra scenario was developed to take attendees through practical scenarios and guide them through a series of extremist cases highlighting the strategic aims of Prevent and emphasising the significant and deleterious repercussions should radicalisation remain undetected. 

 This multi\-agency project has and will continue to influence directly those in HE and FE who are under a statutory duty to prevent vulnerable students from being radicalised and drawn towards terrorism.  The benefits of the Hydra training lie in showing that vulnerability stems from a broad spectrum of social factors ranging from general impressionability and social exclusion to political naivety.  The new training package will not only increase knowledge but will also boost staff confidence levels in meeting their statutory duty. 

  

 The HE/FE Coordinator for the Northeast of England responsible for Prevent, who works in the Counter Extremism Division within the Department for Education, and who has 22 universities within his portfolio \(5.2\), stated: 

 “*I have found Dr Lowe’s prior published works informative in my role as Prevent Regional HE/FE Coordinator both as evidence to support points I make and in increasing knowledge of Prevent related issues.”*  He also states, *“The research by Dr Lowe, building on a past research and publications by the same author, proposed a Prevent Hydra training product addressing key challenges that can contribute the Universities implementation of the Prevent duty. By making the training more widely available this benefit can be amplified.”* 

 The benefit of this programme, and underpinning research, was recognised by the former Independent Reviewer of the Government’s Prevent strategy and therefore clearly impacts at national level, Lord Alex Carlile \(5.3\) writes: 

 *‘The training is based on Dr Lowe’s academic research and in using the Hydra programme he has developed a ‘hands on’ practical scenario based training where delegates have to work through a series of practical issues they face during the session. As the Hydra training was developing, I recognised that this initiative has the potential to be an example of good practice that, when finally developed, could be used at national level to assist university Prevent co\-ordinators and academic staff in their role in Higher Education establishments, especially in relation their responsibility under section 26 Counter\-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 statutory duty on educators to prevent persons being drawn towards terrorism.* 

 Lord Carlile, went on to write “Dr Lowe will continue to be of value to the Review.” \(5.2\). 

 **Oldham’s Assessment Support Centre** 

 As stated in section 3 above, the 2019 Prevent symposium brought together academics and practitioners and, as a result, an Assessment Support Centre was created in Oldham.  Based on his research, Lowe has, since September 2020, been delivering presentations on Prevent to education staff throughout Greater Manchester to increase their knowledge and confidence in dealing with young people on extremism, freedom of expression, hate crime and actions amounting to terrorism in both FE and HE education settings.  This research will continue to evolve and impact upon future policy. 

 **Influencing, changing, and adapting law and policy governing counter terrorism at National and Regional levels** 

 Following the publication of Lowe’s research outputs, in October 2020 the National Police Co\-ordinator \(5.2\) for Prevent specifically requested Lowe’s assistance in drafting evolving future policy with national working groups.  This aimed to improve the identification of those most vulnerable to radicalisation and help develop new safeguarding approaches.  This trajectory demonstrates that Leeds Law School’s research has impact at national level in terms of both policy and practice.  As research develops, ongoing projects will ensure that policy meets the needs of the Prevent strategy’s aims in safeguarding the vulnerable from extremist ideologies and future acts of terrorism.  Lowe’s contribution will continue to impact upon wider communities of practice at both national and international level. 

 In addition to Lowe’s research developing external policy and practice, his research challenges the social and political perception of terrorism and radicalisation *,* the legal context of terrorism and security, and the term radicalisation with external practitioners at regional level.  Covering all aspects of the UK’s counter\-terrorism policy, CONTEST is a network of members from the Police, Government departments *,* community leaders, voluntary sector workers, youth workers, NGO staff and religious leaders. Lowe’s membership of this group will ensure this research will continue to have impact at regional level by increasing knowledge levels but will also increase educational staff confidence in meeting their statutory duty and continue to inform policy makers and influence practitioners in their practice as well the future adaptations of law in relation to community.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Mitra’s scholarship on new interculturalism, race and the politics of power and representation has influenced UK’s contemporary dance sector, by bringing into the public domain discussions about the field’s predominant whiteness and structural racisms. Her research has impacted the artistic practices of the British\-Bangladeshi dancer\-choreographer Akram Khan, and made Akram Khan Company’s funding policies address sectoral inequalities by committing to the mentoring and showcasing of works by emerging Black and Global Majority artists. Together with researchers from Coventry University and University of Sussex \(Dr Simon Ellis and Dr Arabella Stanger\), Dr Mitra has contributed to a fundamental change in organizational structures and policies at Independent Dance, a London based artist\-led organization, who have used their research to develop an anti\-racist vision. Dr Mitra’s individual and collaborative research has also equipped artistic practices of white dance artists to dismantle whiteness, and empowered Global Majority dance artists to centre conversations of race and racism in their own practices. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 By theorising the dance\-works of Akram Khan, a foundational British\-Asian dancer\-choreographer, through the lenses of new interculturalisms, critical race and gender theories, Dr Mitra’s research has pioneered a significant reshaping of academic language on intercultural performance, advocating for the concept of ‘new interculturalism’ as antiracist and anti\-colonial modes of artistic resistance. 

 Dr Mitra’s \(then, Senior Lecturer\) monograph analyses the relationship between Akram Khan’s complex identity\-positions as a diasporic British\-Bangladeshi man and his dance\-works through this lens of ‘new interculturalism’. She theorises his ‘new interculturalism’ through examining 7 key case studies from Khan’s career, focusing on his ground\-up minoritised subject\-driven language and reality. Dr Mitra’s research builds on existing critiques of 1980s western intercultural projects as white Euro\-centric projects of cultural appropriations. Instead, she centres Khan’s lived realities as the catalysing force behind his new interculturalism’s complex, anti\-colonial and anti\-racist aesthetics and politics \(Ref. 1\). 

 In interviews \(Ref. 2; Ref. 3\), Dr Mitra \(then, Senior Lecturer\) curates 2 conversations with Khan through which he explicitly critiques the whiteness of contemporary dance training, dance\-making and discourses, through his own lived reality in the industry. He goes on to make a case for how dance has become his resistive language to stand up against oppressive systems, normative expectations, people and ideologies. The same methodology is used in an interview with Steve Paxton, the US based dance artist to whom the form of contact improvisation is attributed, in order to examine Western\-centric notions of choreographic touch through the prism of new interculturalism as an anti\-racist politics and aesthetic. The interview focuses in part on dismantling the whiteness of contact improvisation through considering the form’s colonising impact on Black and Global Majority dancers \(Ref. 4\).Together with Arabella Stanger \(University of Sussex\), Dr Mitra critiques the structural racisms at the heart of 2 incidents that took place in 2020 in the British dance and theatre sectors, where organisations \(Bonnie Bird Choreography Fund and Equity\) accused of racist structures and policies, failed to recognise and apologise for their roles in upholding white supremacist structures in their issued public statements \(Ref. 5\). 

 **British Academy Small Grant Project ‘Contemporary Dance and Whiteness’ \(May \- December 2019\)** 

 This collaborative project with Dr Simon Ellis \(Coventry University\) and Dr Arabella Stanger \(University of Sussex\) undertook critical conversations and interviews with 3 administrators and co\-directors of Independent Dance \(ID\), the project partner, and 8 of their associated artists. The team delivered an ‘Anti\-Racist Dance Practices’ workshop alongside Dr Cristina Rosa from Roehampton University at ID in September 2019. In December 2019, Dr Mitra curated a public discussion ‘Anti\-Racist Contemporary Dance’ at ID’s Crossing Borders event, centring the works and voices of 4 Black and Global Majority dance artists and producers. 

 The project and its associated activities brought into the public domain the implicit and explicit ways in which racism operates in the British contemporary dance sector. It focused on the dominant white curriculum content that is pervasive to contemporary dance training, revealed how prejudices operate within dance studios, foregrounded the lived experiences of Black and Global Majority dancers, made visible the dominant whiteness of the field and its gate\-keepers, and generated a much\-needed conversation on the need to practice allyship amongst white dance artists and organisations.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 British contemporary dance maintains a predominantly white field of practice that upholds white US\-Europeanist aesthetics and ideologies. This is reflected at every dimension of the sector: leadership at leading contemporary dance venues, conservatoires and university dance departments; repertoire and curriculum content; choreographers and artists; critical reviewers of dance\-works. The result is a perpetuation of a white\-dominant culture and aesthetic that is responsible for racist silencing, erasures of knowledge\-systems from outside the US\-Eurocentric contexts and discriminations against Black and Global Majority dancers. Even so, the UK contemporary dance sector ignores its inherent structural racisms and inequalities through false diversity initiatives. Dr Mitra’s research actively challenges this notion and has been used to: 

1.  Influence explicit pollicisation of themes of the dance\-works of **Akram Khan** and shape his company’s policies 

1.  Shape policies and practices of the London\-based dance organisation, **Independent Dance** 

1.  Empower **Global Majority British contemporary dance artists** to centre conversations around racist and colonial legacies in their practices 

1.  Enable **white British contemporary dance artists** to challenge institutions and practices 

 **I. AKRAM KHAN** 

 Dr Mitra’s research has “given \[Khan\] a clear mandate for his own ethical position and practice” \(E2\). It has “underpinned his commitment to issues of social justice and representation, particularly… in relation to South Asian diaspora communities and their contemporary cultural practices and forms of participation” \(E2\). It has equipped Khan with the “critical language to articulate and situate race politics and critiques of empire and colonialism at the heart of \[his\] works thematically and aesthetically” \(E1\). Khan uses Dr Mitra’s research in his final solo *XENOS* \(2018\) to “call out white\-washed histories of World War 1 through placing at its centre the lives and testimonies of brown Indian colonial soldiers, who were erased from the archives” \(E1\). Through *XENOS*, he brought these lives into public memory and strengthened his “commitment to ‘dancing the archive’ of people of colour” \(E2\). 

 Khan also used “Mitra’s unpacking of the interdependency between his biography and \[his\] dance\-works” in his April 2019 television documentary for Channel 4, ‘The Curryhouse Kids.’ He articulated the experience of growing up in the explicitly racist environment of 70s/80s UK while witnessing the racism his father experienced from white customers at his Indian restaurant in Wimbledon \(E1\). 

 Dr Mitra’s research “has undoubtedly led to an organisational re\-evaluation” at Akram Khan Company \(E2\). The company is one of the most innovative dance companies globally and was, amongst others, involved in the creation of the London Olympic Games Opening Ceremony in 2012. Dr Mitra’s research has influenced the organisation’s decision to commit to “legacy projects” to “fund, mentor and showcase the works of emerging artists of colour” \(E1\) through “developing training programme” for them and curating the platform ‘Portraits in Otherness’ \(2018\) \(E2\). 

 In September 2020, Akram Khan Company curated a digital panel discussion on ‘Otherness’ titled ‘Clouds of Witnesses’, demonstrating Khan’s explicit “commitment to questions of power, race and racism within the dance sector”. Dr Mitra was invited to speak on this panel “alongside illustrious transnational panellists, African American primaballerina \[ *sic*\] Misty Copeland, British\-Muslim writer and poet Suhaiymah Manzoor\-Khan, Indian cultural and performance studies scholar Rustom Bharucha and South\-East Asian cultural activist Eddin Khoo”. Due to her long\-established histories with Akram Khan Company, Khan felt Dr Mitra was “the right conduit for connecting the company’s artistic processes with the outside world” on this panel \(E1\). 

 **II. INDEPENDENT DANCE \(ID\)** 

 Dr Mitra et al’s research project \(British Academy Grant\) for which ID, one of the UK’s leading artist development organisations, was a project partner led the organisation to undertake an internal review of existing structures and policies on racial justice. After participating in the project, ID changed its focus regarding the curation of training programmes and recruitment of artists and made the conscious decision to centre Black and Global Majority dance artists. The co\-director confirms that “ID’s Board has committed to accelerating board development and to reflecting on its own lack of diversity. The maximum number of trustees will be increased formally at our next Annual General Meeting and potential new trustees are being invited to observe the January meeting.” Furthermore, ID updated their “organisational policies, including an equity policy and an ethical fundraising policy” in 2020 \(E3\). 

 Using the research, ID has ringfenced financial resources \(GBP5,000\) for the development of anti\-racist practices through 2020, feeding directly into their next business plan and decision\-making frameworks to implement structural and creative changes. The funding is also expected to “support paying artists of colour for reflective critique of \[ID\] and structural/creative ways to address changes” \(E3\). Dr Mitra has been invited by ID to be an independent panel member for applications to their bursary scheme for an MA/MFA in Creative Practice \(2021\), which they deliver in partnership with Trinity Laban. The MA/MFAs curriculum content is also being reviewed with a commitment to diversify beyond its current Euro\-US\-centricism. 

 **III. EMPOWERING GLOBAL MAJORITY CONTEMPORARY DANCE ARTISTS** 

 Dr Mitra et al’s research \(British Academy Grant\), has empowered Jane Chan, an independent dance artist of East Asian heritage who has performed internationally and nationally, “to centre conversations around racist and colonial legacies in UK contemporary dance” in their own professional affiliations for the sector as Artistic Quality Assessor of Arts Council England \(E4\). 

 Chan has previously felt her “voice, narrative and work are regularly underrepresented, at times denied systematically by institutes” \(E4\). Her works aim to steer against such erasures and “act as catalysts, to invite as many people to a wider conversation about identity, race, collective experience and multiculturalism” \(E5\). Since taking part in the research project, Chan has felt “energised and empowered to create and seek out coalitional spaces and artistic collaborations with other East Asian dancers in the UK. This led to the creation of *Double Bill* \(2019\) with artist Sung Im Her, presented at Chisenhale Dance Space in 2019 and Brunel Arts Centre in 2020” \(E4\). 

 Chan used Dr Mitra’s research for a successful project grant application to the Arts Council in autumn 2020 to “create a platform for conversations, network support and galvanisation of the dance sector by amplifying voices of 20 independent artists of East and Southeast Asian heritage across Britain working towards an anti\-racist sector” \(E4\). Chan has also felt “empowered to call out racism and structural inequalities against Orientalist stereotyping of East Asians in UK’s dance industry, \[…\] speaking out on the additional barriers that dancers of African, Caribbean, East, Southeast, South Asian heritage and global majority face in the industry at organisations such as Sadler’s Wells” \(E4\). 

 **IV. ENCOURAGING WHITE CONTEMPORARY DANCE ARTISTS TO CHALLENGE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES** 

 Dr Mitra et al’s research \(British Academy Grant\), has influenced white dance artists and critics to examine their own white privilege in the industry and change their practices. It has led to white contemporary dancers speaking out against the field’s racisms, challenging institutional practices and contesting purist and Euro\-US\-centric understandings of dance practices \(E7; E8\). 

 The research has made dance critics conscious of the white lens through which dance criticism takes place in the UK and changed the way in which they approach dance and dance criticism. They have since “engaged in conversations with Black dance artists and artists of colour before reviewing their dance\-works” and set in motion talks with The Place, London’s contemporary dance training school which trains approximately 190 students each year, to recruit Black and Global Majority dance critics \(E7\). 

 As a result of the research, white dance artists and critics, have successfully pushed for structural change at Nottingham Contemporary, one of the largest contemporary art galleries in the UK that have provided approximately 138,000 people in the assessment period with learning programmes. The structural change includes advertising for 2 new board members of Black and Global Majority heritage, “a new internship and mentoring scheme for young people of the Black and Global Majority to gain professional experience in the cultural sector and access its networks”, and an anti\-bias training day for all staff to take place every season. Furthermore, a review of Nottingham Contemporary staff demographic is being undertaken to “reveal the intersection with roles, salaries and budget allocations” amongst other initiatives \(E8\). Likewise, dance artists have sought out funding to embed unconscious bias training into their work and hold space in their work for an increase of diverse peoples \(E6\). 

 These narratives demonstrate the impacts of Dr Mitra’s scholarship on the UK contemporary dance sector and the vital role it plays in facilitating structural change, towards its antiracist futures.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 <ins> *Relevant context*</ins>: Conclusive evidence has existed for nearly 30 years that folic acid supplementation before and in early pregnancy prevents neural tube defects \(NTD\) in the developing foetus, leading to clear recommendations for women of reproductive age worldwide. Policy in this area is however problematic because, despite a proven benefit in NTD, there are concerns that folic acid could be harmful at high levels of exposure. Research by Ulster on folic acid \(aka folate, a B vitamin\) has: 

 **I1:** directly impacted international **health policy for women of reproductive age** aimed at preventing major birth defects in their babies. 

 **I2:** provided the necessary scientific opinion to **set new dietary recommendations** across age\- and sex\-groups to benefit populations worldwide. 

 **I3:** informed the **risk\-benefit assessment underpinning food policy for folic acid\-fortification** in the UK, Ireland and New Zealand. 

 **I4:** contributed to **translating the scientific evidence** into practice for policy makers and health professionals globally, ultimately to benefit patients and consumers.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Supported by significant external funding \(> **GBP5M;** 2000\-2020\) from the Food Standards Agency, the European Commission, UKRI and industry, we have a built a dedicated, and internationally recognised, research programme focussed on folate in health and disease. 

  

 Our landmark findings showed important stability and bioavailability differences between naturally\-occurring food sources of folate and the synthetic vitamin form, folic acid \( **R3**\). We showed that, compared with folic acid \(present only in fortified foods and supplements\), the naturally\-occurring \(polyglutamylated\) forms of folate in food have poor stability under normal conditions of cooking and limited bioavailability once ingested by the body \( **R3**\). These findings, in turn, greatly limit a person’s ability to achieve optimal nutritional status of folate from natural food sources alone \( **R5**\). We showed that the addition of a low\-dose folic acid supplement to the diet can greatly enhance folate status in the blood, and in turn substantially lower homocysteine \( **R4\)**, a metabolite linked with adverse health outcomes throughout life from pregnancy to older age. Furthermore, we demonstrated that regular consumers of folic acid\-fortified foods had significantly higher blood concentrations of folate, and lower homocysteine, compared with non\-consumers \( **R5\).** 

 A policy of folic acid fortification of staple foods on a mandatory basis would ensure that the population as a whole benefited \(and not just those choosing to consume fortified foods as shown in **R5**\), but this is controversial. Our papers highlighted the beneficial effect of folic acid intervention, at doses within the dietary range, in achieving a blood folate concentration associated with the lowest risk of NTD in women of reproductive age \( **R1, R2, R5**\). We also showed that these benefits are not confined to preventing NTD, but also relevant in maintaining better health throughout the lifecycle including an effect of folic acid in lowering blood homocysteine, widely considered to be a risk factor in cardiovascular and other diseases \( **R4, R5, R6\).** Notably, we conducted a randomised dose\-finding trial of the effect of long\-term folic acid intervention in older adults, including cardiovascular disease patients, and provided novel findings showing that the dose of folic acid required for beneficial effects was much lower than previously believed, and that exposing populations to higher levels was unnecessary \( **R4**\); this paper triggered an accompanying editorial at the time of publication in the leading nutrition journal, the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,* highlighting the importance of the research. More recently, we addressed an important scientific concern related to the potential for folic acid to exert adverse biological effects in a randomised trial in pregnant women, and demonstrated that folic acid supplements taken at recommended levels throughout pregnancy does not lead to increased circulating unmetabolized folic acid in mothers or their babies \( **R2**\). 

 We have also identified important roles and interactions of the closely related B vitamins in maintaining normal folate metabolism and function throughout the lifecycle. Our papers showed that optimal folate metabolism and related health benefits require adequate nutritional status of not only folate, but also vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and riboflavin **\(R5, R6\).**  Our earlier findings showed for the first time that, once folate status is optimised, a much greater dependency on vitamin B12 emerges in order to prevent the accumulation of homocysteine \( **R6**\). Preventing elevated homocysteine in middle and older age is important as higher concentrations are linked with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular disease and dementia. Our research also identified the influence of genetic variations and new gene\-nutrient interactions in folate metabolism on disease risk, in turn leading to the discovery by Ulster of a highly novel role for riboflavin in lowering blood pressure in people with impaired folate metabolism owing to a common gene variant \( **R3**\). Our research has also informed the evidence base by identifying new roles for maternal folate nutrition in influencing offspring health beyond NTD. Recently, we provided the first evidence from a randomised trial of a beneficial effect of continued folic acid supplementation through trimesters 2 and 3 of pregnancy on cognitive performance in the child up to 7 years, with impacts for revising current folic acid recommendations in pregnancy \( **R1\).**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research by Ulster in folate/folic acid in 2000\-2020 has been instrumental in informing policy in the health and food sectors, tackling policy implementation issues and translating the evidence into practice for health professionals and policy makers, most notably concerning the prevention of spina bifida and related NTD. These birth defects occur when there is a failure of the neural tube to close properly in very early pregnancy, with devastating and lifelong implications for sufferers, their families and society. Preventing NTD is therefore an urgent priority globally, especially in Ireland where NTD rates are among the highest in the world. The impacts are thus greatest in the Island of Ireland, but have global reach and significance. Our research has underpinned impacts in 4 areas: 

 **Impact 1**: Our research findings, showing that folic acid \(in supplements and fortified food\) are beneficial in achieving optimal nutritional status of folate \( **R4, R5**\), have had significant impacts in informing health policy for women of reproductive age aimed at preventing NTD occurring during the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> week of foetal life. Notably, Ulster author Professor H McNulty was invited as one of a panel of international experts in the field to participate in the BOND project convened by the US National Institutes for Health to review folate as a priority nutrient. The outcome of the panel’s research \(in 2014\-2015\) was an extensive report \( **R3**\), widely considered a state\-of\-the\-art review of all aspects of folate biology and biomarkers, and which has proven to be highly applicable for international health policy and significant to policy makers. This, and our other research outputs, have directly impacted public health policy to prevent NTDs in countries worldwide: Ireland in 2016 \( **C1: R3**\), the UK in 2017 \( **C2: R2**\), New Zealand in 2018 \( **C3: R2, R3**\). 

 **Impact 2**: Our underpinning research has also informed the evidence base to support other roles for folate throughout the lifecycle from pregnancy through to older age, and thus contributed to generating dietary recommendations for folate intake within populations worldwide. Our reports of beneficial effects of folate and related B vitamins \(B12, B6 and riboflavin\) in reducing homocysteine concentrations \( **R4, R5, R6**\), highlighted the potential for these vitamins to protect against diseases of ageing, such as stroke, heart disease and cognitive decline. This research has provided valuable scientific evidence required to set new dietary folate recommendations across age and sex groups for population health, directly impacting policy in this area in European countries by providing the European Food Safety Authority \(EFSA\) with the necessary scientific opinion on dietary reference values for folate in 2014 \( **C4: R4**\). 

 **Impact 3**: Research at Ulster has informed the risk\-benefit assessment underpinning food policy for folic acid\-fortification under discussion in the UK and Ireland. Mandatory folic acid\-fortification of staple foods, aimed at reducing pregnancies affected by NTD, is now in place in over 85 countries worldwide \(including North America and Australia\), but this policy has not yet been implemented in the UK, Ireland or elsewhere in Europe. Our papers, reporting on benefits **\(R1, R4, R5, R6**\) and potential risks **\(R2, R4\)** of this population\-based intervention **,** have provided greater understanding of the risks and the benefits, pivotal to bringing policy discussions to a successful conclusion. Our paper reporting on a dose\-finding trial, showing that the dose of folic acid required for beneficial effects was much lower than previously believed \( **R4**\), was selected for inclusion in the American Society of Nutrition’s *Best of Nutrition* compilation of papers, selected by experts for “ *their impact in addressing evidence\-based issues of our day in food, diet and health*”. Our recent randomised trial evidence \( **R2**\) addressed a major health concern for policy makers, by showing that exposure to supplemental folic acid at recommended levels during pregnancy had no adverse metabolic effects in mothers or their babies. In this way our research outputs have informed international health and food regulatory authorities in relation to folic acid fortification policy: Ireland in 2016 \( **C1: R3**\), the UK in 2017 \( **C2: R2**\) and New Zealand in 2018 \( **C3: R2, R3**\). 

 **Impact 4:**  Our research was pivotal in disseminating the scientific evidence by showing how optimal folate status can be achieved in practice in patients and consumers \( **R2**, **R4, R5**\), so that the necessary public health policy could be effectively implemented \( **C1, C2, C3**\) in order to ensure that women and their families \(main beneficiaries\) could benefit. Notably, Professor H McNulty chaired the Folic Acid Review Committee at the Food Safety Authority of Ireland \(2014\-2016\), the outcome of which was an extensive policy document *Folic Acid and the Prevention of Birth Defects in Ireland* **\(C1\).** We have also contributed to translating evidence into practice guidelines for health professionals internationally in order to ensure that the patients they care for can benefit: Position Statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society in 2016 **\(C5\)**; Professional Factsheet from the National institutes for Health USA in 2019 \( **C6**\). Finally, as a pathway to impact to reach relevant users of the research and stakeholders beyond academia **,** Ulster contributed invited speaker \(H McNulty\) presentations to translate the science for health professionals and government bodies at numerous international conferences and workshops \(2014\-2020\), in North America, Australia and Europe, as well as in Ireland and the UK; the latter included a presentation delivered in the House of Commons in 2017, at the All‐Party Parliamentary Group on Health.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Fundamental research into the behaviour of particles suspended in liquids by Lancaster University \(LU\) researchers has resulted in a number of applications in an industrial context with wide ranging impacts. These include impacts through two companies and related Knowledge Transfer Partnerships \(KTPs\): 

 **Process Instruments \(PI\):** A new sensor for monitoring suspended solids in wastewater was developed as part of a KTP and applied research by LU researchers, leading to two new products \(SoliSense® and TurbSense®\) manufactured by a specialist manufacturing company, called PI. These sensors have the highest specification in terms of range and linearity of any similar commercial sensors worldwide. Since their launch in 2018, sales of over **660 sensors** have exceeded **GBP620,000**. 

 **Crown Paints:** LU researchers have engaged in applied research to help Crown Paints reduce waste production from its paint manufacturing process at its Darwen and Hull plants, **affecting millions of litres of paint it produces across both sites each week**. Impacts include: 

1.  **GBP113,000** per annum saved in the cost of reagents used to remove paint particles from the wastewater they produce across its operations at its Darwen and Hull plants \( **totalling 30,000 tonnes annually**\). 

1.  **GBP145,000** invested in the construction and commissioning of a new waste paint processing plant at their Darwen and Hull manufacturing sites, following the recommendations of the KTP project between Crown Paints and Lancaster University. This includes investment in the enhancement of water metering throughout the Darwin manufacturing site, which has enabled a full inventory of water usage and the optimisation of wastewater treatment. 

1.  Analysis by LU of magnolia matt emulsion paint produced using recycled water, rather than clean water, showed no adverse effects in terms of colour and opacity and is being adopted into their manufacturing process. 

1.  A new robust model that provides extensive analysis of the dewatering filtration process, yielding the vital physico\-chemical parameters of yield stress and diffusivity for the solid waste “cake” produced \[3.5\]. 

1.  Paint surface analysis using the SEM/EDX at LU has led to a new technique to assist future R&D approaches to paint formulation and to the diagnosis of mechanisms of paint failure. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The amelioration and disposal of wastewater streams is one of the most frequently used industrial processes in the world. For the paints industry, it is a significant source of cost, meaning all companies are seeking to optimise existing processes; waste disposal processes are also under intense scrutiny from an environental perspective, making the process of wastewater from the paint industry an essential focal point for applied research at LU. 

 Fielden has specialised in the development of chemical sensing systems for industrial applications. He has also researched more recently into ultrasonic\-based techniques for efficient removal of suspended particles in water \[3.1\]; and the potential for electrochemical removal of dyestuffs from wastewater \[3.2, 3.3\]. The applications of the novel light\-scattering sensor technology to wastewater monitoring as part of the KTP \[G2\] programme with Process Instruments Ltd, provided detailed insight into monitoring and control systems for treating particle\-laden wastewater, including paint waste. 

 Martin is an experienced chemical engineer split between industry \(15 years in commodity chemicals and water\) and academia. During his career, he has worked on solid\-liquid separations for systems as diverse as water treatment, mineral “slimes” dumps and antiperspirant specialising in the development of rigorous design methods \[3.4\], techniques for modelling and optimising systems\) 

#  Applications to partner projects 

 This Impact Case Study concerns three research projects that address the monitoring of suspended solids in treatment of wastewater \(Process Instruments\); a move towards a circular economy with paint waste \(Nimtech\); and the elimination of waste in paint manufacture \(Crown Paints\). The three projects are linked, as the preliminary feasibility study with Nimtech \(“Paint Loop” MRes joint funded by Nimtech \(GBP30,000\) and the Centre for Global Eco\-innovation \(CGE\) at Lancaster University \(LU\)\) was based at Crown Paints \(Darwen site\) who provided the source of paint waste. This encouraged Crown Paints to engage in a more substantial programme with LU \[G1\] A parallel programme between LU and Process Instruments \[G2\] developed a sensing platform for monitoring suspended solids in wastewater. The technical knowledge of PI concerning the dosing of particle\-laden waste with aluminium sulfate and polyclay, led to sharing of their understanding and best practice with the Crown Paints project, through the common project principal investigator \(Fielden\). 

 This combined expertise of Fielden and Martin, along with an earlier feasibility study on paint waste with Nimtech Ltd \(Fielden as Principal Investigator, Wardrop as the RA\), where Crown Paints Ltd were the third\-party collaborator, catalysed Crown Paints \(Darwin, Lancashire\) to enter a partnership funded through a KTP grant \[G1\] \(Fielden as Principal Investigator, Martin as Co. Investigator, and Wardrop as RA\). **This was the first research grant between Crown Paints and LU, and indeed, the first major grant\-funded research partnership between Crown Paints and a UK university in its 250\-year history.** 

 One of the higher volume waste streams is wastewater \(effluent\) from Crown’s two manufacturing sites based at Darwen and Hull, which totals approximately 30,000 tonnes annually. Despite the huge quantities, the effluent is pre\-treated in effluent treatment plants at both sites before being piped for secondary water treatment. Crown’s effluent treatment plants also produce a by\-product from this process themselves, which although currently regarded as waste has potential value which is yet to be utilised. Our research has worked to help reduce the volume of this effluent at source, to understand the underlying chemistry of the waste treatment process leading to its optimisation and associated cost reduction, whilst investigating possible uses for the biproduct \[3.5\]. The key elements of the research carried out within the KTP project with Crown Paints include: 

1.  **The compilation of a full inventory of all water used on the Darwen site \(including a considerable component of rainwater that also ends up in the waste stream\)**: This has informed Laboratory\-based experimental investigations by Lancaster University researchers, including: chemical analysis of small\-scale paint formulation and recycling of the recovered water into the primary paint production, revealing that recycled water did not adversely affect the properties of the paint: using magnolia matt emulsion paint \(the company’s highest\-volume product\), colour and opacity tests **showed an insignificant change to the optical properties of the paint formulated with recycled water.** Findings published in \[3.5\] 

1.  **The investigation of possible alternative dewatering technologies**: Apart from the filter press, which is currently used, centrifugation was considered as a possible alternative. \(Initially, ultrasound precipitation \[3.1\] was also considered, but measurement of the particle size distribution in typical paint waste ruled this out\). No other technologies came near to the filter press or centrifugation in a literature and patent review conducted by Lancaster University. 

1.  Pilot laboratory studies into the electrochemical removal of paint dyes from wastewater \[3.2; 3.3\] were carried out on dilute solutions of dyes used in the colouration of Crown’s paint products, followed by direct electrochemical processing of dye\-laden paint wastewater. Whilst the results demonstrated some reduction in the dye components, the process was not sufficiently efficient to warrant further investigation or scale\-up. 

1.  **An analysis/optimisation of the chemistry of the coagulation/flocculation process, to reduce waste and improve efficiency**: The optimisation research identified a much ‘leaner’ combination of aluminium sulfate and polyclay provided the desired coagulation/ flocculation \[3.5\]. This element of research was underpinned by expertise from Process Instruments, who provided comprehensive technical information of the underlying chemistry of aluminium sulfate\-based coagulation, and its control for the removal of particulate matter from wastewater. **This was the major research study of the KTP programme.** It led to the construction of a laboratory\-scale “mimic” of the filter press system, with an added automatic and programmable control for the pressure\-applied piston, which forces the flocculated waste within a cylindrical chamber through a circle of the same filtration membrane material used in the full\-scale filter press. The laboratory instrument also recorded the linear progression of the piston in the cylinder, as the flocculated waste was dewatered at constant, or programmed, applied pressure. The pressure, linear displacement, and time data were then analysed by a new model developed as part of the project. This model demonstrated the efficacy of the scaled down filter press mimic and led to the provision of vital physico\-chemical parameters that revealed how different formulations of the reagents would influence the “yield stress” and “diffusivity” of the solid waste “cake” formation. Three principal formulations of low, medium and high polyclay dosing have been described in the associated publication \[3.5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

#  4.1 Design and introduction of novel technologies for the measurement of suspended solids in liquids and its commercial uptake – Process Instruments 

 Process Instruments \(PI\) Ltd are a SME who specialise in the measurement and control of water disinfection \(potable and swimming pools\), and the measurement and control of particle removal from potable and wastewater through coagulation and flocculation methodology.  The desire to manufacture their own particle sensors, instead of relying on other commercially available devices from third\-party suppliers Stemmed from the fact that, prior to the KTP programme with Lancaster University, there was no single sensor on the market that could span the range of 2NTU to 8% particle concentration; two separate sensors were required to achieve the same effect. 

 Optimisation of the chemistry of the coagulation and flocculation processes by Lancaster University \[3.5\] within the KTP programme, led by Fielden, resulted in the successful development of a particle sensor that could monitor the range of 2 NTU to 8% particle concentration, with **significantly superior stability, linearity and dynamic range** compared with any current commercially available particle sensor for deployment in both potable and waste waters. This enabled PI to launch **two new products**: SoliSense® \[5.1\] and Turbsense® \[5.2\].  Turbsense® is a further variant of the SoliSense® device, which has given Process Instruments a sensor design that covers extremely low concentrations of particles in water \(0 to 10NTU\). The sensor designs are very similar but adjusted for very low particle concentrations and combined with a specialised water sampling device \(developed internally by Process Instruments as a follow\-on to the KTP project\) to eliminate the errors associated with micro\-bubbles. 

 SoliSense has the greatest dynamic range of any commercial particle sensor and is a **unique selling point,** since third\-party end users only need to purchase a single sensor, which reduces both initial cost and halves maintenance costs thereafter. Furthermore, the linearity of the sensor developed through \[G2\] has enabled the subsequent development of a **novel patented algorithm** \[5.3\] that fully compensates for drift, which is a significant problem with conventional suspended solids sensors. Since their launch in 2018, both SoliSense® and Turbsense® are **manufactured by PI at their Burnley factory**, and have sold **over 660 sensors with sales exceeding GBP620,000 to end users in 24 countries** \[5.4\]. 

#  4.2 Improved awareness and understanding of waste generation in paint manufacture resulting in changes in practice and process at Crown Paints 

 The partnership between Lancaster University researchers and Crown Paints was initially motivated by the company’s ambition to reduce the waste it generated as part of the paint manufacturing process, with the goal of becoming a net\-zero waste paint manufacturer \[5.5i\-ii\]. **New water metering systems were installed** at critical points in the manufacturing plant to gain the first accurate inventory of clean water usage and wastewater generation. This inventory enabled a **clearer understanding of the origins and volumes of the paint waste streams**, and the frequency of their generation throughout a production cycle and over the calendar year. The findings showed that Crown generated around **30,000 tonnes of wastewater** \(effluent\), and **120 tonnes of waste paint** per year \[5.5i\]. 

 Initial research focussed on the chemistry of particle removal from paint waste, through the addition of the key reagents of aluminium sulfate and polyclay, and on the importance of pH control. This research was carried out using a jar test in the Crown Paints analytical development laboratory. **The understanding of how reagent dosing influenced the flocculation of the particulate waste was assisted through technical advice and drew on equipment provided by Process Instruments** \[5.4\]. This important link between the companies was inaugurated by Fielden, as Principal Investigator to both research programmes, who realised the potential benefits to the Crown Paints project of the more effective particle\-sensing technology developed by PI. 

 This detailed understanding allowed trials and optimisation of a modified dosing chemistry to be carried out \(in particular, determination of the minimum amounts required of aluminium sulfate and polyclay to deliver efficient flocculation\) within the treatment plants at Darwen and Hull. Consequently, **the dosing chemistry practices were changed at both Darwen and Hull \(affecting over a million litres of paint manufactured each week across the two sites\) based on the KTP studies, grounded in the technical expertise provided by Process Instruments and the research expertise of Fielden and Martin from Lancaster University, which has given an annual saving in reagent costs of GBP113,000 pa.** \[5.6\]. This may be broken down into Darwen: \(GBP20,000 pa caustic washings; GBP10,000 pa polymer washings; GBP5,000 pa in lower polyclay dosing; GBP18,000 pa in the reduction of plant washing due to increased process efficiency\) and Hull: \(GBP40,000 pa in reduced polyclay and aluminium sulfate consumption due to optimisation of the reagent formulation in waste filter cake generation\). 

#  4.3 Fundamental research into the optimisation of the flocculation chemistry and the improved efficiency of dewatering by filter press. 

 Novel benchtop apparatus, designed and constructed by Fielden and Martin, allowed for systematic research by Crown and Lancaster University into the interplay between the reagent chemistry and a range of particle\-laden paint waste from representative streams at the Darwen and Hull plants\). This apparatus provided detailed data of the dewatering process, which led to the development of a mathematical model that could evaluate the compression data to yield the key physicochemical parameters of yield stress and diffusivity of the solid “cake” waste generated by the dewatering process \[3.5\]. The outcome of this fundamental research was an optimised formulation for the Crown Paints Effluent Treatment Plants. 

 Thanks to the insights granted by the benchtop test apparatus, alternative dewatering processes were considered as part of the KTP programme, including ultrasonic sedimentation and centrifugation. Centrifugation was considered the closest competitor to the filter press, which resulted in a 6\-month evaluation of a pilot centrifuge system by Crown at their Darwen site. This study showed that the filter press was the most efficient dewatering technology for the removal of particulates from paint waste. Subsequently, **the wastewater treatment plant at the Darwen site was renewed at a cost of GBP55,000, and at the Hull site for GBP70,000 to reflect the outcome of the main element of the KTP programme** \[5.6\]. 

#  4.4 Applied research into the recycling of solid paint waste leading to a reduction is waste production 

 Another project investigated both the recycling of the paint waste “cake” generated by the filter press and the water filtrate. The cake waste is currently sent to landfill but has been shown through the KTP programme to have applications as a “bulking” agent in the manufacture of external masonry paint, which is being acted on by the company to *“to realise the economic and environmental benefits”* \[5.5i\-ii\]. Laboratory\-scale research showed that recycled water from the filter press process could be used in the manufacture of magnolia paint \(the major paint type manufactured by the company\) without detrimental effects on the paint colour and opacity. This finding has already shaped Crown’s knowledge of the process, has helped to reduce waste production in the paint manufacturing of particular products, and is being rolled out across Crown’s large\-scale, complex manufacturing process which includes over a million litres of paint produced weekly \[5.5i\-ii\] and \[5.6\]. 

 **Unplanned in the original KTP programme, it became apparent that the partnership between Crown and Lancaster University could also benefit the company through access to specialist equipment at the Chemistry Department at LU.** Specifically, the polymer development scientists benefitted from access to our Field\-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope \(Jeol JSM\-7800F plus Oxford Instruments Xmax\-50 EDS\) with which they were able to evaluate novel emulsion paint formulations for the structure of the emulsion and the distribution of fillers, such as TiO<sub>2</sub> \[5.6\]. Whilst it is difficult to quantify this element of impact, **the findings have been presented to the parent Hempel Group** by Craig Wood, and represent a **new approach to the evaluation of future paint formulations, referenced in recent company reports as having, and the diagnosis of the failure of paint formulations** \[5.5ii and 5.6\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Following a decade of spending cuts, grassroots open youth work \(youth clubs, street\-based and online youth work\) has faced significant challenges. In providing an evidence base for the value of youth work and more youth\-centred evaluation practices, research led by Dr Tania de St Croix at King’s College London has contributed to new investment in the sector and prompted change to accountability and evaluation policies and practices. Further, the research has bolstered youth\-centred developments in the daily practice of open youth work and the training of professional and volunteer youth workers, ultimately benefitting some of society’s most marginalised young people. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A decade of substantial cuts to youth work provision across the UK has resulted in the depletion of a resource that is open to young people by choice, engages with them on their terms, and attracts marginalised young people who are less likely to access mainstream services. At the same time, there has been an increasing policy emphasis on assessing youth services through predetermined, measurable outcomes. Two research studies led by de St Croix have examined the impact of these developments on grassroots open youth work; that is youth work that takes place in youth clubs, street\-based youth work, and youth work with specific groups \(eg young women, young refugees, black young people, LGBTQ young people, or disabled young people\). Specifically, the research has documented practitioners’ and young people’s perspectives and experiences, highlighting, mapping and analysing how a combination of austerity and the increased use of outcome\-based monitoring procedures has transformed practice \[1,2,3,4\] and is threatening the long\-term future of youth work \[5\]. The research has also identified existing good practice in evaluation and articulated the case for more youth\-centred qualitative techniques \[5\] and grassroots narrative methods \[6\] that are more congruent with the values of youth work. 

#  Grassroots youth work practice in a changing policy context 

 Through policy analyses, participant observation and in\-depth qualitative interviews and focus groups with 35 youth workers, the first study, published as a monograph, *Grassroots youth work: Policy, passion and resistance in practice*, showed how part\-time and volunteer youth workers, who work directly with young people facing complex and challenging circumstances, are themselves marginalised in decision\-making relating to policy and practice \[1\]. The research also illuminated the ways in which target cultures have distorted their practice by, for example, requiring formal evaluation methods \(such as form\-filling and database tracking\). This has made it more difficult for them to develop person\-centred, trusting relationships with young people who are inclined to be suspicious of formal measurement and intrusive tracking mechanisms \[2\]. In a co\-authored paper with Ian McGimpsey from the University of Birmingham, researchers at King’s have conceptualised these changes as being informed by neoliberal logic, resulting in services and projects being ranked and compared according to their economic outcomes \[3\]. This contrasts with a tradition of youth work that is based on a commitment to critical dialogue with young people and the creation of informal education opportunities that start from young people’s agendas \[4\]. 

#  The value and evaluation of youth work 

 A follow\-up study, funded by the ESRC, ‘Rethinking Impact, Evaluation and Accountability in Youth Work’ \[7\] examined how evaluation and accountability mechanisms are used in youth work, how young people and practitioners conceptualise the value of youth work and what approaches to evaluation and accountability are most appropriate in relation to practice. Qualitative data collection comprised participant observation in a variety of youth work settings in five regions across England \(including urban and rural areas with varied demographics\) alongside in\-depth interviews, focus groups and youth participatory research with 140 young people, practitioners, managers and policy influencers. The study took place in a policy context in which youth organisations were encouraged by government \(through the Centre for Youth Impact, see section 4\) and funding agencies to prove their effectiveness through outcomes measurement. Conventional outcomes measurement approaches are problematic in youth work settings because they determine efficacy on the basis of predefined, discrete outcomes, whereas in youth work, there is no specific beginning or end and diverse needs may only emerge during the process of engagement. 

 The study generated new understandings and articulations of how youth work makes a vital contribution to young people’s everyday lives in the here and now, by providing an in\-depth analysis of the value and importance of providing trusted relationships, safe yet informal spaces, and critical conversations around personal challenges and wider social issues \[5\]. The research has, in addition, revealed and unpacked the ways in which evaluation and monitoring practices are experienced by young people and youth workers as inappropriate: intrusive, time\-consuming, overly formal, impractical; and as reinforcing adult\-defined deficit narratives about young people \[5\]. The research has shown how, in contrast, young people and youth workers value accountability mechanisms that are rooted in practice, are sensitive to the complexities of young people’s lives and avoid deficit labels \[5\]. 

 The research has also identified and illuminated the problematic ways in which outcomes measurement shapes overall provision towards short\-term targeted projects and away from long\-term open provision \[5\]. This is intensified by what de St Croix, with colleagues from King’s and the University of Birmingham, have named a ‘social investment machine’, in which evaluation techniques developed within and outside government attribute a financial value to outcomes and services, further disadvantaging practices that are less amenable to this kind of evaluation \[3\]. 

 To address the need for a more equitable, nuanced approach to accountability that reflects the complexities of practice and the skilled nature of youth work, the research has made the case for, and recommended, mixed qualitative evaluation processes \(comprising, for example, interviews, focus groups, storytelling and creative methods\) and the greater involvement of young people and practitioners in decisions about evaluation and accountability \[5,6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In the largely practice\-based field of youth work, the research has provided an evidence base for reforms to funding, policy and practice. The research impact is rooted in a collaborative approach, based on de St Croix’s lengthy professional experience in the field, and extensive engagement with young people, youth workers and policy makers/influencers throughout the research process \(planning, data collection and engagement/dissemination\). Research findings are shared in a variety of accessible formats including policy briefings, blog posts, workshops at professional conferences and creative methods such as film. 

#  Strengthening the case for new investment 

 In the context of spending cuts that have disproportionately affected grassroots open youth work, de St Croix’s research \[1,4\] has helped to articulate the case for further youth work investment and amplify the voices of young people and youth workers calling for increased funding and more responsive systems of support at local and national levels of government. For example, the Chair of the Institute for Youth Work \(the professional association for youth workers in England\) has commented that: “We as youth workers have been empowered by Dr de St Croix’s research to push back against commissioners… Dr de St Croix’s work speaks to the frame of reference that youth workers need in order to inform the agency they have in such a system” \[A\]. 

 De St Croix’s research documenting and conceptualising the value of open youth work \[1\] was also used by the 2019 All Party Parliamentary Group on Youth Affairs as evidence of the highly skilled role played by youth workers in providing young people with trusted relationships, safe spaces and stimulating activities \[B1 p.19\]. Three months after its publication in April 2019, the APPG report prompted a general debate in the House of Commons on the current sufficiency of youth services, in which new funding, including GBP500,000 in bursaries for up to 400 youth work students, was announced \[B2\]. 

 **Informing policy: reframing accountability and evaluation in youth work** 

 By providing evidence of the harmful effects of the policy emphasis on target cultures and outcomes measurement and demonstrating and articulating the value of alternative ways of conceptualising and practising accountability in youth work, the research \[5,6\] has directly contributed to moves towards more youth\-centred approaches that are more in keeping with the philosophy of youth work. 

 For example, de St Croix has worked in partnership with the Centre for Youth Impact, which was set up by the Cabinet Office in 2014 to encourage impact measurement in youth organisations and which works collaboratively with practitioners, funders and policymakers to improve services and support for young people across the UK. Influenced by the research \[2,5\] and through a ‘critical friend’ relationship with de St Croix \(including regular meetings, mutual advice and invitations to speak at events and contribute to essay and blog series\), the Centre for Youth Impact has moved away from recommending standardised outcome\-based measurement approaches in youth work towards an approach that is more sensitive to, and better aligned with, the traditional values and practices of youth work \[C1 p.18\]. The Centre for Youth Impact has put this change into practice in their commissioned evaluation of one of the biggest investments in open access youth provision in recent years, the 2017\-20 Youth Investment Fund \[C2 p.2,4\] \(a joint investment between the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and The National Lottery Community Fund of GBP40,000,000 to support voluntary, community and social enterprise youth organisations to deliver, expand and create high quality local youth provision in targeted communities across England\). Rather than imposing a model of evaluation from outside and restricting the evaluation to outcomes measures, they have taken a participatory approach \(working in collaboration with youth organisations\) and have focused on young people’s feedback and indicators of quality practice, both of which were absent from government\-funded youth work monitoring and evaluation in the past. The CEO of the Centre for Youth Impact, commenting on de St Croix’s influence on the Centre’s thinking and practice, has noted that the continuation and responsiveness of its work is due in large part to de St Croix’s research: “If we had kept trying to push out some of the ways of working that Tania critiques, we wouldn't have been around…\[T\]he fact that we have integrated so much of the kind of thinking that Tania represents – and tried to walk a sensitive and thoughtful line – is the reason why we exist” \[D\]. 

 Insights from the research also fed into the development of Labour Party policy ahead of the 2019 general election, through de St Croix working closely with the Political Advisor to the Shadow Youth Minister, giving advice on issues including: the distinctive contribution of grassroots open youth work; training and workforce development; challenges and opportunities in scaling up youth work after a period of under\-investment; and the need for appropriate evaluation and monitoring. By identifying the danger of tying funding to quantitative outcomes, in contrast to previous Labour policy, Labour’s \(2019\) *Only Young Once* policy paper and its subsequent 2019 manifesto committed to reversing the funding cuts and moving towards longer\-term, contextually\-sensitive forms of evaluation \[E1\]. As acknowledged by the Political Advisor to the Shadow Youth Minister “\[de St Croix’s\] research on accountability and evaluation processes in youth work and her informal feedback helped shape Labour’s policy positions on youth work evaluation and contributed to wider youth policy development…\[H\] *er expertise played an important role in shaping Labour’s commitment outlined in the Only Young Once Report to move towards stronger, more effective evidence of youth work that focuses on the long term, moving away from previous attempts to tie quantitative measures around outcomes and impact of universal youth work.* Following the publication of this report, Labour at the 2019 General Election committed to build a statutory youth service that focused on non\-formal learning and ensured all young people have access to high quality youth work provision that matches their needs” \[E2\]. 

 In addition, the research findings have provided youth workers and organisations with an evidence\-based rationale for more qualitative, youth\-centred approaches to evaluation. Practitioners \(youth workers, managers and evaluators in local government, charities and social enterprises\) have widely engaged with King’s research on youth work, including academic articles \[especially 1,2,5\], blogs, essays and talks at practitioner events, and de St Croix has held meetings with over 25 organisations rethinking their approach to evaluation. This influence on practice has been recognised by the National Youth Agency – the national body for youth work in England, with wider influence internationally – which works with youth work providers to champion youth work and raise its profile among policymakers, educators and employers; train youth workers and offer accreditation; and further facilitate youth work by arranging collaboration and funding with commercial and public sector partners. The National Youth Agency’s Research and Learning Manager has acknowledged the importance of de St Croix’s research and its strong impact focus, commenting that: “de St Croix’s work helps organisations think about the implications of their practice and evaluation processes in a way that considers the practical context within which youth work operates, but places individual young persons at the centre of the process … \[I\]t improves the overall outcome for young people by ensuring their needs are understood as the most important element in the youth work process, and \[shows\] that… sometimes the ‘everyday’ contribution that youth work makes in young people’s lives is just as valuable as the ‘extraordinary.’ … \[H\]er mixed methodologies fill a significant gap in evaluation processes… She is regularly referenced in our advocacy reports due to the strong empirical evidence her work provides… We regularly consult with Dr de St Croix’s on various matters that concern the youth sector” \[F\]. 

#  **Pioneering new approaches to practice** 

 To embed research findings \[5,6\] in youth work, de St Croix has collaborated with charities and practitioners’ groups to develop and share alternative evaluation tools. For example, in 2020 she worked with London Youth \(a London\-based network of 650 community youth organisations\) to deliver training in qualitative interviewing for youth workers, to enable practitioners to build their skills and confidence in using qualitative research methods for evaluation. De St Croix also worked as part of In Defence of Youth Work \(a grassroots practitioners’ forum\) to devise and implement a radically different approach to conventional quantitative evaluation – a qualitative and reflexive storytelling methodology. The storytelling workshop method has been used for practice development, critical professional reflection and accountability purposes by local government and third sector organisations. The approach has been shared through workshops involving 1416 participants across nine countries, and resources to run the workshop have been made available on an opensource website aimed at practitioners \[G\]. The workshops were developed as a form of resistance to the dominance of neoliberal outcomes measurement in youth work, as theorised by researchers including de St Croix \[4\], and their adaptation as a form of qualitative evaluation draws on de St Croix’s articulation of the value of alternative evaluation methodologies and her research on the importance of democratic accountability \[2,6\]. 

 The storytelling resource has had an impact on practice internationally. For example, a research team at Hosei University, Tokyo, who have researched the impact of youth work in Europe in order to develop youth work practice in Japan, have taken a particular interest in the storytelling methodology and invited de St Croix and a practitioner to Japan in 2019 to lead seminars with over 200 practitioners and local policy makers. The professor who led this project has acknowledged the use of this storytelling approach in Japanese youth work and described how de St Croix’s work has “helped to develop local practice and highlight ways of communicating what youth work can achieve” \[H\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 City, University of London’s Research Cluster on international crisis reporting has had deep reach in international news organisations and UK regulatory and diplomatic bodies, changing journalistic and professional practice and editorial policy to the benefit of practitioners, media managers, NGOs, funders, audiences, and ultimately those in need of humanitarian support. The research presented here has: 1\) supported editorial policy changes at The New Humanitarian, the world’s oldest specialist humanitarian news outlet, resulting in a transformation of the content available to the humanitarian sector globally; 2\) shaped Ofcom regulatory decisions in the UK and improved journalistic practice globally to reduce hate speech and harmful stereotypes, and 3\) changed understanding of strategic communications for Defence Attachés, military experts attached to British embassies, furthering the UK’s National Security Objectives.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 City, University of London’s \(City\) International Journalism Research Cluster has created new knowledge and practice relating to the production, content, and influence of international crisis reporting \(ICR\). The group of nine scholars, all experienced journalists, use interviews, content analysis, newsroom ethnography, audience surveys, and discourse analysis in their research. Here we report the work of three scholars in the cluster. 

 **2.1 Foundation funded reporting** 

 Dr Mel Bunce researches the production and content of ICR, often with her long\-standing collaborators Drs Scott \(UEA\) and Wright \(Edinburgh\); equal co\-authors, they take turns as lead authors. International news coverage plays a key role in raising awareness of humanitarian crises yet, due to the high costs involved, few outlets regularly produce original coverage. In a major AHRC\-funded study **\[3.8\]** of English language reporting on humanitarian issues, Bunce and co\-authors analysed the outputs of more than 20,000 news outlets and found that only 12 organisations routinely produced original reports on humanitarian issues – almost all of them relying on support from states or private foundations to explain the complex causes of such crises. **\[3.1, p. 1\]** The report presented a close textual analysis of reporting undertaken by news outlets \(including The New Humanitarian\) on specific humanitarian issues/events in Nepal, Yemen, and South Sudan. This showed that there was generally very limited reporting on the environment, gender, and health and that most outlets relied heavily on western sources, rather than affected citizens and local experts. **\[3.1\]** The research findings led to changes in editorial policy at The New Humanitarian which resulted in better quality content for the humanitarian sector. A wider study involving 32 organisations \(foundations, intermediaries, non\-profit news outlets\) found that foundations are changing the role and contribution of journalism. While foundations did not try directly to influence content, they incentivised journalists to focus on topics aligned with their priorities. **\[3.2\]** Recent unpublished research investigates how democratic governments’ allocations of humanitarian aid are influenced by ICR and finds that sudden\-onset, national news coverage can increase levels of emergency humanitarian aid. **\[5.4\]** 

 **2.2 Reporting the Middle East** 

 Dr Zahera Harb’s 11 years as a reporter in Lebanon informs her research on the reporting of Middle Eastern crises by international and local media. She shows how Western media representations of countries in crisis often reinforce stereotypes of the country and its people. In 2015 she reviewed British media stories of women’s lives in Lebanon with high\-profile Lebanese female journalists. Participants found the coverage was simplistic and applied the ‘oppressed Muslim woman’ stereotype. Harb argues that the tendency towards generalisation and applying preconceived perceptions, especially in gender reporting, amounts to a form of Orientalist \(after Said\) news practice. **\[3.3\]** Harb was an adviser for the Ethical Journalism Network’s ‘5\-point Test for Hate Speech’ \(see 4.2\) which she used in her investigation of Arab media reporting of regional conflicts to analyse TV news on Al\-Arabiya and Al\-Jazeera, the most prominent 24\-hour news channels in the region. She identified how the channels operate in line with their sectarian political affiliations, with the language, tone, and framing of news content perpetuating divisions between religious, ethnic, and political groups. **\[3**. **4\]** These findings influenced Ofcom decisions in the UK and changed journalistic practice globally reducing hate speech and harmful stereotypes. 

 **2.3 Reporting terrorism** 

 Dr Abdullahi Tasiu Abubakar’s research investigates the ways that terror organisations such as Boko Haram \(BH\) deploy strategic communications to advance their political goals. Based on rare and extensive access to journalists who liaise with BH, analysis of media outputs, and his personal reflections as a journalist working in the region, he finds that BH’s dextrous handling of the media is a key component of their communications campaign. His review of the evolution of BH’s ‘Public Awareness Department’, which handled matters ranging from propaganda to recruitment of members, reveals how BH adapted to government counter\-insurgency activities and technological developments, moving from a ‘guerrilla’ media strategy involving secret sources to direct uploads of material to YouTube and Twitter. **\[3.5\]** In a further study Tasiu Abubakar found that BH’s attacks and atrocities were often staged to generate news interest and succeeded in securing substantial attention from Western media to the extent that BH, the organisation, could hardly be distinguished from BH, the media phenomenon. Tasiu Abubakar considers how nation states, despite success against BH on the battlefield, have often failed to advance competing credible narratives to local audiences, as trust in their messages is undermined by misinformation and use of disinformation. **\[3.6\]** These findings led to changes in training for Defence Attachés, military experts attached to British embassies worldwide. Tasiu Abubakar’s work led to further research on the challenges and ethical dilemmas of reporting violent extremism in Africa. **\[3.10\]**

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The International Journalism Cluster has improved international crisis reporting \(ICR\) by changing editorial policy, increasing news audience satisfaction, improving journalistic and professional practice, and shaping regulatory decision\-making which benefits journalists, media managers, funders, NGOs, readers, and ultimately those in need of humanitarian aid. The cluster’s research is curated and amplified by the Humanitarian News Research Network. **\[5.1\]** Founded by Bunce in 2016 and hosted at City, University of London, it has grown to a membership of over 250 journalists, NGO staff, policy makers, and researchers beyond City who aim to improve ICR. The website features original articles and a quarterly newsletter \(247 subscribers\), while the Twitter account has over 2,500 followers. The cluster also promotes its research through appointments to regulatory and industry bodies; consultancy; partnerships with news organisations, international organisations, policy makers, and NGOs; and speaking at industry and public events. 

 **4.1 Changing editorial policy and increasing the range of ICR available to audiences** 

 Bunce’s consultancy work with The New Humanitarian \(TNH, formerly IRIN\), the oldest specialist humanitarian news outlet in the world, supported changes in editorial policy which increased the range of TNH content for audiences. TNH has 375,000 unique website visitors a month and 57,000 newsletter subscribers in 190 countries. **\[5.2\]** After TNH became independent from the UN in 2015, TNH reviewed how to position themselves in the news market and how their reporting could best serve those affected by humanitarian crises. Bunce and co\-authors advised the outlet on editorial strategy based on their analysis of TNH’s news outputs, which showed a lack of health and climate change reporting and few local experts appearing in reports. **\[3**. **1\]** As a result, TNH’s new editorial strategy took on board the research findings, the Director said “Since seeing the results of their research, we have made a considered effort to increase the coverage of health and climate change, and to increase the percentage of local sources consulted as analysts and experts – not just as survivors or beneficiaries. Finally, it was a helpful confirmation of our plans to put attention and resources into investigative reporting about the humanitarian sector”. **\[5.2\]** 

 The research’s impact on TNH’s editorial strategy was evidenced by a follow\-up content analysis of TNH reporting: “Between 2015 and 2017, our coverage of ‘Weather and Climate’, increased from 2% of reports to 10%. The number of TNH stories classified as ‘investigative’ or ‘campaigning’ journalism increased from 6% to 17%. And the proportion of ‘local experts’ cited in TNH’s coverage doubled from 2% to 4%”. **\[5.2\]** The Director confirmed that these changes were welcomed by global audiences: “In our 2018 audience survey, 40% of respondents said that TNH had recently improved its investigative reporting. In addition, a significant proportion said the outlet’s coverage of health \(39%\) and climate change \(44%\) was one of the ‘most useful’ topics for their work”. **\[5.2\]** 

 The change in TNH’s reporting, for example doubling the use of local experts, is significant because it is a key information source benefitting decision\-makers in the global humanitarian sector. TNH’s 2020 audience survey found that 80% of readers had decision\-making responsibilities in international / national NGOs and government organisations. Evidencing the influence of TNH’s news, 69% of respondents said that TNH stimulated further research and/or advocacy and 24% said that TNH informed organisational and operational priorities, including the deployment of resources. **\[5.2\]** For example, following TNH’s health reporting \(September 2019\) on the potential spread of Ebola from Congo to South Sudan, the Ministry of Health contacted the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss how to further strengthen South Sudan’s overall preparedness. **\[5.3, p. 15\]** 

 In February 2020, Bunce and co\-authors presented their findings on how ICR influences aid budgets to the UN’s Humanitarian Networks and Partnerships Week in Geneva. **\[5.4a\]** The UN Assistant Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs’ closing remarks said of the research, “These findings are not only interesting – they are instrumental to inform how we approach the media moving forward. And I think we can all agree that by better understanding the role of the media, we can help make humanitarian funding more principled, efficient, effective and transparent”. **\[5.4b\]** Bunce is also an adviser to Médecins Sans Frontières and an expert witness at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in ongoing proceedings between Al Jazeera and the Egyptian Government \(Case No. ARB/16/1\) relating to alleged losses of USD 150 million of Al Jazeera’s investment due to the enforced closure of its business in Cairo and the arrest of its journalists. 

 **4.2 Reducing hate speech and harmful stereotypes in ICR** 

 Harb’s research on Middle Eastern crisis reporting has influenced how journalism is regulated in the UK and improved journalistic practice globally. Harb was a member of the Office of Communications \(Ofcom\) Content Board \(2015\-2018\), which oversees the regulation of media in the UK. The then Chair of the board said Harb “made an invaluable contribution to its work, both in providing review and oversight of Ofcom’s Content and Standards procedures and in offering wider advice and expert guidance to Ofcom as a whole… her knowledge of Middle East politics and media made her a particularly valuable member of the Ofcom team”. **\[5.5\]** Harb sat on ten special committees assessing more than 250 broadcast complaints and a fellow board member confirmed Harb’s research influenced their decision\-making, for example, in cases of hate speech or as background on who owned or controlled Middle Eastern TV channels operating in the UK. **\[5.6\]** Harb also advised Ofcom on projects relating to diversity and religious matters. 

 Since 2014, Harb has been a Trustee and Board member of the Ethical Journalism Network \(EJN\), a global coalition of 70 groups of journalists, editors, press owners, and media support groups. Harb advised on the development of professional tools to improve reporting on sensitive and inflammatory issues, such as the ‘ [5\-point Test for Hate Speech](https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/resources/infographics/5-point-test-for-hate-speech-english)’ \(2014\). **\[3.4\]** She co\-produced guidelines for reporting terrorism and countering hate speech **\[5.7\]**, an action plan on hate speech and coverage of violence for media practitioners, managers, and owners in the Caribbean **\[5.8a\]**, and  [guidelines for covering a pandemic](https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/resources/infographics/7-points-for-covering-a-pandemic) \(2020\). 

 Harb, in collaboration with UNESCO and the Public Media Alliance \(the largest global association of public service broadcasters with over 100 members\), led workshops and practical training on the EJN guidelines for editors, journalists, and media regulators in the Middle East, Caribbean \(August 2018\) **\[5.8a\]**, and South East Asia \(March 2019\). **\[5.7\]** As a result, as evidenced in formal evaluations of the workshops, participants were more aware of hate speech and gained tools to identify and prevent it. A participant from the Press Council of Indonesia said that the training “helps journalists to make ethical decisions when dealing with hate speech, violence and terrorism reporting”. **\[5.7\]** A senior representative of The Media Institute of the Caribbean, a resource and training facility for journalists and news managers, said: “I would advocate for the use of the action plan developed at the workshop” **\[5.8b\]** and the Institute has subsequently created intensive training courses on hate speech reporting. 

 In 2019 Harb secured funding from the Media Diversity Institute **\[3.9\]**, an international agency working to encourage accurate reporting and ran well\-received workshops on combatting negative stereotypes and disinformation for refugee journalists and journalists who cover refugee issues for British and international news organisations. Harb is also an expert adviser with the Thomson Foundation UK \(2007\-ongoing\) which works to develop the media industry in countries worldwide and, since September 2020, a Director of the Europe Board of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, a project of the Columbia School of Journalism which supports ethical news reporting on conflict and tragedy. 

 **4.3 Changing diplomatic understanding of strategic communications** 

 Tasiu Abubakar’s research gives Defence Attachés \(DAs\) an understanding of the local media landscape and how it can be used to their advantage. DAs are specialist military personnel attached to British embassies, involved in defence engagement activities, such as collecting intelligence and advising on military matters. This advice can form the basis of action with important geo\-political consequences. 

 In December 2016, “because of his research and expertise on how strategic communications can be deployed to advance specific goals” **\[5.9\]**, Tasiu Abubakar was invited to teach at the UK government’s Defence Academy, the post\-graduate training centre for military personnel and civilians from 98 countries. The senior officer who oversees the course describes the impact of Tasiu Abubakar’s research\-based training on DA practice in the field: “\[it\] provides our DAs with a vital point of reference for their understanding of the information environment in their new countries”. **\[5.9\]** 

 The \(DA\) Foundation Course covers all aspects of strategic communications, examining the relationship between Embassies, DAs, and the media, engagement with the host nation, and how to use communication to advance defence engagement. Tasiu Abubakar’s training sets out the role of information campaigns in terrorism and counter\-terrorism, a rapidly changing and poorly understood issue. The course is run three times a year for DAs who are about to be deployed around the world, involving over 400 participants since 2017. **\[5.9\]** The senior officer confirms “the understanding of the local media landscape and how it can be used to their advantage…is so essential for them ahead of assuming their new roles”. **\[5.9\]** 

 Due to the classified nature of the DA role, it is not possible to give specific examples of how the training has influenced defence engagement practice on the ground. However, its vital role in achieving National Security Objectives was confirmed in the UK’s International Defence Engagement Strategy \(2017\) which stated defence engagement was now a funded core ‘soft power’ task for the Armed Forces, with resources for the global network of DAs \(one of the largest in the world\), including training, of around £80 million per annum. **\[5.10, p. 12\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 We showed an association between mild\-to\-moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy and lower child cognition. We identified milk as the principal determinant of iodine status hence recent dietary shifts towards organic milk/milk\-alternative drinks which have significantly lower iodine content are problematic. 

 As a result of our work: 

-  the iodine content of the market\-leading pregnancy supplement has been increased; 

-  market\-leading milk\-alternative drinks have been fortified with iodine; 

-  the iodine content of organic milk has been increased; 

-  policy has changed to monitor UK iodine status; 

-  healthcare professionals have become aware of the importance of iodine through the information we have provided on dietary iodine through media and resources.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A major component of the thyroid hormones, iodine is vital for brain development, particularly in pregnancy. Women of childbearing age need to have adequate iodine status prior to and during pregnancy; however, data were lacking on the iodine status of the UK population. In studies between 2009 and 2011 we identified the presence of mild\-to\-moderate deficiency in pregnant women \[for example **3.1**\] and mild deficiency in women of childbearing age **\[3.2\]**. 

 Severe prenatal iodine deficiency is known to impair foetal brain development and may result in cretinism \(Zimmermann 2009 *Endocr Rev* 30, 376\-408\). However, the effects of mild\-to\-moderate deficiency in pregnancy were less well known. Using data and samples from mother\-child pairs in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children \(ALSPAC\), we were the first to show that women with mild\-to\-moderate iodine deficiency \(i.e., 67% of the cohort of 958 women\) were more likely to have children with low verbal IQ, reading accuracy and comprehension at 8\-9 years **\[3.3\]**. 

 The Recommended Nutrient Intake \(RNI\) for iodine is 150 μg/day for adults and 250 μg/day for pregnant women. Many countries use the WHO\-recommended approach of iodised salt to prevent population iodine deficiency; however, the UK has no such mandatory/voluntary policy. Although increased salt intake is discouraged, iodised salt can provide a non\-animal source of iodine. We showed that iodised salt is not widely available in the UK **\[3.4\]** and that 96% of pregnant women rarely/never used it **\[3.1\]**. At the time, the main iodised\-salt brand only provided 7.5% of the adult RNI per gram so it was unlikely to contribute meaningful quantities of iodine to the diet. 

 We found that milk intake was the strongest predictor of iodine status in our cohorts **\[3.1, 3.2\]**; data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey \(NDNS\) shows that it provides 51% and 34% of total intake for children and adults, respectively. UK cows’ milk is a good source of iodine owing to farming practices such as the use of iodine\-supplemented cattle\-feed for animal health and iodine\-containing disinfectants in the dairy industry. However, some UK consumers prefer to buy less\-intensively farmed produce, such as organic milk. We were the first to investigate the iodine concentration of organic milk in comparison with conventional milk. Our 2012 study analysed samples of organic and conventional milk purchased in 16 UK areas. The results caused concern to organic\-milk producers as the iodine concentration of organic milk was only 58% of that of cows’ milk **\[3.5\]**. 

 More recently, shifts towards plant\-based diets linked to environmental sustainability have increased sales of milk\-alternative drinks. In 2015 we analysed the iodine concentration of 47 milk\-alternative drinks \(soya, almond, coconut, oat, rice, hazelnut and hemp\) across 20 brands. Only one retail brand, not the market leader, was fortifying its soya, oat and rice drinks with iodine. The iodine concentration of the unfortified milk\-alternative drinks \(n=44\) was extremely low, at just 1·7% of the value for conventional cows' milk **\[3.6\]**. This was of concern as the consumer shift towards these milk\-alternatives is typically by young women of childbearing age, thus has the potential to increase their risk of iodine deficiency. Indeed, data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey \(NDNS; 2014\-2017\) showed that consumers of milk\-alternatives had a significantly lower iodine intake than cows’ milk consumers \(median 94 vs 129 µg/day\). Furthermore, with a significantly lower iodine status, consumers of milk\-alternative drinks were classified as iodine\-deficient by WHO criteria whereas milk consumers were iodine\-sufficient \(median urinary iodine concentration, 79 vs. 132 µg/L\) **\[3.7\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our research provided the first evidence of a significant association between mild\-to\-moderate iodine deficiency in UK pregnant women and poorer child cognition **\[3.3\]**. Inferior cognitive development can set children on a trajectory for poorer school attainment, examination grades and employment opportunities. Even a slight reduction in IQ affects population economic success and productivity \(Jones & Schneider 2006, J Econ Growth; 11:71–93\). 

 It is imperative that UK women of childbearing age maintain adequate iodine intake and that recent shifts towards consumption of organic milk or plant\-based milk\-alternatives do not have a detrimental effect on population iodine status. With the rise in popularity of plant\-based/vegan diets, non\-animal dietary sources, such as iodised salt, can also help. 

###  Impact on product formulation of plant\-based milk\-alternatives 

 As a direct result of our research **\[3.6\]**, the market leader, \{Text removed for publication\} **\[5.1\].** Furthermore, following discussions with us **\[5.2\]**, in November 2019, ‘Oatly *’* started to fortify their oat drinks with iodine and in July 2020, added iodine to their yoghurt alternative. The fortified iodine content of \{Text removed for publication\} and Oatly drinks, at 22.5 µg/100ml, supplies 30% of the adult requirement per glass, thus providing non\-dairy consumers with an iodine source. Iodine fortification by market leaders means that there is now increased accessibility to iodine\-fortified milk; prior to our publication it was only available from Marks & Spencer. Since our research was published, Marks & Spencer have also increased the iodine concentration of their plant\-based milk\-alternatives to 30 µg/100ml and have extended it to the whole range. Furthermore, since September 2020, Asda has fortified its milk\-alternative drinks, at 25\-28 µg/100ml. 

 **Beneficiaries**: consumers of milk\-alternative drinks; vegans. 

###  Impact on policy and practices in organic dairy farming 

 As a result of our publication demonstrating lower iodine concentration in organic milk **\[3.5\]**, the organic dairy industry became concerned, and in 2014 the Organic Milk Suppliers Co\-operative \(OMSCo\) launched a farming project to increase the iodine content of organic milk. This resulted in an increase in iodine concentration of organic milk to a value close to that of conventional milk **\[5.3\]**. **Beneficiaries**: Producers and consumers of organic milk. 

###  Impact on pregnancy supplements 

 Informed by our publication that showed that mild\-to\-moderate deficiency in pregnancy affected child cognition **\[3.3\]**, \{Text removed for publication\} **\[5.4\]** and Wassen International changed the formulation of its Efalex “Mother and Baby” supplement **\[5.5\]** to incorporate 150 µg iodine. 

 **Beneficiaries**: Supplement manufacturers; women of childbearing age. 

###  Impact on product formulation of iodised salt 

 Cerebos, until Nov 2019 the only UK brand of iodised salt, decided to increase the iodine concentration of its salt to 20 mg iodine/kg \(previously low at 11.5 mg/kg\) after consulting with us **\[5.6\]**. Also, based on evidence from our research that deficiency was a problem in the UK, British Salt has recently formulated a version of iodised salt for the UK market **\[5.7\]**. Its product, which contains 30 mg/kg, went on sale in October 2019; a 1g portion provides 20% of the adult RNI. 

 **Beneficiaries**: The public; vegans. 

###  Policy change for monitoring of UK iodine status in the general population 

 Our research publications **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]** contributed significantly to the evidence base for the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition \(SACN\) report on iodine **\[5.8\]** which recommended that iodine should be monitored in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey \(NDNS\). As a result, the UK has been monitoring population iodine status, providing national data on adults and children to identify iodine deficiency and inform any future need for intervention. NDNS data are also used by the Global Iodine Scorecard to classify the status of the UK population \( [https://www.ign.org/scorecard.htm](https://www.ign.org/scorecard.htm)\); this scorecard is used by WHO, UNICEF and the Iodine Global Network to track global progress on iodine status. 

 **Beneficiaries:** The public; policy makers 

###  Increased awareness of iodine deficiency among the public and health professionals 

 To better inform health professionals and the public about the importance of dietary iodine, we have increased the information available through media, print resources and online materials. Results of our studies have raised awareness of the issue of iodine deficiency, particularly in pregnancy, through our personal or research contributions to various information resources **\[5.9\]** and through extensive media interviews and coverage **\[5.10\]**. This has enabled healthcare professionals \(e.g., dietitians\) to have a greater knowledge of iodine **\[5.9\]**. 

 **Beneficiaries:* The public, particularly women of childbearing age; pregnant women; health professionals.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted by Swansea University has established the global historical significance of the South Wales copper industry and has helped to preserve and develop what is left of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks, one of the last remaining substantial built heritage assets in the lower Swansea Valley. The research has had an effect on the Swansea council development plan and the targeted regional investment programme for the lower Swansea valley. It has changed the awareness and understanding of the copper industry heritage in the communities and schools of the lower Swansea Valley, as well as bringing visitor and broadcaster interest.  It has had an effect on the GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package Copr Bay, SME location on the Hafod Morfa site and copper branding of firms in the area. Overall, the research has helped Swansea to develop a holistic historically aware approach to economic regeneration and place\-making to benefit the capacity of the community and economy in the lower Swansea Valley. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the REF2014 Copperopolis case study was all about establishing the global significance of Swansea as a centre for copper smelting. Since then, Swansea historians have uncovered much more detail about the products made from Swansea copper and the markets supplied by them worldwide. This is part of a new ‘turn’ in writing about the history of Welsh industry which goes beyond understanding places and processes of production, to examining the supply of goods and the demands of customers buying Welsh products \(R1\). By using a range of business and commercial records, Miskell and Bowen have discovered more about the importance of copper in the production of key goods used in textile manufacture, maritime, transport and food and drink industries, and about product diversification over time. This new innovative research has moved the narrative away from conventional themes of mineral supply, processing and investment, towards global markets and patterns of consumption. In doing so, it has established the centrality of Swansea copper to global processes of industrialisation and modernisation. In particular, the research has shown that: 

 In the early eighteenth century, the success of Swansea firms in establishing themselves at the centre of the new British copper industry, was their ability to meet East India Company orders to supply Asian markets with a range of products for domestic and decorative use. \(R3\) 

 The production of small, portable barter items like manillas and guinea rods for West African slave traders via Bristol merchants was also part of the output of the early Swansea firms, but occupied a smaller and diminishing part of their product base. \(R4\) 

 By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the willingness of Swansea firms like Vivian & Sons to invest in new rolling mills and steam engine technology meant that they could respond to growing demand for copper sheathing for naval and merchant sailing vessels, supplying shipbuilders and repairers with customized sheathing of different sizes and weights. \(R2\) 

 By the 1820s Swansea copper was also embedded in the growth of the mechanised textile trade with the firm of Williams & Grenfell dominating the supply of copper cylinders for printing on fabric, to Lancashire cotton manufacturers. \(R.2\) 

 The supply of copper vessels including boiling pans, stills and brewing vats to the food and drink industries provided another important source of demand for copper and saw Swansea firms supplying customers as diverse as London copper smiths who made boiling pans destined for the sugar plantations of the Caribbean, to Irish brewers and whisky distillers. \(R2\) 

 By the early twentieth century, a loss of competitiveness as a location for copper smelting saw the surviving Swansea firms focus more on manufacturing, particularly of copper components for locomotives destined for domestic and overseas railway customers. \(R2\) 

 Throughout their history, Swansea copper firms were well\-informed of — and responsive to — the fluctuating demands of global markets and tailored their products accordingly in order to retain their overseas customers and remain competitive. 

 These key research insights have helped the story of Swansea copper to reach a new range of audiences in the public, private and third sector and have provided a stimulus to the next phase of grant capture and development planning for the Hafod Morfa Copperworks site. This is one of the last remaining built heritage legacies of the copper industry in the lower Swansea Valley, an area once popularly known as Copperopolis.  Bowen and Langlands have worked to preserve the site in conjunction with Swansea Council.  Since 2014 their grant capture has sought to focus on continued site restoration as well as initiating the regeneration potential of this built heritage to the redevelopment of the lower Swansea Valley. \(G1, G2, G3, G4, G5\)

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The uncovering of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s industrial copperworking heritage continues to inform publicly funded programmes resulting in a profound change in attitude across public, private and third sector institutions. Not only has the research been matched to community and enterprise need in the drawing down of over GBP3,600,000 of grant funding **\[G1 – G5\]**, it has impacted upon planning and regeneration policies **\[C1\]**, attracted SME investment **\[C7\]**, and enriched the cultural life **\[C4, 5, 6, 8, 9\]** of wards in the lowest two quintiles of the Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation. 

 <ins> **Influence on public planning and regeneration policy**</ins> 

 The period between 2008 and 2020, has witnessed a sea change in the approach to economic regeneration in the city **\[C1\]**. In the **Swansea Bay City Region Economic Strategy 2013\-2030 \(2013\)**, not a single reference to heritage nor the historic environment was made. The City and Council of Swansea’s own **Unitary Development Plan \(2008\)** made only a passing reference to the role industrial heritage can play in the tourist economy. Even in the **Swansea Local Development Plan Topic Paper: Culture and Heritage \(2013\)**, ‘heritage\-led’ regeneration consisted of limited opportunities within the tourism and built heritage construction sectors. However, the statutory heritage body of Welsh Government, Cadw, sought the help of the university to provide the underpinning historical research for its 2016 Urban Characterisation report on the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C3\]**. This study identified and set out the significance, distinctiveness and unique historic character of the local region. Concurrently, research undertaken by Swansea University historians heavily influenced the production of the ‘master plan’ produced by heritage consultants Purcell for a ‘copperworks’ enterprise and mixed\-use park **\[C1\]**. 

 The City and Council of Swansea’s **Local Development Plan 2010\-2025 \(Deposit Plan, July 2016\)** drew directly on both of these documents in setting out its ambitions for the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks site and its links to the ‘River Tawe Corridor’, listing a ‘heritage\-led project’ to include ‘restoration of historic buildings’ and a ‘heritage visitor centre’ **\[C1\]**. The renewed historic significance of the surviving monuments created the case for World Heritage Site status, and this impacted greatly on policy and decision makers in the region **\[C1\]**. Listed buildings that had been subjected to neglect for decades, despite many attempts to rescue them, now ‘represent a significant regeneration opportunity’ with proposals for the heritage led regeneration of the site being driven by ‘The Hafod/Morfa Copperworks Project’, a partnership project between the Council and Swansea University **\[C2, C10\]**. This regeneration is now being realised publicly by the **Targeted Regeneration Investment Programme \(TRIP\) 2018**, through which the Hafod\-Morfa Copperworks is set to receive over GBP2,000,000 of investment from a total of GBP27,000,000 for the south\-west region **\[C1\]**. Head of Economic Development and External Funding at Swansea Council says: ‘ *This is a major turnaround from 10 years ago when the site was covered in vegetation, forgotten and decaying. It can now look forward to a bright, collaborative future, part of a regional investment campaign, understood by key national and regional investment partners, and a place to live, work and play, celebrating the extensive heritage both of the works itself, and the wider legacy in the Lower Swansea Valley*’ **\[C2\]**. From 2015 through to the present day, Swansea University research staff have sat on the project boards for regeneration projects in the area and attended key decision\-making meetings on a range of issues relevant to redevelopment, restoration and public engagement in the Lower Swansea Valley **\[C10\]**. This has served as a key corollary through which the historic significance and heritage potential of the surviving assets has been communicated, in turn supporting the case for TRIP funding. These funds, traditionally reserved for investment in commercial and economic zones \(such as town centres/high streets\), have been targeted at ‘shell and core’ restorations of the physical heritage assets, in a plan to attract high\-end commercial ‘anchor tenants’ to further stimulate economic growth in the region. 

 In a climate where even in Cadw’s own report on **Valuing the Welsh Historic Environment \(2010\)**, primacy was given to the direct ‘economic value’ of the historic environment, the Lower Swansea Valley is experiencing a shift in approach to one that identifies the route to true sustainable economic growth lying first and foremost in the recognition of the historic significance and sense of place. The significance of Miskell and Bowen’s research has been identified by Cadw and the National Lottery Heritage Fund **\[C3\]**. The historical research that has established the importance to Britain of Swansea’s copperworking industries underpins place\-making policies now being advocated at regional and national governmental levels **\[C6\]**. 

 <ins> **The Cultural Impacts of Historic Significance**</ins> 

 Swansea historians led a sustained collaborative engagement campaign ranging from national events with 6,000 visitors \(The Man Engine Cymru, April 2018\), to National Lottery Heritage Fund\-supported renovation work. This has resulted in far greater public appreciation of the historic and global significance of Swansea’s copperworking industries **\[C4, C9\]**. Not only have these enriched the social and cultural life of a deprived area, but they have served to sharpen a sense of distinctive identity shaped by copper heritage, which has drawn the attention of a number of national broadcasters **\[C5\].** This is also evident from the large number of volunteers and visitors to the site over the past 5 years **\[C4\]**, which includes a group of committed people who have formed the Friends of the Hafod Morfa Copperworks group who take care of the site and offer guided tours **\[C9\]**. One of the group’s founders and current Chair, engineer Tom Henderson outlines the long\-term value of Swansea University’s instigation of the regeneration process: ‘ *the awareness of Swansea's past industrial process that Huw Bowen helped kickstart, \[…\] the archaeology, \[…\] archives searches and the oral histories \[…\] that the friends group have carried out have all helped clear the path to tangible progress in regenerating the former copperworks sites in the lower Swansea valley*’ **\[C4\]**. The success of this research\-informed University and volunteer partnership is set out by the Economic Development Officer, Swansea Council stating: ‘ *The collaboration between the council, university, friends and volunteers has shown that the model works well and can achieve excellent results and prove good value for money. We believe that this model can be used in the future for further phases of restoration*’ **\[C2\]**. 

 Research into the investment of Swansea copper firms in the latest plant and machinery has given impetus to the Musgrave Engine restoration project **\[G3\]**. The Musgrave Engine – the last surviving remnant of the advanced steam\-powered rolling technology in use on the Hafod Morfa site – is now being refurbished and rehoused as a visitor attraction. Involving primary school children in this process has done much to enrich local awareness of this vital cultural asset. As one teacher from Hafod primary says, **‘** *We have also learned a lot from our involvement in the Musgrave restoration project. Outreach workshops, creative sessions and trips are very beneficial to us in our learning*.’ **\[C8\]** 

 <ins> **An Attraction for Regional and SME Investment**</ins> 

 Swansea University’s research on the historical significance of the copper working industries to the Lower Swansea Valley has led ultimately to the iconic metal itself playing a major role in the construction, branding and public communication of a GBP1,000,000,000 regeneration package for a new district in Swansea: **Copr Bay.** The landmark construction of the new district will be a copper bridge, and artist and designer Marc Rees notes that it, *‘represents the transition from the past to the future. It symbolizes Swansea’s aspiration to evolve, grow, flourish and become even more exciting but still very much rooted in a sense of place’* **\[C7\]**. The process of public consultation for this project is set to be informed by technologies developed through EPSRC funds allocated by CherishDE to the Hafod Morfa Copperworks as a ‘Resource Constrained Community’ **\[G2\] \[C7\].** 

 The historic significance of the copperworks, and the role the metal played in the emergence of a global distilling industry **\[R2\]**, is a key attraction for **Penderyn**’s desire to build a new distillery and visitor centre on the site **\[C7\]**. Research carried out at Swansea University has established the historic importance of whisky distilling firms as customers of Swansea copper firms, and is set to inform the content, interpretation and display within that visitor centre, creating a new narrative around how the copper goods produced in Swansea went on to have a global impact **\[R2\]**. Drawing on GBP3,500,000 of NLHF investment and an additional GBP4,000,000 of private sector investment, the future of the Power House, one of the site’s most important heritage assets, has been secured for at least another 100 years **\[C6\].** Within, copper equipment and technology will be utilized as part of an industrial process, 15 FTE jobs will be created and a 50,000 visitors will be attracted per annum. 

 An increased affinity for the copper ‘brand’ was exemplified by Swansea City FC’s adoption a copper heritage theme \(2015\) within the hospitality part of their Liberty Stadium \(located on part of the Hafod\-Morfa site\), a process informed by our researchers. A new white and copper playing kit for season 2015\-16 was also launched accompanied by a promotional video drawing directly on research by Swansea historians. Indeed the region is now furnished with a range of SMEs trading on the copper brand, including Copper Bar, Copperfish, Copper Bay Digital, Coppergate and the Copper Jack \- an illustration of how the historic and global significance of copper to the region, a narrative largely promoted by research at Swansea University, has created a brand identity that local businesses take pride in trading on **\[C7\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Incorrectly claimed payment exemptions for dental and ophthalmic treatments cost NHS Scotland approximately GBP10 million annually. From 2016 onwards, UofG researchers developed an award\-winning collaboration with NHS Scotland to increase financial recoveries. Based upon theoretical and empirical research, they co\-designed ‘frames’ that were embedded in letters requesting voluntary payments for incorrectly claimed exemptions, replacing the threat of a penalty charge. This initiative: \(i\) supported increased cash recoveries of over GBP580,000 during the initial intervention phase; \(ii\) resulted in changes to NHS Scotland’s practice and culture \(e.g. more robust planning and evaluation of interventions; the long\-term adoption of experimental methods inspired by behavioural economics\). In turn, this activity has underpinned: \(iii\) successful spinout projects and sustained financial recoveries.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **2.1. Context** 

 Traditional economic theory assumes that decision makers are rational: they are logical, objective and have sufficient means to reach identified ends. Behavioural economics does not make this assumption. It instead assumes that decision makers attempt to make rational decisions, but do not always do so due to factors such as limited information, limited means or cognitive bias. These decisions are not irrational, but ‘boundedly rational’. The framing effect is an example of cognitive bias whereby people decide on an option based upon the way in which information is presented, and whether the options presented are perceived in a positive or negative light. That frames can impact on decision\-making is a key insight of direct relevance from the seminal behavioural economics research carried out by Kahneman and Tversky. 

 **2.2. Theoretical research** 

 In 2016, Ghosal \(with Dalton, Tilburg University, and Mani, University of Oxford\) **\[3.1\]** conducted a highly\-influential study in terms of setting out the conditions of successful policy interventions. It explored a range of policy interventions that can raise the welfare levels of boundedly rational decision makers to the same levels as rational decision makers. The research developed a theoretical framework to show that exposure to positive stimuli could reduce behavioural bias by helping decision makers to recognise the link between their current efforts and future aspirations. 

 In 2018, Ghosal \(with Dalton\) focused on frames that influence, and adapt to, behaviour over time \(so become self\-fulfilling\) **\[3.2\]**. An example of a self\-fulfilling frame could be where the presumption of wrongdoing, and immediate threat of a penalty charge or fine, leads to poor returns in terms of fines being paid—the negative framing of the information influences behaviour, thus shaping the outcome. The research set out the conditions under which frames \(and more broadly, default choice architecture\) are self\-fulfilling, and worked out the welfare implications of such frames. 

 **2.3. Empirical research** 

 In 2019, Ghosal *et al* analysed and reported evidence from a randomised control trial that altered frames in order to mitigate mistakes in decision\-making within a vulnerable, stigmatised population **\[3.3\]**. A key premise was that these individuals were able to forecast the short\-run consequences of their actions \(e.g. more money in the short\-term through not paying a fine\) but not the medium or long\-term consequences \(e.g. having to pay a statutory penalty charge eventually\). The findings demonstrated that designing frames within this context could impact on choices and behaviour in the medium term, as those who participated in the program exhibited improved self\-efficacy, a greater sense of agency and willingness to invest in the future. 

 **2.4. Key findings** 

 The key findings from this body of research are that by recognising conditions where self\-fulfilling frames underpin negative results **\[3.2\]**; and establishing conditions that raise the aspirations of decision makers \(by linking current efforts to future aspirations\) **\[3.1\]**; frames can be used to influence behaviour in the absence of using an explicit monetary disincentive, such as a penalty charge or fine **\[3.3\]**. These findings have underpinned a pioneering collaboration between UofG researchers and NHS Scotland Counter Fraud Services. 

 Ghosal’s unique contribution is the combination of theoretical and empirical findings, which established the conditions for successful interventions and provided the justification for using frames in such initiatives. Koutmeridis’ research **\[3.4\]** \(with Draca, University of Warwick, and Machin, London School of Economics\) examined the determinants of unlawful and illegal behaviour. Koutmeridis’ experience in conducting empirical research within this context informed the design of the frames and the data collection methods deployed in this successful collaboration.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Baseline context** 

 Exemptions from payment for dental and ophthalmic treatments cost NHS Scotland approximately GBP75 million per annum. Approximately 1.4 million exemption claims are made each year from approximately 6 million total patient contacts. NHS Counter Fraud Services have historically checked 50,000 claims per annum; the estimated fraud/error rate is around 14% with annual losses to NHS Scotland of approximately GBP10 million. 

 **4.2. Pathways to impact** 

 In order to tackle this issue, in June 2015 and February 2016 initial knowledge exchange workshops were held between the UofG, NHS Scotland, the Glasgow Centre for Population Health, Scottish Government and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. These workshops were followed by face\-to\-face meetings between Ghosal and a Senior Counter Fraud Specialist from NHS Scotland. Ghosal was subsequently invited to present his research at the NHS Scotland Counter Fraud Network Meeting in November 2016 \(confirmed by invitation **\[5A\]**\). At this presentation, Ghosal set out how his research on self\-fulfilling frames could be used to influence behaviour in lieu of threatening a penalty charge or fine \(confirmed by slides **\[5B\]**\). This led Senior NHS managers to invite Ghosal to collaborate in the co\-design of a new intervention for incorrectly claimed exemptions for payment of charges for dental and ophthalmic treatments. 

 **4.3. Co\-designing an intervention** 

 NHS Scotland’s ‘business as usual’ process for incorrectly claimed exemptions previously involved a letter initiating a penalty charge after 30 days of non\-payment. In contrast, the intervention involved eligibility checks being undertaken on all claims received within a period of 4\-8 weeks, followed by a written request for voluntary payment of the charges without the threat of a penalty charge. The written request took one of three different formats, corresponding to three co\-designed frames \(which were tested on 6,000 patients\). The sample was split into equal cohorts with letters adopting one of three frames: \(i\) a ‘social welfare’ frame, which emphasised that wrongly claimed exemptions can divert money from NHS patients; \(ii\) a ‘neutral’ frame; or \(iii\) a ‘consequences’ frame, which stated that claimants’ future treatment activities may be monitored. In each letter, patients were asked to pay for their treatment, and in future to ensure that they were entitled to claim exemptions before doing so. 

 Ghosal, Koutmeridis and the Senior Counter Fraud Specialist from NHS Scotland then drafted an NHS document seeking approval for the initiative. The document **\[5C\]**, which directly cites the underpinning research **\[3.1**, **3.4\]**, demonstrated how NHS Scotland could use the empirical data collected to take the initiative forward in the long term. The approval and subsequent implementation of this initiative by NHS Scotland was the first evidence of actual change, marking the first time that NHS Scotland Counter Fraud Services had incorporated insights from behavioural economics in their activities. This was supported by NHS Scotland funding of GBP60,000.00 to back the collaboration in 2017 \(confirmed by email **\[5D\]**\) **.** 

 **4.4. Increased financial recoveries** 

 The Senior Counter Fraud Specialist, NHS Scotland, confirms that, *‘the support that Professor Sayantan Ghosal provides to NHS Scotland has a real, positive financial impact.’* \(statement **\[5E\]**\). From September 2017 onwards, batches of letters utilising the new frames were sent out at weekly intervals. In the first seven weeks, 7,800 letters were issued and GBP109,330.00 was collected as a result \(confirmed by data **\[5F\]**\). This was achieved without the threat of a penalty charge, using letters incorporating the three co\-designed frames. The Senior Counter Fraud Specialist, NHS Scotland, further underlined the economic impact of the initiative: *“In general terms we are very happy to be receiving over £100,000 per month, which is almost five times our previous monthly income.”  In a subsequent email, the Senior Counter Fraud Specialist, NHS Scotland, confirmed that cash recoveries from patients found to have incorrectly claimed exemption were GBP935,841.71 for 2017/18 \(including the six\-month intervention\). The comparative figure was GBP355,301.95 for 2016/17 \(pre intervention\), which represents an increase of GBP580,539.76 \(confirmed by collated emails **\[5G\]**\) 

 **4.5. Changes to NHS Scotland’s practice and culture** 

 In March 2018, NHS Scotland’s business as usual letter was modified to incorporate the ‘social welfare’ frame as standard. Although all of the co\-designed frames worked successfully, the ‘social welfare’ frame was selected over the ‘consequences’ frame as it was perceived more positively: 

 *‘Most people pay for their dental treatment unless they qualify for exemption. Only a minority in your area wrongly claim exemption, diverting money away from patients like you who rely on NHS healthcare. Make sure you are not one of them.’* **\[5H\]** 

 The incorporation of the ‘social welfare’ frame into the business as usual letter entails that improved cash recoveries will continue in the long term. As a direct result, this pioneering collaboration was awarded an NHS Scotland Excellence in Innovation and Efficiency Award in 2019. NHS Scotland Counter Fraud Services was also named Team of the Year at the UK Government Counter Fraud Awards that same year \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5I\]**\). 

 The Senior Counter Fraud Specialist, NHS Scotland, also confirms changes to institutional culture based upon the collaboration with UofG researchers: *‘We have been coached by Sayantan \[Ghosal\] to develop a research culture where the impact of our fraud prevention interventions can be measured, repeated and the results withstand scrutiny. The importance of controlling variables is now commonly understood within my team’.* He added: *‘following on from this campaign we worked with our IT supplier to create an editable field in our ‘business as usual’ letter. We hope to start soon with experiments to test the effectiveness of different message frames to engage more people with our normal statutory recovery process without resorting to fines, penalties and higher cost of administration.’* \(statement **\[5E\]**\). 

 The adoption of these experimental methods by NHS Scotland Counter Fraud Services has underpinned subsequent initiatives and procedural changes. For instance, based upon consultation with Ghosal and Koutmeridis, an automated telephone payment line was introduced in order to remove the ‘process friction’ that occurs in debt\-recovery telephone conversations. For these reasons, ongoing financial recoveries cannot solely be attributed to the co\-designed intervention. What can be confirmed is that, from July 2019 to March 2020, 17,245 letters incorporating the ‘social welfare’ frame were sent out \(prior to activities being suspended by COVID\-19\). In terms of financial recoveries, the available data covers the period from September 2019 to December 2019, in which the total recoveries were approximately GBP330,000.00 \(which would equate to approximately GBP990,000.00 per annum\). These figures suggest that increased financial recoveries are sustained at a similar level to the original intervention period \(confirmed by collated evidence **\[5J\]**\). 

 **4.6. Spinout interventions** 

 Based upon the principles of this initiative, Ghosal and Koutmeridis have embarked on new collaborations with NHS Scotland Counter Fraud Services. Firstly, Operation Lugano designed a frame to be embedded in a letter to be sent to ophthalmologists to check patient eligibility when exemption claims are first made. From December 2019 to February 2020, a three\-month pilot intervention recorded 516 fewer claims \(in comparison with the same time period the previous year\) with a value of GBP30,671.00 \(confirmed by data **\[5K\]**\). The Senior Counter Fraud Specialist, NHS Scotland, confirms that, *‘early indications suggest that savings have been realised and when annualised create a cost savings ratio of more than 1:1000 for the £1000 cost of postage.’* \(confirmed by statement **\[5E\]**\). 

 The second initiative, Operation Como \(originally due to begin in April 2020 but delayed by COVID\-19\) was set to adopt the same principles by sending 1,000 letters to dental practices, where spending is significantly higher than ophthalmic practices. Predictions based upon previous interventions suggested that this could prevent losses of up to GBP100,000 per annum \(confirmed by statement **\[5E\]**\). The Senior Counter Fraud Specialist, NHS Scotland, adds that, *‘the next phase of our activities in tackling this area of loss is to investigate whether it is possible to increase the options to include something like a small loan from a credit union. This would be a really worthwhile area to explore and the knowledge that Sayantan \[Ghosal\] brings to this subject will be crucial in finding the best solution.’* 

 UofG research has, therefore, not only contributed to our understanding of an aspect of behavioural economics through a substantial empirical application, but has impacted on policy and practice by devising an intervention based upon its theories. This has realised significant financial recoveries for NHS Scotland, which can now be redistributed to support patient care.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Michael Gove famously claimed that the country has had enough of experts. Dr Goodall’s work shows this is wrong. Organisations led and managed by core business experts outperform those that are not. Her ‘expert leader’ research has received global media exposure and she has given dozens of keynotes, such as Ontario Hospital Association, British Medical Association and Organization of Danish Medical Societies. It has generated public discussion, influenced leadership development and is changing attitudes about the importance of expertise in healthcare, schools, universities, politics and engineering where policies are changing as a result in US, Australia, India, UK and Denmark. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Over the last thirty years two organisational shifts have occurred: first, although good management is recognised as important to performance, the pendulum has swung too far towards managerialism. Second, there has been a rise in the appointment of general managers, over technical experts, into key leadership positions. The case for ‘expert leadership’ suggests this move away from technical expertise is a mistake. Evidence supporting this premise comes from many different sectors and at different tiers of leadership, from CEO\-to line managers and department heads. **\[3.1\-3.5\]**           Dr Goodall was the first to show that the ranked position of a US hospital was higher when it was led by a medical doctor instead of a non\-medically trained manager. The analysis found that hospital quality scores were approximately 25% higher in physician\-run systems compared with those led by general managers **\[3.3\].** The first evidence demonstrating a relationship between core business experts and organisational performance came from higher education.  In US cross\-sectional and UK longitudinal data, research\-intensive universities were shown to improve in their performance \(in the RAE\) when led by Presidents who were themselves highly competent scholars **\[3.1\]**. The finding was replicated among Deans of business schools and academic Department Chairs **.** 

 Goodall et al. also studied leadership in professional sports: in longitudinal data from 15,000 basketball games, those leaders who had been top players were associated with better team performance once becoming a coach, demonstrated by winning percentage and playoffs success **\[3.4\]**. Similarly, in Formula 1, Goodall et al. examined the performance of every team over six decades and showed that team principals with extensive racing experience were associated with better team performance as measured by obtaining podium positions **\[3.5\].**            The next step was to understand *why* and *how* core business experts seem to influence performance.  Recent work uncovered a significant relationship between the prevalence of expert leaders and the job satisfaction and ‘quit’ intensions of followers. \(Job satisfaction is known to effect individual and organisational performance.\) Within HE, faculty were more satisfied with their job and less likely to leave their university **\[3.2\]** when they reported that their Department Chair was a distinguished researcher. This finding has been discovered across a wide range of industries. In a random sample of 35,000 UK and US employees matched to their firms, the single strongest predictor of job satisfaction was the competence of the immediate supervisor.  This was measured in three ways: if the supervisor could do the employees’ job; if s/he worked their way up through the organisation or started it, and if employees perceived their supervisor to be competent **\[3.6\].** In new research this finding has been replicated in four studies in four countries of medical doctors reporting on their line manager \(also a doctor\), including in one analysis using objective data to validate supervisors’ clinical expertise. 

 Dr Goodall’s research suggests that expert leaders have this influence on employees through their management practices and the work environment they create **\[3.2\]**. An offered explanation is that leaders who are technical experts share with their subordinates’ the same values and belief systems, skills, preferences and strategies which informs their behaviour.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Goodall’s focus is on leadership and organisational performance through her research, engagement and advocacy of the Theory of Expert Leadership. Her message – about the importance of experts in leadership and management – has achieved significant impact, particularly in the healthcare sector and across countries \(US, Australia, Denmark, UK\). South Australia Mental Health Services used her work in 2014. The sector had worsening KPIs with acute psychiatric patients being denied access to hospital. The crisis climaxed with the suicide of a 15\-year\-old girl. Based on the Coroner’s report, psychiatrists used Dr Goodall’s research to change the debate and subsequent review of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services **\[5.1\].**  The government recognised that renewed medical leadership was required to transform the sector.  As a result, psychiatrists were returned to leadership positions in SA Mental Health **\[5.2\]**, replacing non\-clinical managers. The team responsible applied Dr Goodall’s Theory of Expert Leadership to the £200 million mental health sector. As a result, waiting times for acute mental health patients were halved **\[5.2\]** and overcrowding in Emergency Departments reduced **\[5.3\]**. 

 The body representing all doctors in Denmark, the Organisation of Danish Medical Societies \(LSV\), approached Dr Goodall when the government threatened changes to doctors’ contracts because it believed they were unwilling to go into leadership. She was asked to give a keynote at LSV’s Centenary conference, targeting medics, policy makers and politicians, to use her research to “ *motivate doctors into becoming leaders*”. Prior to the event she and LSV surveyed the country’s doctors: she found that doctors reported higher job satisfaction and lower quit intention when their line manager was perceived to be a strong clinician \(the expert leader result\). Second, the survey revealed that among respondents \(\#4,500\), 70% said they were willing to lead, and importantly, they outlined their incentives and disincentives associated with a move into management **\[5.4\]**. Dr Goodall’s contribution was hailed as influential and has been mentioned repeatedly in Scandinavian political and medical debates **\[5.5\]**. As a result, the LSV’s Board of Directors formulated proposals such as *“the active recruitment and training of medical professionals to develop leadership talent for the Danish health care system*” **\[5.4\]**. Their policy changes came into effect in April 2019, recognising Dr Goodall’s contribution **\[5.5\].** 

 In North America, CEO of The American Association for Physician Leadership, representing 10,000 doctors in 40 countries, said *“Dr Goodall’s work is seminal and foundational as the industry attempts to better absorb and leverage the advantages of physician leadership. Health care is better as a result of the insights Dr. Goodall and her team provide*” **\[5.6\]**. This is mirrored in Canada where she has given several keynotes. The Executive Medical Director of Canadian Society of Physician Leaders said Dr Goodall has influenced the Canadian health system in two areas: through learning and education and in the application of her research leading to organisational change **\[5.7\].** The Chairman of the Education Institute and senior pulmonary surgeon at the highly ranked Cleveland Clinic \- with 220 outpatient locations, 18 hospitals, and 70,000 caregivers worldwide \- stated “\[Dr Goodall’s\] work has been highly impactful in influencing thinking and enhancing the growing appetite to train physicians in leadership competencies.” **\[5.8\].** 

 Her work is also changing policies in the UK. Dr Steve Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England, on our TV screens throughout the pandemic, and the CEO & Medical Director of Faculty of Medical Leadership & Management, have acknowledged that her research has changed their thinking about medical leadership **\[5.19\]**. Dr Goodall was the only management scholar invited to a roundtable established by Dr Powis \(for senior NHS leaders\). As a result, the issue of expert leadership was raised at ministerial level with further action forthcoming in the NHS People Plan \(ex. Clinical leadership by March 2021 p.29\) \[ **5.19\].** Dr Powis said: “\[TEL\] *greatly influenced my thinking on medical leadership and my ongoing work to develop and strengthen this with partners such as the FMLM and NHS Leadership Academy*” **\[5.9\]**. The CEO of University College London Hospital concurs: “ *As a result of Dr Goodall’s research the thinking around appointing professional leaders in hospitals has dramatically changed and many centres have implemented these ideas... an example, the … Shelford group of hospitals \(10 leading UK academic medical institutions\) have now appointed a \(medical\) consultant as their Chief Executive*."" **\[5.10\].** The strength of the Dr Goodall’s work is such that other experts have relied on it when providing evidence in parliament **\[5.11\].** 

 The research has also influenced third party policy work and it continues to spread to new sectors. For example: In education, the Executive Director of the government created Ambition Institute said: “ *We provide training and development for school leaders, working with around 7,000 educators each year in some of England’s most challenging schools. Over the last year \(2019\), we have revised our organisation’s theory of change and subsequently redesigned our development programmes based around a model of expertise.  Amanda Goodall’s work and proposition of ‘Expert Leadership’ has been a significant influence throughout this process*.” **\[5.12\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers in C\-DaRE have worked with IT developers, custodians of cultural content, dance artists, and marginalised dance communities to create digital applications for dance practices as aspects of intangible cultural heritage \(ICH\). The research, driven by enabling impact, has been into datafication and transmission of ICH, and the relationship between dance content and machine learning. The research has led to three areas of impact: \(1\) changes in methods used by IT developers working with dance content; \(2\) new approaches to curation of dance content and safeguarding practices that feed into wider sector practices; \(3\) increased visibility for marginalised dance communities. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research of Professor Sarah Whatley, Dr Rosamaria Cisneros and Dr Karen Wood at Coventry University focuses upon how dance, as an embodied practice, calls on new methods for digital tool development in order to archive, annotate, share, reuse and safeguard dance content online. 

 Through Europeana Space, an EU funded project \(2014\-2017, G1;  [https://www.europeana\-space.eu/](https://www.europeana-space.eu/)\), Whatley and Cisneros investigated ways in which ICH might generate commercial revenue. As part of the project, Whatley and Cisneros worked with IT experts and entrepreneurs to develop the apps, Dancespaces and Dancepro. Dancespaces targeted the needs of dance enthusiasts and pre\-dance professionals who want to share and explore content about a particular aspect of dance. **DancePro** provided a tool for researchers and dance experts \(e.g. dance artists, choreographers\) to access dance content and create metadata \(R2, R4\). 

 Through an EU funded project, WhoLoDancE \(2015\-2018, G2,  [http://www.wholodance.eu/](http://www.wholodance.eu/)\) Whatley, Wood and Cisneros worked closely with technologists to develop apps that capture dance as ICH \(in particular, Flamenco and Greek folk dance\) and influence ways in which dance is taught, learnt and made. Changes in consumption and use became apparent in audiences and educators through an extended evaluation process, involving 200\+ respondents across the dance sector, Europe\-wide. Tool development \(including for annotation, similarity search, blending engine, hololens experience\) revealed how the plasticity of dance needs to be built into software practices \(R3, R4\). 

 The role of Flamenco as a vehicle for intercultural communication was the focus of the work by Cisneros in her contribution to the EU\-funded RICHES project:  [https://www.riches\-project.eu/index.html](https://www.riches-project.eu/index.html) \(R1\). Cisneros organised the Coventry FlamenKo Festival \(3\-7 November 2014, G4,  [https://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/the\-roma\-in\-coventry\-digital\-practices\-and\-identity\-expression/](https://www.digitalmeetsculture.net/article/the-roma-in-coventry-digital-practices-and-identity-expression/)\), designed to educate the public about Flamenco, and to showcase Gypsy/Roma cultural art forms. The Festival offered insights into how engagement with Romani cultural heritage can be sustained; how digital technologies can be used effectively to document and promote these initiatives for larger audiences; and how art can be used as an entry point and vehicle for intercultural communication. 515 people attended the festival including students, academics, artists, citizens and politicians \(R5\). The research demonstrated that the festival changed audience perceptions of marginalised and minority communities, increased visibility of this community’s dance practices, and provided venues with new ways to access history \(R5\). 

 The EU funded project CultureMoves led by Cisneros and Whatley \(2018\-2020, G3\) explored the impact that dance and dance content accessible through Europeana, and available via digital technologies, could have on tourism and touristic experiences. They hosted a series of 12 lab\-days over 18 months involving 275 stakeholders including dancers, choreographers, artists, academics, CH institutions and architecture MA students from countries including UK, Italy and Portugal. Research showed that dance provides access to ‘hidden’ aspects of a site, monument, or landscape, and that digital tools can stimulate new stories for making the bridge between dance and tourism \(R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2014, researchers in C\-DaRE have worked with IT developers, custodians of cultural content, dance artists, and marginalised and minority dance communities on research projects driven by enabling impact. They have created a range of digital applications for dance practices as aspects of ICH **\(S7\).** 

 **1.    IT developers have changed ways of developing tools and interfaces and methods for exploiting and consuming digital dance content while recognising dancers’ different practices, needs and expectations.** The Innovation Manager of IN2 **\(S1\)** on the ESpace and CultureMoves projects **\(R6, G1, G3\)**, said that his company now “ *better understand\(s\) the unique qualities of dance as an artistic medium, and of the specialist needs of the dance community who would be the eventual end users of the ICT system.”* Collaboration enabled *“a truly user\-driven development process, a key aspect for delivering user\-friendly software tools”.* In interface development, the technologies have *“transferred to the commercial products that we bring to the market. Our commercial solutions, like the MyMeedia platform for \(...\) multimedia content, are a direct result of the learning and development that occurred in the creation of the applications for these projects in terms of technology innovation and gained know\-how in how to design better systems...”* The Founder and CEO of PeachNote **\(S5\)** on WhoLoDance **\(R3, R4, G2\)**, describes how the collaboration with the C\-DaRE team influenced their product development, changing methods for how they *“measure and analyse human motion and expression”.* 

 **2.Custodians of cultural content have changed safeguarding and curatorial practices, with impact on the dance sector **.** An ICT expert and cultural heritage SME owner **\(S2\),** a collaborator on RICHES and ESpace **\(R1, R2\),** states that C\-DaRE’s work has led to rethinking the involvement of ‘community’ and ‘user’ in developing digital technologies within cultural heritage organisations, with wider application for other cultural practices and how learning can *“transform the whole sector”*. The ICT expert noted: *“the unique accommodations that dance requires in terms of digitisation is imposing a change on how we consider best practices within the ICH sector. It has made obvious how deficient some of the technologies we rely on are and impos\(ed\) innovation in how we conduct our work.”* 

 Changed practices have helped creative influencers to shape sector trends. The co\-founder of the REMIX Summits **\(S3\)** collaborated on the ESpace project **\(R2\)**. He said that “ *Working with dance experts from the C\-DaRE team has made me consider more deeply the body in space, the organisation of the body and the specific concerns of integrating technology with dance and the moving body in other projects.”*  This collaboration also had an impact on ACMI X with the Australian Centre for the Moving Image, StartSpace with the State Library of Victoria and Foundry 658, and has *“fed into the programming of the REMIX Summits.”* Whatley and Cisneros’s research enabled the entrepreneur to expand his own work into dance which included a collaboration with Studio Wayne McGregor on QuestLab. This allowed the entrepreneur to *“apply to the creation of ideas about dance and technology, the incubation of these ideas through research and development phases, and business modelling process”.* 

 **3. Awareness has been heightened that combining technologies and dance can raise the visibility of marginalised and minority dance communities.** Cisneros’s staging of the FlamenKo Festival **\(R5\)** in RICHES **\(G4\)** and development of the RomArchive emerged from the confluence of research in dance and technology. The RomArchive has won several awards, the most prestigious being the European Heritage Awards Grand Prix organised by the European Commission and Europa Nostra **\(S6\).** The participatory project directly involved the Roma community and has had impact on Roma, Gypsy and Traveller groups by illuminating their own history.The ED of Romani Cultural & Arts Company \(RCAC\)\) **\(S4\)** said the *“research and resultant festival made clear how the arts, culture and technology can promote the contributions of marginalised groups, be used to disrupt commonly held stereotypes of the Roma people and can aid intercultural communication”*: the research *“would position and represent the Roma people”*. The project also changed perceptions of other communities by making *“clear the diversity in these communities and challeng\(ing\) stereotypes”.* The RCAC can now evidence the *“capabilities and status of the organisation when applying for future funding programmes, or in advocating for the Roma, Gypsy and Traveller communities to local and national governments”.* The work has expanded, gaining funding from the German Cultural Foundation and receiving attention from the Minister of State for Europe, Michael Roth, at the event ‘Reinventing Roma Inclusion’ at the opening of ERIAC 2019 **\(S6\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Green chemistry research and innovation policy originating at Imperial College \(IC\) has propelled technologies that are now helping to achieve a thriving ‘net zero’ economy in London. Research commencing in 2006, co\-led by Professor Richard Templer, conceptualised the design of a near net zero industrial ecosystem which provided the framework for an EU\-funded accelerator programme for new clean technology start\-ups. Since 2011, the IC\-based accelerator has supported 64 start\-ups in securing $300 million of investment – a 25\-fold return on public funding. Building on this success, the Mayor of London sought Professor Templer’s advice in 2017 to create a cleantech roadmap that has now become part of official Mayoral policy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A number of countries, including the UK, have made commitments to move to a net zero emissions economy. In 2006, **a UK\-US chemistry group co\-led by Professor Richard Templer**, published the conceptual design of a near net zero industrial economy, underpinned by sustainable biopower and biomaterials **\[1\]**. It considered micro\-technologies, for example, gene engineering approaches to increase the efficiency of the carbon fixing photosynthetic reaction of the enzyme RuBisCO, as well macro\- interventions such as designing biomaterials for recycling as part of a circular system. 

 Since then, the fundamental underpinning chemistry and many of the research themes and technologies outlined in the 2006 paper have been further explored and developed at IC, partly through the support of a Climate\-KIC Accelerator Programme \(see section 4\). 

 An **IC team led by Professors Jason Hallett \(co\-author of \[1\]\) and Tom Welton plus Dr Agnieszka Brandt\-Talbot** investigated the use of lignocellulosic biomass as a source of liquid biofuels, bio\-based materials and bio\-derived chemicals. This requires a pre\-treatment step before the sugars contained in the biomass can be processed biologically or chemically. In 2017, the group demonstrated the feasibility of using low\-cost \(ca. $1 kg<sup>−1</sup>\) ionic liquids, including triethylammonium hydrogen sulfate, for fractionation into a cellulose rich pulp, a lignin and a distillate. They found that up to 85% of the lignin and up to 100% of the hemicellulose were solubilized into the ionic liquid solution. The ionic liquid was successfully recovered and recycled four times \[ **2**\]. This work effectively represented the first demonstration of an efficient and repeated lignocellulose fractionation and ultimately led to the creation of the successful **startup Lixea**. 

 An **IC team led by Professor Anthony Kucernak and Dr Daniel Malko** have investigated the use of non\-precious elements, including nitrogen carbon composites, as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. For example, in 2015 they found that the polymerisation of 1,5\-diaminonaphthalene provides self\-assembled nanospheres, which form a catalytically active high surface area.  Crucially the reaction is tolerant to a wide range of substances that normally poison precious metal\-based catalysts, thus lending itself to applications in complex and challenging mixtures, including in fuel cells using low quality fuels; oxygen sensing in different biological media; and in wastewater treatment \[ **3**\]. Indeed, this work led to the creation of **startup SweetGen**, offering solutions for the treatment of industrial wastewater streams \(with concurrent generation of electricity\). 

 For over a decade, **an IC group including Professors Nigel Brandon and Anthony Kucernak** has been developing stable, cost\-effective hybrid redox flow cells \(HRFC\) and regenerative fuel cells \(RFC\) for potential use in renewable energy grids. In a recent collaboration with the University of Warwick, the IC team showed enhanced durability and performance of HRFCs with hybrid electrodes consisting of electrophoretically deposited nitrogen\-doped graphene on carbon paper and economically sourced electrolytes \(including manganese or sulfur\) \[ **4**\]. In parallel to this work, Brandon, Kucernak and others have commercialised the technology through the spinout **RFC Power**. 

 Bacterial cellulose has potential use in novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, medicine, electronics and fabrics. In 2016, an **IC team including Professors Tom Ellis, Paul Freemont, and Richard Kitney** reported the development of a modular genetic toolkit that enables biosynthesis of patterned cellulose; functionalization of the cellulose surface with proteins; and tuneable control over cellulose production. This work laid the foundations for using genetic engineering to produce cellulose\-based materials, with numerous applications including novel high\-specificity water filters \[ **5**\]. Indeed, the work inspired the creation of **startup Puraffinity** which is developing a range of adsorbent media materials targeted to selectively capture and remove polyfluoroalkyl substances \(PFAS\) \- a global environmental challenge.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Transitioning to a net zero emissions economy was one of the focuses of the AtlantIC Alliance between IC, Georgia Tech and Oak Ridge National Labs \[A\]. In 2006, members of the group, co\-led by Professor Richard Templer, published the conceptual design of a near net zero industrial economy, underpinned by sustainable biopower and biomaterials \(see section 2\). To help bring this net zero vision to reality the team sought to create a climate\-change innovation organisation. In 2009, scientists at IC and ETH Zurich wrote a successful bid to fund an EU innovation partnership, the Climate Knowledge and Innovation Community KIC \(Climate\-KIC\). Professor Templer led and wrote the components on the creation of an Accelerator Programme and an allied education programme in the art of the efficient commercialising of innovation. 

 The IC\-based Climate\-KIC Accelerator, has been one of the most prolific programmes of its kind in this area. It ran from 2011 until 2020, with a total of €9.4 million of funding from the EU \(renewed yearly\) and has recently been awarded £5.9 million from HSBC and the European Regional Development Fund to run from 2021\-2025. 

###  Propelling clean tech solutions 

 Successful applicants received up to €40k each in seed funding from the Accelerator. Out of the 95 entrants to the programme, 64 have gone on to ‘graduate’ by raising over €200k investment each and/or achieving significant sales within 18 months. Collectively these startups have raised a total of $300 Million, creating upwards of 1000 jobs **\[B\]**. This represents a 67% success rate in raising significant funds and a 25\-fold return on initial public funding. Successful graduate companies include Lixea \(lixea.co\), Puraffinity \(puraffinity.com\) RFC Power \(rfcpower.com\) and SweetGen \(sweetgen.co.uk\) \(see section 2\). 

 Lixea was awarded €2.3 million \(£2m\) from the European Innovation Council in December 2019 in order to build a pilot plant to scale its innovative biomass fractionation process for the production of biochemicals, bioplastics, and biofuels from wood waste **\[C\]**. 

 Puraffinity received $3.55 million \(£2.8m\) from leading sustainability investors in 2019. This has allowed them to focus their PFAS water contamination solution on industries facing the most severe problems, such as airports, military bases and chemical manufacturing. Lead investor Kindred Capital commented: “We see their new product as a pioneering development which leverages chemistry principles in an advanced way to provide a solution to a key environmental issue.” \[ **D**\] 

 RFC Power has secured xxxxxxx  from investors including IP Group, who noted that “the market opportunity for long duration battery storage is already large and it is likely to grow rapidly over the next 10 years,” adding that “RFC can achieve a sustainable competitive advantage thanks to its two highly distinctive patent\-protected systems with lower levelised cost than current offerings.” \[ **E**\] 

 After winning the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Emerging Technologies Competition 2016, SweetGen has now completed a trials and demonstration period and focusing its abiotic wastewater fuel technology on the water treatment industry before expanding to different sectors including brewing, chemical and food and agriculture industries. \[ **F**\] 

###  Building a legacy in policy 

 Following seminal green chemistry research at IC and the success of the Climate\-KIC Accelerator, Templer was asked by the London Sustainable Development Commission \(LSDC\) to lead a team advising the Mayor of London on how to strengthen the growth of new clean technology \(cleantech\) businesses in London. This led to the ‘Better Future’ \(2016\) roadmap for the development of a cleantech innovation cluster **\[G\]**. 

 Better Future’s central conclusion was that both greater visibility and accelerated growth rate of the cleantech sector would be supported by the establishment of an innovation cluster. 

 To test some of the ideas within Better Future, IC chemists collaborated with partners including the Greater London Authority \(GLA\) and West London Business, through a European Regional Development Fund funded project – Better Futures **\[H\]**. This examined the effect of geographical clustering of a community of 56 cleantech businesses and the impact of technical assistance from IC’s researchers and postgraduate internships. 

 The influence of Better Future can now be seen in four major aspects of Mayoral strategy and policy – notably in the London Plan \(2017\); the Mayor’s Environment Strategy \(2018\); the Mayor’s Economic Development Strategy \(2018\); and Cleantech London \(2020\). 

 The London Plan is the key document defining binding policy and regulation for development in London **\[I\]**. In Policy E8, part F, it is written that “Clusters such as Tech City and MedCity should be promoted and the development of new clusters should be supported where opportunities exist, such as CleanTech innovation clusters”. This policy and recommendation follow directly from Better Future’s recommendations. Notably, the London Plan was approved by the UK Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government in January 2021 **\[I\]**. 

 The impact of Better Future in both the Environment Strategy and Economic Development Strategy is corroborated by a letter from Aram Wood \(Assistant Director, Energy and Environment Team, Greater London Authority\) **\[J\]**. 

 Aram Wood, Assistant Director, Energy and Environment Team, writes: 

 *‘The Mayor recognises that for London to remain an influential global city it must be at the forefront of developing the solutions to address the challenges of climate change. Prof. Templer’s contributions have been timely and important in helping us to determine how we turn these challenges into important opportunities.’* 

 *‘We have taken the ideas presented in Better Future and embedded them in Mayoral policy; they will continue to be influential policy until at least 2040; they form the basis for a significant part of London’s approach to addressing the climate emergency, and will be important in developing green and sustainable jobs for Londoners hit by the Covid\-19 pandemic.’* 

 Mayoral support for Better Future’s vision led to Templer working with the GLA to undertake a further study of how a cleantech cluster might be formed. This led to the development of the collaborative Cleantech London initiative **\[K\]** launched in March 2020. Its stated mission is to help London become a world\-leading cleantech innovation hotspot and Professor Templer now sits on the Board.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Postpartum haemorrhage \(PPH\) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide and is associated with low levels of the clotting factor fibrinogen. The Cardiff team validated a clinical algorithm to rapidly replace fibrinogen based on point\-of\-care testing. This research led to a new 4\-stage PPH care package now implemented across Wales. The package involves risk assessment and blood loss monitoring, alongside use of the point\-of\-care fibrinogen algorithm. This new treatment approach reduced progression to massive PPH by 29% and use of blood transfusion by 23%. The Cardiff research findings also influenced clinical guidelines, and in turn, clinical practice in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Massive bleeding during childbirth \(postpartum haemorrhage, PPH\) has doubled in the UK in the last 15 years, affecting approximately 5,300 women a year, resulting in >750 ITU admissions. Between 2014 and 2016, it caused 31 UK maternal deaths. PPH is defined as bleeding >500mL in the first 24 hours after childbirth, whilst massive PPH is defined as bleeding >2,500mL. The bleeding is caused by obstetric complications exacerbated by blood clotting abnormalities. 

 Management of blood clotting during PPH, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ \(RCOG\) 2009 Green\-top Guideline, was based on major trauma protocols \(e.g., the 2006 British Committee for Standards in Haematology Guidelines\). These protocols emphasised early replacement of clotting factors with infusion of fresh frozen plasma \(FFP\) and platelets, with fibrinogen only recommended if bleeding continued. 

 Between 2008 and 2018, joint Cardiff University and NHS research challenged this treatment approach as follows: 

 2.1 Accurate quantification of blood loss during delivery 

 During PPH, national guidelines recommend escalation of care to senior clinicians after specific volumes of blood loss. Cardiff research showed that standard visual estimation of blood loss resulted in errors of up to 1,500mL, even by senior staff. The Cardiff team validated a method combining gravimetric and volumetric techniques \(e.g., comparing wet and dry weights of standard delivery suite materials\) as a more accurate measure of blood loss during PPH. This was evaluated through an observational study of 875 deliveries where PPH was identified **\[3.1\]**. The study found that accurate quantification of blood loss using this method could be carried out in real time by junior staff, such as maternity care assistants **\[3.1\]**. 

 2.2 Rapid point\-of\-care testing for bleeding biomarkers 

 Low laboratory\-measured fibrinogen, recorded early during PPH, is a predictive biomarker for progression from moderate to massive PPH **\[3.2\]**. Fibrinogen testing, however, takes between 60\-90 minutes to return results, making testing too slow to be clinically useful in an obstetric emergency. In a prospective cohort study **\[3.2\]**, the Cardiff team found that a surrogate point\-of\-care test for fibrinogen \(FIBTEM\), generating diagnostic results within 10 minutes using a ROTEM machine, was an effective predictive biomarker for progression to massive PPH, identifying women who would need blood transfusion and surgical procedures to control bleeding **\[3.2\]**. 

 2.3 Appropriate use of fibrinogen and clotting factors 

 Cardiff research showed that during PPH fibrinogen falls to critically low levels earlier than other clotting factors **\[3.3\]**. In the absence of point\-of\-care fibrinogen testing, previous guidelines recommended empirical, early transfusion with clotting factors in the form of fresh frozen plasma \(FFP\), which resulted in many women receiving unnecessary transfusions. 

 Through a prospective, double\-blind, randomised controlled Cardiff\-led study **\[G3.1\]**, using the point\-of\-care FIBTEM test to guide targeted early fibrinogen replacement, the Cardiff team showed for the first time that a **fibrinogen level >2g/L** **\(or FIBTEM >11mm\)** **equivalent to standard non\-pregnant physiological levels** was adequate to control bleeding during severe PPH. This established for the first time an appropriate intervention trigger for blood product treatment during PPH **\[3.4\]**. 

 Cardiff’s research also showed that during severe PPH it is unusual for deficiencies of other clotting factors **\[3.3\]** or platelets **\[3.5\]** to develop, with over 90% of women having normal blood clotting, in contrast to trauma\-induced bleeds. Subsequently, findings from the randomised controlled study **\[G3.1\]** demonstrated that it was safe to withhold FFP infusions based on rapidly available ROTEM assays avoiding unnecessary infusions in many cases **\[3.6\]**. 

 Based on these findings, the Cardiff team designed a new integrated care package for PPH management which included more accurate identification of abnormal bleeding with timely escalation to more senior clinicians, and early, targeted, correction of fibrinogen using point\-of\-care FIBTEM testing \(see section 4\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Cardiff team designed and implemented a new comprehensive care package for PPH. This was initially developed in Cardiff, then rolled out across Wales in a national quality improvement programme called the Obstetric Bleeding Strategy for Wales \(OBS Cymru\). It is now being integrated into clinical practice in Scotland and England. The research also changed international clinical guidelines on PPH. 

 The new Cardiff\-designed PPH care package, developed at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff and Cardiff University between 2013 and 2015 **\[5.1\]**, involves the following 4 stages: 

1.  risk assessment of all cases on arrival on delivery suite; 

1.  quantitative measurement of blood loss during childbirth using volumetric and gravimetric techniques **\[3.1\]**; 

1.  escalation of care to senior clinicians at specified volumes of blood loss, with a senior midwife informed at 500mL, an obstetrician and anaesthetist required to attend at 1,000mL and a consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist informed at 1,500mL; 

1.  point\-of\-care FIBTEM testing and targeted, early replacement of fibrinogen and conservative use of FFP based on application of a standardised and validated algorithm **\[3.4, 3.6, 5.2\]**. 

#  4.1 All\-Wales implementation: OBS Cymru 

 The implementation of the PPH care package in Cardiff resulted in an **83% reduction in massive PPH** \(bleeds ≥2,500mL\). In addition, the number of mothers **requiring a blood transfusion fell by 32%, and transfusion of ≥5 units of blood and FFP transfusion both fell by 86%** **\[5.1\]**. Eighteen months after the end of the pilot, the overall incidence of massive PPH, blood transfusion ≥5 units or FFP transfusion was 2.8/1,000, compared to 6/1,000 elsewhere in the UK **\[5.1\]**. 

 Following the positive health outcomes seen with the care package, it was rolled out across Wales \(between January 2017\-December 2018\) in a national quality improvement programme \(OBS Cymru\) **\[5.2\]**. The programme included all maternity units in Wales, covering hospitals varying in size, complexity of cases, and staffing levels, and introduced point\-of\-care testing into every obstetric unit in Wales **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. The OBS Cymru care package led to major clinical health benefits in Wales as follows: 

-  By December 2017, the care package had been adopted by all maternity units with quantitative measurement of blood loss being used for 98% of deliveries **\[5.4\]**. 

-  Incidence of massive haemorrhage fell by 23% with a 29% reduction in women progressing from early to massive bleeding. This equates to 46 fewer women a year experiencing massive haemorrhage after childbirth **\[5.4\]**. 

-  The number of women requiring a blood transfusion fell by 23%; equating to 164 women avoiding transfusion each year, a reduction of 390 units in total blood transfused **\[5.4\]**. Further, massive blood transfusions \(≥5 units\) fell by 30% **\[5.4\]**. 

-  42% reduction in the number of women receiving FFP compared to standard guidelines, with no adverse effects on blood clotting **\[5.4\]**. 

-  29 senior clinicians noted that OBS Cymru had changed both individual and unit level management of PPH, including “awareness of ongoing blood loss” and “consistent management” **\[5.4\]**. 

-  Feedback showed that 95% of women felt well supported during bleeding **\[5.4\]** 

-  Although hospital stays were sometimes marginally longer \(1\-2hrs on average\), the care package itself was cost neutral across Wales **\[5.5\]**. 

 Following the success of OBS Cymru, the Welsh Government issued a Health Circular in 2019 \(WHC/2019/012\) requiring **all hospitals in Wales to embed the OBS Cymru care package into routine clinical practice** **\[5.6\]**. 

 The importance of OBS Cymru was recognised by the MediWales Innovation awards Efficiency through Technology Programme \(December 2017\), the NHS Wales Awards for Promoting Clinical Research and Application to Practice \(September 2018\), the NHS Wales Midwifery and Maternity awards for OBS Cymru champion midwives \(2019\) and the British Medical Journal Innovation in Quality Improvement Category awards \(June 2019\). 

#  4.2 Implementation of OBS Cymru practice across the UK 

 Following the positive outcomes observed in Wales, the care package was implemented across Scotland as part of the Scottish Patient Safety Programme **\[5.7\]**. The OBS Cymru approach is also part of a larger package of changes being implemented by NHS England to “ *improve the early recognition and management of deterioration of either mother or baby during or soon after birth*”, via NHS Improvement in England **\[5.7**, p.1 **\]**, the quality improvement body for NHS England. The package document lists key aspects of the OBS Cymru programme, for example, targeting clinical training “to promote 4\-stage PPH protocol” **\[5.7**, p.4 **\]**, and implementing “ *the use of cumulative gravimetric measurement of blood loss”* **\[5.7**, p.6 **\].** The package was implemented through the Maternity and Neonatal Safety Improvement Programme launched in July 2019. NHS England Trusts were split into three annual waves, with 44 trusts being supported to implement change in 2019, and a further 43 being supported in 2020; this schedule is currently under review as a result of COVID\-19 **\[5.7\]**. 

#  4.3 Changing national and international guidelines on PPH 

 Cardiff research additionally led to the following changes in guidelines and consensus statements: 

-  The British Society of Haematology guideline on point\-of\-care clotting tests, co\-authored by Collins, recommends using the OBS Cymru blood product treatment algorithm for bleeding after childbirth **\[5.8\]**. This is the gold standard care recommendation in this area of medicine throughout the UK. 

-  Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology \(RCOG\) guidelines on the *Prevention and Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage* \(2016 update\), which Collins assisted in developing, now state that **“** *A plasma fibrinogen level of greater than 2g/l should be maintained during ongoing PPH*” **\[3.2, 5.9\]**. Previous RCOG guidelines had recommended maintaining fibrinogen >1g/L during major PPH. 

-  Citing the RCOG guidelines, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists \(RANZCOG\) 2017 guidelines on the Management of Postpartum Haemorrhage \(PPH\) recommend giving “ *particular*” attention to fibrinogen testing by using point\-of\-care tests and providing cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate where the fibrinogen is <1.5\-2g/L **\[5.10a\]**. 

-  The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis \(ISTH\), a leading international organisation, recommended a more conservative use of FFP and platelets **\[3.2, 3.4\]** in its *Guideline on Management of Coagulopathy Associated with Postpartum Haemorrhage,* authored by Collins **\[5.10b\]**. 

-  The 2017 German PPH guidelines, compiled by the German, Austrian and Swiss Societies of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, cite Cardiff research **\[3.2\]** in their recommendation that: "" *a fibrinogen concentration <2g/l may identify those at increased risk for severe bleeding \{consensus of the committee\}*"" **\[5.10c\]**. 

 Through their research into measured blood loss and rapid point\-of\-care fibrinogen testing for PPH management, the Cardiff team created an integrated new care package which provided clearer, standardised methods for monitoring blood loss, aligned to the provision of more timely and effective treatment. This reduced the incidence of massive and life\-threatening PPH and the need for blood transfusion whilst preventing infusion of unnecessary blood products. The new care package was implemented across Wales, and more recently Scotland and England. The research findings also underpinned changes to international guidelines used to inform clinical management of maternal bleeding globally.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In an increasingly saturated and competitive sector, the need to create effective advertisements is a pressing challenge for charitable organisations and small businesses with limited marketing budgets. In response to this challenge, the Exploring Multimodal Metaphor in Advertising \(EMMA\) team, led by Professor Littlemore, have: 

1.  **Improved the reach and performance of a public health campaign**, leading to an **increased take\-up** of sexual health services; 

1.  **Increased the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns** of community and well\-being organisations in the West Midlands; 

1.  **Changed organisational practices** across the advertising industry, particularly in the West Midlands region. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The EMMA team explored the combination of metaphor and metonymy in advertising and measured their impact on the interpretation, speed of comprehension and general effectiveness of advertisements. This was the first broad\-scale empirical study of multi\-modal figurative language in advertising. It was innovative because it identified different variables influencing the success of advertising and also examined the interplay between these, tested them empirically and explored their emotional impact. To do this and implement their findings, EMMA — and subsequent collaborative workplace\-based projects — used qualitative interviews and biometric technologies \(such as electrodermal activity measurement and eye tracking\) to examine the extent to which people engage with figurative language and linguistic concepts in marketing campaigns. These methods allowed the EMMA team to articulate potential benefit of figurative language for social marketing campaigns, advertising agencies, professionals and businesses. 

 **Key research findings:** 

1.  In comparison with other figurative tropes and literal language, the presence of correlational metaphor, situational irony and visual hyperbole in advertisements increases their appeal \(RO1, RO2, RO4\). 

1.  Contrary to expectation, multi\-layered metaphors — which require viewers to interpret several ideas or relationships within the same message — are particularly effective for conveying complex messages and are understood more quickly than single layered metaphors \(RO1, RO2, RO4\). 

1.  Responses vary significantly according to nationality. This is particularly significant in super\-diverse contexts like Birmingham and the West Midlands. If advertisers, charitable organisations and businesses are sensitive to linguistic and cultural differences in people’s responses to figurative messaging in metaphors, local and international communities are more likely to benefit from specific, appropriate and effective advertising \(RO2\). 

1.  Metaphors that contain an ‘optimal’ \(intermediate\) degree of novelty are more likely to be perceived to be of higher quality and understood more quickly than those that are highly novel. Metaphors that contain negatively\-valenced vehicle words and infrequent vehicle terms \(in comparison with the topic terms\) are more likely to be considered high\-quality metaphors \(RO3\). 

1.  Metaphors that are novel, salient, are presented from a first\-person perspective, and involve motion, and references to the senses are more likely to be experienced on a physical level and thus to be more effective in advertising \(RO5\). 

1.  Advertisements containing figurative messages that require more work on the part of the viewer to get from the literal meaning to the figurative meaning in context are more strongly appreciated and are more likely to lead to take\-up of the product \(RO1, RO2\). 

1.  Bodily\- and environmentally\-based word\-colour associations are more likely than non\-bodily\- or non\-environmentally\-based associations to occur across languages and to be retained by users of a second language. They are therefore more robust and more likely to be effective in advertising \(RO6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(Note: Text removed for publication is indicated by \[REDACTED\]\) 

1.  **Improved the reach and performance of a public health campaign, leading to an increased take\-up of sexual health services** 

 Against a background of worsening sexual health at a regional level \(35,635 new sexually transmitted infection \(STI\) diagnoses in the West Midlands in 2017; Public Health England\) and sexual health service cuts nationwide \(resulting in 50% of UK women having “poor sexual health”; the *Guardian*, 9 January 2020\), EMMA **increased public awareness of the importance of sexual health** across the Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest Trusts in England. This increased awareness led to a **greater uptake in STI screening and services** and, ultimately, **increased diagnoses and treatment**. 

 Umbrella Sexual Health is part of the Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust and provides sexual health services across Birmingham and Solihull. EMMA’s research changed the approach of Big Cat, a marketing and advertising agency working with Umbrella, and in doing so directly shaped the tone of Umbrella’s July 2019 campaign in a range of online platforms and physical locations. EMMA’s findings suggested that figurative puns involving more cognitive dissonance \(RF1, RF2\), more movement \(RF5\) and more optimally creative metaphor \(RF4, RF6\) were more likely to lead to take\-up of their important messages. Big Cat incorporated these findings into the 

campaign and their influence is clear in the resulting adverts. 

 Figure 1: The photograph above shows a rotating billboard in Birmingham city centre at the busy Holloway Circus junction. The advert shows the words ""Exploring her botanical gardens?"" in capital letters. 

The Director of Communications at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust testifies to the importance of EMMA in shaping the campaign: “The research undertaken by the \[EMMA\] team and their input regarding the structure of campaign headlines and the effective use of metaphor, was instrumental in enabling the campaign to **raise awareness** of Umbrella Health, **increase requests** for free STI self\-sampling kits, and to **increase traffic** on the Umbrella website” \(S1\). Data from the final campaign that ran in July 2019, demonstrates significantly improved take\-up on previous campaigns via a number of success metrics: 

-  Increase in Facebook posts from \[REDACTED\] in 2018 to \[REDACTED\] in 2019 \(S2\); 

-  Increase in advert impressions from \[REDACTED\] in 2018 to \[REDACTED\] in 2019 \(S2\); 

-  Increase in visits by \~1000 to the ‘Appointments’ page \(which is the first step to ordering a kit or health check; S2\); 

-  Increase in number of STI kits ordered from Umbrella Sexual Health \(39% increase from \[REDACTED\] in 2018\) which represents the highest number of kits ordered in 2019 for one month in July \(S3\); 

-  Increase in kits returned for testing \(27.7% increase from \[REDACTED\] in 2018 to \[REDACTED\] in 2019; S3\); 

-  Umbrella have never had such a high distribution number of STI testing kits in the five years of records \(S3\). 



 Figure 2: The image above is an example tweet from the campaign from Umbrella’s twitter account. It shows a paused video with the words ‘Entering her Queensway Tunnel?’ in capital letters, alongside the caption ‘Steer clear of trouble with a free STI self\-sampling kit from Umbrella’. Posted 12 July 2019. 

In addition to increased take\-up, EMMA’s findings and recommendations resulted in **economic gains** for Umbrella; the substantial increases in STI kits ordered, returned and tested were achieved with a \[REDACTED\] decrease in budget, from \[REDACTED\] in previous campaigns to \[REDACTED\] in the 2019 STI campaign \(S1, S2\). It also marked a **change in practice** going forward, as the Director of Communications goes on to testify: “This research\-led approach has therefore had a **significant and quantifiable impact on the success of the campaign**. The incorporation of linguistic research was a **new a way of working** for Umbrella and we will continue to pay close attention to our use of figurative language” \(S1\). 

 **2\) Increased the effectiveness of the marketing campaigns** **of community and well\-being organisations in the West Midlands** 

 EMMA’s findings led to **significant improvements in marketing campaigns** for Big Cat’s other major social clients in the region, for example, Solihull Community Housing \(SCH\) and RightTrack. 

 
SCH is a not\-for\-profit organisation that manages the housing stock on behalf of Solihull Council and delivers housing services to the tenants of Solihull, West Midlands, which encompasses approximately 10,000 tenanted homes. EMMA’s work led to **major improvements in the SCH logo** — the company’s ‘key branding tool’ — which has been implemented across the website and communications, staff work\-wear, fleet of vans \(70\+\) and company offices. SCH reports that these improvements have led to an **increased number of website page views \(22%\), website visitors \(52%\) and new website users \(54%\), as well as a \[REDACTED\]** **growth in customer activity** \(S5\). 

 Figure 3: The photograph above shows two vans with geometric shapes in shades of orange, purple and green. 

The EMMA team achieved this by recommending that SCH branding should include complex figurative images containing multiple metonymic references to the services \(RF1, RF2, RF6\) provided in appropriate, bodily\- or environmentally\-based colour combinations \(RF7\); this was an approach “which had not been considered with previous SCH branding”, but which allowed SCH to “more effectively convey our organisation’s values” and thus better “engage and communicate with our customers” \(S5\). SCH went on to state that “\[c\]ollaborating with the EMMA team and Big Cat, has enabled us to explore and hone our new identity, make it more appealing, and facilitate discussions about our core values as an organisation” \(S5\). 

 RightTrack Learning is a Birmingham\-based company that provides training for organisations in areas such as equality and diversity, unconscious bias and employee well\-being. Following EMMA’s recommendations, RightTrack changed its online identity which led to **an increase in website views \(9.86%\) compared with the previous year** \(S4\). 

 EMMA research suggested that RightTrack should employ pairings of text and image that involve multiple, innovative metaphorical connections that nonetheless draw on an existing underlying relationships, as such messages are more likely to evoke positive reactions and increase the effectiveness of the website \(RF2, RF4, RF6\). The Lead Director of RightTrack attested that “The EMMA research **improved the website** as the findings gave us a better understanding of how figurative messaging can be utilised to deepen user engagement, and extend user time spent on the website”; he also explained how this “was an approach we hadn’t applied to our website previously” and thus allowed RightTrack to create something “more sophisticated and tailored to our strategic aims” \(S6\). 




 Figure 4: The image above shows a screenshot of RightTrack’s new website with white text that says “Face\-to Face or ‘Live Online’ Training Solutions” on top of a bright red and blue smoky background. 


 Given RightTrack’s market position, this increased website engagement means that more organisations in the region are likely to seek RightTrack’s services around equality, diversity and workplace well\-being. As Big Cat noted “for the business community in Birmingham this means that more companies are receiving the help they need” \(S4\). 

 **3\) Changed organisational practices** **across the advertising industry, particularly in the West Midlands region** 

 Using its ‘Metaphor by Design’ approach to apply the project’s research findings \(RF1– RF7\) to marketing campaigns, EMMA brought about changes to advertising and branding practices more widely. 

 Big Cat is a leading agency in the region, with a focus on fundraising, behavioural change, healthcare and education. EMMA’s collaboration on a number of projects — including the three outlined above — resulted in Big Cat **changing their approach** to clients by incorporating a more integrated focus on figurative messaging. The CEO states that EMMA’s “research and work on these projects has in turn benefited Big Cat itself, with an improved strategic approach to figurative language and its applications within branding identities and marketing campaigns \[…\] Our collaborative work has also led Big Cat to taking on a new member of the team, as a Cognitive Linguistic Researcher. This indicates a new dedication to embedding the EMMA team’s research into our organisational approach.” They now assert that their client relationships are “stronger than ever as a result of this value\-added offering” \(S4\). The success of this collaboration and the changes in practice resulted in EMMA and Big Cat winning the West Midlands ‘Partnership of the Year’ in the Birmingham Post’s Business Awards 2018 \(S7\), which afforded them “a level of recognition on a regional level we had not had before” \(S4\). 

 EMMA also brought about a **change in practice** at the West Midlands branch of the global marketing and communications agency McCann. By collaborating with the EMMA team and drawing on their research, McCann changed the way it conducts brand development, allowing for the optimal incorporation of figurative messaging at every stage from concept development through to testing; this in turn resulted directly in the organisation securing new client work \(S8\). The Head of Research and Development at McCann Central explained how they “are now systematically employing \[EMMA’s\] approach, which involves using corpus\-based analyses to identify figurative ways of thinking that are characteristic to different subgroups of a brand’s customer base.” He explained how the company has adopted this approach to secure a range of new client work, including the next round of research with Holland & Barrett \(worth \[REDACTED\] in Q1 next year\); he was clear that McCann “would not have had the level of impact on them had we not been working with you and your team.” Overall he concluded that “This increased awareness of the importance of figurative language has **shaped the global McCann approach** to understanding the meaningful role that a brand can play in people’s lives” \(S8\). 

 Finally, EMMA **raised awareness across the advertising sector** of the ways in which figurative messaging can be used effectively in everyday practice. This was achieved through the co\-creation \(between EMMA and Big Cat\) of Insight papers about collaborative projects designed to maximise the effective use of figurative messaging. These were published in the *CreativeBrief*, an industry\-wide marketing platform, which provides brands and agencies with ideas and resources for creating more effective work; the Insight papers are designed to showcase best practice and to raise awareness of innovative new approaches to addressing challenges faced across the industry \(S9\).

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study concerns the impact of a major AHRC funded research project, ‘Remembering the Reformation’, coinciding with the 500th anniversary of the posting of Luther’s 95 Theses in October 2017. The project has helped shape public understanding of the historical event now known as the Reformation by demonstrating the ways in which it has been remembered, forgotten, contested and reinvented since the sixteenth century. The impact was achieved through a major digital exhibition, educational activities and resources, engagement with curatorial staff in libraries, museums and archives, and public outreach through lectures, workshops, and media broadcasts. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Reformation is deeply embedded in scholarly and popular consciousness as a critical turning point in Western history. The AHRC project underpinning this case study investigated how a complex, protracted, and unpredictable process crystallised as a transformative event and a chronological landmark. An interdisciplinary cross HEI partnership involving the historians Alexandra Walsham and Cerianne Law at Cambridge and the literary scholars Brian Cummings and Bronwyn Wallace at York, it analysed the creative mixture of remembering and forgetting through which the Reformation entered into the cultural imagination. Using England as a laboratory, it explored how the legacies of the Reformation and conflicts over its memory have continued to galvanise, trouble and fragment English society. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw ongoing struggles to implement, perfect and overturn the religious changes initiated by Henry VIII and his subjects in the 1530s. During this period a generation of participants in the Reformation gave way to generations whose memory of them was formed not by personal experience but by texts, images, artefacts, rituals and inherited traditions. 

 The project also set these developments within a wider British and European perspective. Coinciding with the 500<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the \(possibly apocryphal\) event that is widely regarded as the initial catalyst of the Protestant Reformation, the nailing of Martin Luther’s 95 theses to the door of the Castle church in Wittenberg in 1517, it has helped to enhance understanding of the intersections between memory and identity formation in an international movement which crossed frontiers and bound together believers divided by borders, but which also took distinctive forms in different national environments. It has intervened in scholarly debates in the field of memory studies and fostered interdisciplinary approaches to the study of the Reformation. Through its outputs, notably public lectures and a permanent digital exhibition, it has raised consciousness about the Reformation as a project to reform memory itself, as well as the roles of commemoration, celebration, amnesia, and oblivion in that process. It has illuminated how a series of enduringly influential myths about the English and European Reformations came into being. These include its status as a crucible of modernity and, in the case of England, the genesis of the idea of Anglicanism as a via media and of the Reformation as an act of liberation from the tyranny of foreign Roman jurisdiction. In a context in which the Henrician break with Rome has sometimes \(misguidedly\) been invoked as a precedent for Brexit, the project has also cast a spotlight on the influence and agency exerted by historical nostalgia and misremembering through the centuries. 

 Exploring the biographical, temporal, spatial, material, visual, literary, liturgical and bodily dimensions of Reformation cultures of memory and their afterlives, the project has involved research in a range of archives, museums and libraries and collaborative work with their staff. It has led to significant published outputs: a major digital exhibition incorporating more than 130 items from Cambridge University Library, Lambeth Palace Library, and York Minster Library; two volumes of academic essays; a monograph **\[R6\]**; articles in scholarly journals and edited collections \(including **\[R3,5,6,&7\]**\), print and online publications in newspapers, magazines, and the project website \(https://rememberingthereformation.org.uk\).

1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has influenced how the individuals and institutions that mediate and communicate memory of English religious history view the Reformation as a moment of profound religious and cultural rupture. By engaging with non\-academic custodians and gatekeepers of collective memory, the project has raised public consciousness about how the Reformation has retrospectively been constructed as ‘an historical event’. It has contributed to fostering critical awareness of the confessional myths and triumphalist narratives that still surround it. It has underlined the plurality, complexity and contingency of the Reformation; the trauma and violence that accompanied it; and the continuities that mitigated the dramatic changes it wrought. It has enhanced awareness of the ongoing process of remembering and reinventing the Reformation past to buttress the present and to set future agendas, and drawn attention to the strategies of amnesia and oblivion that were integral to the movement. 

 **Shaping Public Understanding within Heritage Contexts and Faith Communities** 

 The activities and outputs of the Remembering the Reformation have attracted considerable public attention. Launched in front of a large public audience in September 2017, the digital exhibition, involving more than 130 items from Cambridge University Library \(CUL\), York Minster Library \(YML\), and Lambeth Palace Library \(LPL\), was accompanied by a physical exhibition at LPL in August\-November 2017, which was advertised and visited by over 2,000 people as part of the Lambeth Heritage Festival and Open House London and described as ‘fascinating’ and ‘instructive’ in written feedback **\[E3\]**. The digital exhibition has attracted more than 59,000 users from around the world, including France, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and the US \(who represent 35% of the total exceeding the figure of 32% from the UK\) **\[E1\]**. Use peaked at 1,300 page views on 31 October 2017, the 800th anniversary of the day that Martin Luther reputedly nailed his 95 theses on the door of Wittenberg’s castle church, an iconic event whose status as the birthdate of the Reformation the exhibition interrogated. In January 2020, over two years after the launch of the exhibition, traffic to the site accounted for 21% of all visits to the UL’s virtual exhibitions pages over the previous twelve months, a figure described as a ‘really amazing top line’ by the UL’s digital team. In March 2020, one of the items it featured – a bible embroidered by Mary Arbunot in the mid seventeenth century and preserved by her son as ‘the guift of my dear and tender mother’ – inspired a later descendant whose father was interested in the family’s history to visit the UL to inspect it. She described her tactile encounter with the book as a very moving experience, which created a physical link with past generations and with her distant ancestor **\[E9\]**. 

 The research has led to invitations to talk to non\-academic audiences, including Historical Association groups in Norwich and Canterbury, well attended public lectures delivered by Walsham in California \(May 2018\) and Melbourne \(March 2019\), and requests for advice from television producers. She was involved in several high profile events during the anniversary year, including a symposium at St Margaret’s Westminster on 31 October 2017, co\-organised by the Church of England and the Council of Lutheran Churches, at which she spoke on ‘Forgetting Luther’, which was reported in the national and US press. She also participated in panel discussions at The National Archives **\[E5\]** and the German Embassy. A podcast of the former has been frequently downloaded and the ambassador described the latter as a ‘deeply thought\-provoking insight into the perception of the Reformation anniversary in Germany and the UK **\[E12\]**. It set the scene perfectly for a look back at a decade of celebrations of the Luther phenomenon and forward to the further impact of Luther and his legacy today’. Attendees at a public lecture at LPL in November 2018 not only came away better informed about the ‘multiplicity of perspectives and contexts’ that shaped the Reformation; they were also inspired to ‘think about forgetting as a function of memory’ **\[E3\]**. 

 More generally, the project has shaped how faith communities understand and memorialise the divisive legacy of the Reformation. An ambitious day of family activities, organised in conjunction with Great St Mary’s \(GSM\), Cambridge, in late October 2017, saw some 3,300 visitors of all ages pass through the church **\[E6\]**. Visitors were able to print their own memorial broadside using the CUL’s historic wooden printing press. The day concluded with a dramatic historical re\-enactment produced by HistoryNeedsYou \(HNY\) with input from Walsham and Law, whose research shaped a script that was designed to disrupt celebratory Protestant assumptions and engage with new audiences. This collaboration was described as ‘invigorating’ by HNY **\[E7\]**. One attendee commended the multidisciplinary approach, which ‘really brings this seminal period and its fundamental issues of conscience to life’. A visitor from the Netherlands wrote that ‘my personal Reformation jubilee has become unforgettable’. His experience of the day inspired him to use it as a model for elements of the official Dutch commemorations of the Synod of Dordrecht \(1618\-19\), which he helped to coordinate **\[E8\]**. 

 **Educational Impact and Syllabus Enhancement** 

 The research underpinning this case study has also had a more direct educational impact at primary, secondary and tertiary level, stretching students and teachers beyond the National Curriculum and conventional syllabi. In addition to lectures delivered in secondary schools \(e.g. in Guildford and Bedford\), specially crafted sessions on Reformation visual propaganda and iconoclasm were devised for Key Stage 3 students as part of the Cambridge History for Schools programme in February 2017 and February 2019 **\[E2\]**. Participants commended them for ‘showing a different perspective of the event than when we study it in school’ and helping them to recognise how satirical representation in the sixteenth century has ‘links to modern times’. By re\-enacting the defacement of sacred pictures and finding to their surprise that this was ‘actually fun’, they gained insight into the mixed motivations of iconoclasts: ‘it is really cool and sad to see what happened in the past’. GSM’s outreach officer borrowed and adapted the first of these sessions for use in local Cambridge schools **\[E7\]**. 

 Widely used by university lecturers for courses on the Reformation, the exhibition has established itself as an excellent teaching aid, revealing fresh dimensions of familiar topics and engaging students with the material remnants of religious change. A colleague from Sussex describes it as a ‘brilliant’ digital resource and reports that the seventeenth\-century Luther and Calvin tobacco box led to stimulating seminar discussions about the ubiquity of the reformers’ images in consumer culture and about ‘the smell of the Reformation’. Described as ‘haunting’, mutilated liturgical books have inspired explorations of Protestantism’s deliberate project of selectively forgetting the textual legacies of the Middle Ages. 

 **Engaging Custodians of Memory: Librarians, Archivists, and Museum Curators** 

 This research has also afforded librarians, archivists, and curators important new insights into the collections they care for and shaped curatorial decision\-making and practice. Through its collaborations with CUL, LPL and YML on the digital exhibition, ‘Remembering the Reformation’ has helped to contextualise the early printed books and manuscripts they hold and illuminated the afterlives of medieval texts and objects that survived the Protestant onslaught against remnants of ‘superstition’ and ‘idolatry’. It has also underlined the extent to which such libraries and archives are themselves artefacts of Reformation memory: the disposal and retention of medieval texts was shaped by Protestant priorities and modern collections are thus shaped by acts of selective remembering and forgetting. The Librarian at YML indicates that the ‘overwhelmingly positive experience’ of working with the project team has been vital in fulfilling YML’s strategic aim to explore the values that shaped its collections, connect them to current issues, and interpret them for its users **\[E3\]**. A testimonial from CUL stresses the value of collaboration between readers and librarians, academics and curators, writing that it has ‘paved the way for a more cross\-institutional way of working, and provided tangible outputs around our collections for the international scholarly community’ **\[E3\]**. LPL greatly valued the ‘genuine dialogue’ between the project team and library staff, contributing to the latter’s professional development, and highlighted how the project helped highlight ‘how historical narratives of the Reformation have been constructed, adapted and refashioned, leaving material traces in books and manuscripts’. **\[E3\]** Cathedral librarians who attended our workshop on ‘Memory and the Library’ in June 2016 were inspired with ‘several ideas about how our collections might be used to engage the public’. Contacts with curatorial colleagues in the Fitzwilliam, Victoria and Albert Museum and Hamilton Kerr Institute have likewise enabled them to ‘reconsider selected objects in a deeper historical context, drawing out their significance in relation to changing attitudes to faith’, and underlining the importance of ‘reconstructing the original setting for which such objects were created’ \(the Rosalinde and Arthur Gilbert Research Curator, V&A **\[E4\]**\). Murdoch has subsequently consulted closely with Walsham regarding two forthcoming physical exhibitions on English Catholic material culture and ‘Making Time’. Walsham was also a member of the advisory board of the Auckland Castle Trust Faith galleries project, and two of its curators attended an academic workshop in October 2016, which ‘transformed’ how they planned to approach the galleries covering the Reformation era. 

 By challenging inherited assumptions that still colour perception of this iconic event and drawing attention to how it has been retrospectively constructed, ‘Remembering the Reformation’ has thus shaped how librarians, archivists, heritage professionals, faith communities, students, teachers, and members of the general public understand, communicate, and commemorate it.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘The impact of psychology and psychological notions in German history’ presents a portfolio of four types of impact deriving from Professor Anthony Kauders’ research. He has interrogated the history of interrelated psychological phenomena and practices \(guilt, psychotherapy and hypnosis\) in Germany. This body of work has: \(1\) informed public debates about Jewish life and community after the Holocaust; \(2\) influenced the design and delivery of educational curricula across the world; \(3\) enhanced cultural provision in collaboration with museum professionals; and \(4\) challenged conventional wisdom and stimulated debate among \(clinical\) psychologists and psychotherapists, thereby contributing to practitioner professional development in Germany. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since the early 2000s, Kauders’ research has focussed on the reception of psychology, the history of hypnosis and the ways in which Germans and Jews have confronted psychologically demanding conditions in twentieth\-century Germany. 

 *Unmögliche Heimat* \( *Impossible Homeland*\), published in 2007 with the financial assistance of the German Research Council, was the first archive\-based study of Jewish life in West Germany \(3.1\). It focused on one emotion in particular, guilt, and how guilt determined Jewish thinking and politics in the ‘land of the murderers’. This bad conscience not only distinguished them from Jewish communities elsewhere, but it also explained much of what characterized West German Jewry from 1945 to 1989: its economic structure; its especially close ties to Israel; its preoccupation with democratization; its power arrangements; and its communal life. What is more, by explaining the relationship between Jewish and German officials in the Federal Republic as a form of gift exchange \(Jews providing Germans with international credibility, Germans providing Jews with a symbolic role in the Federal Republic\), Kauders offered a novel way of understanding German and Jewish elite behaviour after 1945. The importance of this reassessment led the editor of the semi\-official history of the Jews in Germany to include Kauders in his international team of authors \(3.2\). 

 The next project \(3.3\), also funded by a major grant from the German Research Council, moved from specific emotions in the aftermath of the Holocaust to the reception of psychology more generally. *Der Freud\-Komplex* \( *The Freud Complex*\) was the first study to address German reactions to Freudian psychoanalysis in the twentieth century. It set out to trace these reactions as wider indicators of popular conceptions of selfhood, early childhood education, sexuality, and the unconscious. Kauders demonstrated a shift in perception from the initial rejection of psychoanalysis as a psychological method to the subsequent rejection of psychoanalysis as a ‘Jewish’ way of thinking. There was also a shift from early fears that the idea of the unconscious threatened bourgeois self\-control, to later concerns that the ‘creative’ unconscious be protected. The research revealed the degree to which a younger generation in the 1960s and 70s embraced psychoanalytical conceptions in order to create free, unencumbered human subjects. All these responses mirrored the hopes, anxieties, and worldviews of Germans in the twentieth century. More recently, Kauders has begun to research the history of hypnosis in Germany. As in his previous research, the reception of psychological concepts, models, and metaphors lies at the heart of his work. Thus, he has documented reactions to hypnosis in terms of gender and free will, including a form of binary thinking that pitted bourgeois male hypnotists against hypnotized effeminate masses \(3.4\) and as a discourse that centred on the perceived struggle, located within a particular ‘personality’, between an individual’s ‘character’ or ‘soul’ and the infiltration by a foreign or hostile force \(3.5\). This work involved editing two special issues of Germany’s leading journal on hypnosis and hypnotherapy \(3.6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Informing public debate** 

 *Unmögliche Heimat* \(3.1\) has shaped public debates on post\-1945 Jewish existence in Germany. *Unmögliche Heimat* became a recognised shorthand to explain and understand this community by journalists \(5.1\). For example, in a 2014 article German newspaper *Die Welt* \(circulation: 170,000\) described Germany as ‘the “impossible homeland” for Jews’, directly referencing the research; Austria’s leading daily *Kurier* \(circulation: 126,000\) ran an article in 2015 entitled ‘ *Die Unmögliche Heimat*’, citing Kauders’ research; *Kurier* also cited the book in an article in 2018. 

 *Der Freud\-Komplex* \(3.3\) was discussed extensively in German newspapers and magazines, including *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung*, *Merkur*, *Philosophie Magazin*, *Psychologie heute*, and *Literaturen*, and German/Austrian radio \( *Deutschlandradio*, *Bayern 2*, *SWR 2*, Ö1\) \(5.1\). The book stimulated debates within and beyond Germany, with extracts appearing in editions of *Scientific American* \(daily readership: 5,232\). In June 2019, the German political magazine *Cicero* \(circulation: 93,100\) interviewed Kauders on Freud and German culture. The subsequent front\-page coverage of Kauders’ text \(July 2019\) provoked debate, including one response by a prominent psychoanalyst in *Der Freitag* which prompted 144 comments from readers online \(weekly circulation: 23,500\) \(5.1\). 

 **Influenced the design and delivery of the curriculum in educational institutions** 

 *Unmögliche Heimat* has been used in academic programmes throughout Germany, Denmark, Canada, and the US \(5.2\). It has influenced educationists beyond universities. Sections from the work were published in *Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte*, ed. Federal Agency for Civic Education \( *Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung*\) \(5.3\). The *Bundeszentrale,* the State Agency for Civic Education in Hesse, and the Central Council of Jews in Germany all promote *Unmögliche Heimat* as recommended reading \(5.4, 5.5, 5.6\) and as such, it is widely used in high schools in Germany. In October 2020, the Federal Agency for Civil Education commissioned Kauders to write a ten\-page text on Jews in the Federal Republic that will be disseminated widely from 2021 onwards. 

 **Enhancements to cultural heritage provision and interpretation** 

 In July 2016, Kauders became the consultant for Europe’s largest Jewish Museum in Berlin on its future permanent post\-1945 exhibition \(3.1, 3.3, 5.7\). Kauders’ consultancy was crucial to the inclusion of key facets of German\-Jewish history in the display, including life in the Displaced Person camps, restitution, migration, the relationship between Jews and non\-Jews in the German Federal Republic as well as the connections between that state and Israel. All aspects have been integrated in the exhibition, which opened in August 2020. Museum leaders embraced Kauders’ recommendation that the controversial relationship between Jewish officials and German politicians be highlighted: curators reported that ‘ *his recommendations were crucial in translating our concept into reality’* \(5.7\). 

 **Challenging conventional wisdom, stimulating debate among stakeholders** 

 Kauders’ publications and presentations have facilitated practitioner reflection and debate on psychotherapy’s and hypnotherapy’s rich historical, intellectual and cultural contributions. The prominent practioners Marco Conci \(ed. *International Forum of Psychoanalysis*\) and Zvi Lothane \(psychiatrist Professor, Icahn Medical School, Mount Sinai Hospital, New York\) have actively promoted *Der Freud\-Komplex* in the *Forum.* Kauders has presented the book’s findings in front of large audiences \(80\-100 attendees\) at the International Psychoanalytic University \(Berlin\), Sigmund Freud University \(Vienna\), Sigmund Freud Institute \(Frankfurt\), and the German Psychoanalytical Society \(DPG, Munich\). 

 Practitioners in Germany have engaged extensively with *Der Freud\-Komplex*’s findings, resulting in invitations to Kauders to edit two special issues of Germany’s leading journal of hypnosis, *Hypnose\-Zeitschrift für Hypnose und Hypnotherapie*. These were the first volumes of *Hypnose* dedicated to historical themes. The work was also debated at a panel on Hypnosis in the Third Reich at the Milton Erickson Congress for Clinical Hypnosis \(2,500 members\) in March 2019 \(5.9\). 

 As was the case with psychoanalysts at the German Psychoanalytical Society \(DPG, Munich\), the 150 attendees at the Milton Erickson Congress session also claimed professional development training points from the German regulator \( *Psychotherapeutenkammer*\) \(5.8\). 

 The journal of the German Society for Dental Hypnosis \( *Deutsche Gesellschaft für Zahnärztliche Hypnose,* 2400 copies sold bi\-annually\), featured discussions on 3.3 \(5.10\), the Editor consequently commissioning Kauders to write a piece for the journal, which was published in August 2020 \(5.9\). In 2019, Kauders gave the annual address to the Milton Erickson Society \(Hesselbach\), the Chair of the Society noted that Kauders’ presentation ‘ *prompted colleagues who are normally preoccupied with the practical day\-to\-day use of hypnotherapy to engage with psychotherapy as a form of knowledge or ideology’* \(5.9\). In 2018, Kauders \(with four leading German historians of psychiatry\) was asked by the German Society for Psychoanalysis, Psychotherapy, Psychosomatic Medicine and Depth Psychology to oversee the research and publication of the history of the Society.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bastos and Mercea demonstrated for the first\-time how a network of social media ‘bots’ –automated accounts – were deployed on Twitter in the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign to artificially amplify electoral messages. Their research received extensive media coverage, stimulating public debate on the strategic electoral deployment and removal of bot networks. The coverage drew the attention of the UK Parliament to the research, which influenced parliamentary inquiries and subsequent legislation proposed by the UK government on the responsibilities of social media companies to tackle disinformation. Used by security services internationally to develop responses to state\-sponsored dis/misinformation campaigns, the research led to professional engagement with Twitter, which supported follow\-on research by the authors. 

  
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Recent City research is making transparent the ‘darker side’ or potential harms posed by social media including the use of algorithms and automated non\-human accounts \(‘bots’\) to game the social media attention economy. **\[3.1,3.4, 3.6\]** This includes ‘weaponising’ social media platforms for disinformation campaigns \(that is, the manipulation of information that purposefully aims to mislead or deceive\) and interference in political activities such as elections with wide\-ranging consequences for democracies, public policy, and ethical implications. **\[3.1,3.5,3.6\]**. Bastos and Mercea’s research was one of the first peer\-reviewed independent investigations into the relation of geographic location, in this case of Twitter users, and the circulation of social media content during a national political campaign, namely the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership \(Brexit\). **\[3.1\-3.6\]** An unexpected finding from their analysis was the uncovering of a ‘Twitterbot’ network active during the campaign that was then mostly deleted after the ballot closed. Bots are automated non\-human accounts designed to carry out specific tasks online. Through a combination of user activity metrics and an examination of temporal posting patterns that went beyond then conventional frequentist approaches to the study of bots, the research showed how bots acted as ‘sock puppets’, that is, false online identities used to voice opinions and manipulate public opinion. Notably, through rapid retweet cascades, the Twitter botnet was able to seed hyper\-partisan content, contributing to an ‘echo chamber’ effect **\[3.1,3.2\]**. This discovery was the first research\-based evidence in the public domain of a Twitterbot network at play during a UK political campaign. 

 The research focused on the two\-week period before and after the EU referendum vote, that is between 10 June and 10 July 2016. Around ten million tweets associated with the referendum were collected and over 800,000 unique users identified. The chosen methodological approach allowed the authors to separate out bots and uncover a botnet \(a network of internet\-connected devices\) comprising of 13,493 accounts that tweeted on the referendum, only to disappear from Twitter shortly after the referendum polling stations closed \(detailed methodological and ethical considerations were addressed in 3.1\). It is important to note that ‘sock puppet’ bots breach the terms of service of networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. 

 The botnet was effective at rapidly pushing out user\-generated ‘hyper\-partisan’ rather than ‘fake’ news that simplifies and spectacularises political news stories which, in turn, feed into polarised identities. The research evidenced for the first time how the botnet was subdivided into specialised subnetworks dedicated to ‘echoing’ through retweets content created either by other bots \(driven by algorithms\) or humans. **\[3.1\-3.6\]** 

 Exploring the geographic patterns of Twitter activity related to the Brexit referendum, within their wider project, the authors were able to show how ideologically polarised ‘echo\-chambers’ on Twitter mapped onto geographically\-situated social networks. **\[3.2\]** They designed a new approach for algorithmically identifying user location and political affiliation and, through a series of randomized tests, revealed a relation between echo\-chamber communication and geographic distance. Their analysis found that supporters of the Leave campaign were more likely to communicate in ‘echo chambers’ that were associated with geographic proximity. The opposite relationship characterised the Remain campaign, on Twitter. 

 Reflecting on their research **\[3.4\]**, Bastos and Mercea warn of the increasing ‘weaponisation’ of social media platforms and use of algorithms in which bots feature to try and game social media attention. However, their research finds no evidence to support the notion that bots had substantially altered the Brexit debate on Twitter. **\[3.4\]** Collectively, these research insights shed new light on how dis/misinformation campaigns can leverage social media features and network effects to rapidly scale up the dissemination of polarising content among susceptible publics. **\[3.5\]** The research demonstrates the need for ethical and transparent public research into social media dis/misinformation that maintains public standards of accountability **\[3.5, 3.6\]**, what Bastos and Mercea refer to as making “the invisible visible” **\[3.4, p.2\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The discovery of the Twitterbot network \(3.1\) and the public policy implications arising from this, had significant impact and reach in policy and public discourses about the role of social media. This falls into three areas of impact: \(1\) contributing to UK Parliamentary inquiries into the role of social media networks in dis/misinformation and the resulting changes in public policy leading to draft legislation and developing regulatory frameworks; \(2\) enabling national and international security organisations to form an understanding of botnets and the threats posed by social media to the integrity of democratic institutions; and \(3\) bringing these issues into the public spotlight and making ‘visible the invisible’ how social media platforms can be abused and social media companies operate. The public attention prompted Twitter to engage professionally with the research and ultimately to support its further development by the authors. 

 **4.1 Informing UK Parliamentary inquiries and policy in relation to social media platforms** 

 Bastos and Mercea shared their Twitterbot research exclusively with BuzzFeed News. \[ **5.1**\] The resulting article appeared on 20 October 2017 and explained in detail the findings and implications of the City research. Extensive media attention followed, leading  to multiple requests for the authors to explicate their research to multiple beneficiaries, i.e. policy makers, security agencies, media, and the public. 

 The BuzzFeed article included an interview with Damian Collins MP, the then Chair of the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\) Select Committee which was holding an inquiry into “Disinformation and ‘Fake News”. The City research on Twitterbot networks \(3.1\) was submitted to the inquiry and prompted Collins to take the unusual step of writing to Twitter UK \(19 October 2017\) and the Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey \(14 December 2017, 25 January 2018\) specifically raising the issue of the 13,493 ‘bots’ identified in City’s research and asking for more information about the extent to which there had been “interference” in the UK’s democratic process. \[ **5.2**, pages 85\-86\] Twitter later responded directly to the City research in a letter to Collins from the Head of Public Policy \(Twitter UK\) on 19 January 2018 confirming that Twitter had “conducted analysis on the dataset that City University provided in order to gather the specific information required to respond to your individual questions in full”. \[ **5.2**, p. 85\] The City research was further discussed in the oral evidence given to the Committee on 8 February 2018 \(held in Washington DC\) by Twitter’s Director of Public Policy and Philanthropy \(U.S. and Canada\) and Head of Public Policy \(Twitter UK\) \[ **5.2**, p. 101, Questions 479\-568\]. City is specifically mentioned in Q484 where Twitter acknowledged that academics do not have access to “the full picture” of user data. \[ **5.2**, p. 78\] The correspondence and oral evidence can be found in the Committee’s Interim report published on 24 July 2018. \[ **5.2**\] 

 The Committee’s Final Report on Disinformation and ‘Fake News’ \[ **5.3**\] was published on 18 February 2019 and its analysis and recommendations directly influenced the Government’s Online Harms White Paper \(WP\) \(published for consultation in April 2019\). \[ **5.4**, paragraph 1.25\] The WP makes explicit the Government’s concern about disinformation and alludes to a key finding from City’s research \(3.1, 3.2\) when it says “social media platforms use algorithms which can lead to ‘echo chambers’ or ‘filter bubbles’, where a user is presented with only one type of content instead of seeing a range of voices and opinions”. \[ **5.4**, paragraph 4\] In setting out the criteria for a ‘duty of care’ with respect to disinformation \[ **5.4**, paragraph 7.27\-28\] there is again clear resonance with the underpinning research \(3.1\-3.5\) when it is proposed to counter the ‘echo chamber’ by social media companies making clear to users when they are dealing with automated accounts \(i.e. ‘bots’\), ensuring that automated dissemination is not abused and promotes diverse news content. \[ **5.4**, section 7.28\] The Government’s response to the White Paper consultation \(December 2020\) confirms a single regulatory framework to tackle a range of online harms, including disinformation. An expert group will build understanding and drive action to address disinformation. \[ **5.5**, paragraph 34\] An Online Harms Bill to enact this policy is due before Parliament during 2021. 

 **4.2 Alerting security and intelligence services to state\-sponsored disinformation** 

 Closely related to the DCMS Select Committee Inquiry and forthcoming Online Harms Bill are growing concerns about state\-sponsored disinformation on social media, in particular Russian interference in Western democratic processes. In this context, the City research on ‘bots’ has been of interest to the UK Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee \(ISC\) and agencies worldwide responsible for national and international security and can be considered as a separate and further area of impact. 

 The ISC oversees UK intelligence and security activities and in November 2017 announced its inquiry into Russian activity against the UK. Ahead of a House of Commons debate on “Russian Interference in UK politics” \(21 December 2017\), two official briefings confirmed the focus of the ISC inquiry as “the more than 13,000 Twitterbot accounts that were active during the referendum campaign and were deactivated after the ballot” and referenced \(3.1\) in three places. \[ **5.6a**, p. 2\-3; **5.6b**, p. 17, p. 20\-21\] City’s research was cited in the Commons debate, with one MP describing a “13,500\-strong Twitter bot army”. \[ **5.6c**\] The continuing focus on Twitterbots was confirmed with City’s research \(3.1\) directly referenced in a House of Commons Briefing Paper \(26 March 2018\) on “National Security and Russia” \[ **5.7**, p. 8\) following the attempted murder of former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury earlier that month. When the ISC Committee’s Russia report was finally published in July 2020 it cited extensively the DCMS Inquiry, referring to Russia’s promotion of disinformation and attempts at broader political influence overseas, including significant bot activity on social media identified by “open source studies“ \[ **5.8**, paragraph 28\], and supported the DCMS Inquiry’s conclusion that “the UK is clearly vulnerable to covert digital influence campaigns” \[ **5.8**,paragraph 123\] 

 Based on their Twitterbot research, Bastos and Mercea were invited in 2017/18 to several private / confidential meetings with security agencies to explain their research insights on how disinformation campaigns by state\-sponsored actors and their impact can be tracked and evaluated. This included a joint Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies / UK Cabinet Office expert round\-table discussion on the impact of Russia’s influencing operations in the UK, meetings with NATO’s Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office. In the public domain, in November 2017, \[REDACTED\] Canadian Security Intelligence Service \(CSIS\) unclassified seminar: “The Security Challenges of Modern Disinformation”. Part of CSIS’s academic outreach programme, the seminar brought together a multi\-disciplinary group of experts from Canada, USA, and Europe. The  seminar was held under Chatham House rules and examined the strategic impact of disinformation on national security and the integrity of democratic institutions. A report entitled  [*Who Said What? The Security Challenges of Modern Disinformation*](about:blank) \[ **5.9**\] was based on the expert contributions and states baldly: “Disinformation poisons public debate and is a threat to democracy”. \[ **5.9**, p. 11\] The report includes a detailed case study on Brexit and the “rise and fall of a Twitter botnet” \[ **5.9**, pp 51\-58\], clearly based on City’s research \(3.1\). The report calls for “Raised public awareness… to distinguish the real from the false” \[ **5.9**, p. 11\] 

 **4.3 Initiating public debate on the role of social media networks and companies in dis/misinformation and the use of ‘bots’ in their dissemination** 

 A third key area of impact relates to how City’s discovery of the Brexit Twitterbot network led to a cascade of media attention putting pressure on Twitter to acknowledge this in public and respond to the DCMS Select Committee regarding the research \[ **5.2**, p. 78,  Question 484\]. Between October and December 2017, 220 national and international media outlets \(print and broadcast\) reported on the City research \(3.1\), including two articles in The Times on 31 October, which called for a change in UK law \[ **5.10a**\], and on 9 November which questioned the government’s approach to investigating fake news and Russian interference. \[ **5.10b**\] The high profile of the City research both in Parliament and international media prompted Twitter UK to respond to Damian Collins MP on 19 January 2018 \[ **5.2**, p.85\] confirming that a sizeable proportion of the botnet accounts identified by City were deactivated by the company because their activity was in breach of its content and spam policies. 

 Separately, Twitter asked to meet with Bastos and Mercea in late 2017. The meeting is subject to a Twitter\-imposed non\-disclosure agreement, but the company invited City to apply to its research programme for funding from a new scheme they had instigated into election integrity. Bastos and Mercea successfully applied to Twitter for £90,000 for research on “the Brexit Value Space and the Geography of Online Echo Chambers” \(1 April 2018\-31 December 2021\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Joining Technology Research Centre \(JTRC\) has provided substantial and critical knowledge transfer to YASA Limited \(Oxford, UK\), centred on the introduction of engineered polymer materials \(EPMs\) for reducing the weight of high\-powered lightweight electric motors, designed and manufactured by YASA. Key achievements over two successful knowledge transfer partnerships \(KPTs\) included: 

-  Improvement of the motor that enabled YASA to radically shorten production times, save material used and reduce defect rate, leading to significant cost reductions in motor production, and preparing the company for mass production. 

-  Increased high\-profile client base, through data driven assurance of motor performance, creation of assembly protocols, improved build robustness and reliability, and increased power demand potential of the motor. 

-  Development of new joining processes \(patented technology\) to accommodate the introduction of EPMs. This led to investigations for alternative novel cooling mechanisms that drove key strategic decisions for future motor design. 

-  Generation of predicative numerical tools to determine noise and vibration reductions for future motor development and diversification of motor applications, as a direct result of employing EPMs. 

 This all represented a huge step change for the company, leading to the successful mass production of subsequent YASA motor models, their take up in high\-profile companies \[text removed for publication\] and signing multiple long\-term development and supply agreements with automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer \(OEM\) customers, paving the way towards its inclusion in lower cost electric\-driven production vehicles.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The collaborative research and knowledge exchange between the Joining Technology Research Centre \(JTRC\) at Oxford Brookes University and YASA Motors involved three key technical strands: \(1\) adhesive development for dissimilar material joining; \(2\) novel heat exchange concepts; and \(3\) predictive dynamic modelling. 

 YASA, the Oxford based manufacturer of electric motors and motor controllers for use in automotive and industrial applications, was founded in 2009 by the CTO, Dr Tim Woolmer, to commercialise a permanent\-magnet axial\-flux electric motor \(YASA stands for Yokeless and Segmented Armature\). Having magnetic poles aligned axially enabled for a much narrower compact design that was also, and uniquely, liquid cooled. YASA electric motors typically are half the size and a third of the weight of conventional radial motors, including simpler manufacturing and integration processes. However, the construction of early prototypes was hand\-built, slow and expensive to produce, with a high fail rate, which led to considerable inefficiencies. A critical aspect to the novel motor design and significant contributor to these reported issues was the fact that almost the entire assembly of the motor relied upon adhesive bonding. 

 Professor James Broughton’s \(Head of JTRC\) underpinning work on adhesive joint design **\[3.1\]**, fatigue endurance **\[3.2\]** and durability test\-rig development **\[3.3\]** were all directly applicable to tackling the above issues. YASA approached JTRC in 2011, due to their knowledge and expertise, and access to specific equipment for solving joining issues related to lightweight composite materials. Specifically, JTRC were contacted to help develop YASA’s in\-house knowledge and capabilities related to adhesive technology, which led to the first KTP, entitled ‘Development of sustainable joining technologies for the mass manufacture of high reliability, high torque, low mass electric motors’ \(KTP008367, 2011–2013, GBP106,890\), funded by Technology Strategy Board \(TSB, now Innovate UK\). 

 Under the Principal Lead of Professor Allan Hutchinson, Head of Sustainable Vehicle Engineering Centre \(SVEC\), and supervision of Professor \(then Dr\) James Broughton, Head of JTRC, the partnership achieved several key objectives. These included: \(i\) new manufacturing process rules to reduce assembly errors; \(ii\) an improved bonding process that led to a reduction in potential defects \(motor robustness\); and \(iii\) a reduction in motor production times by implementing detailed design modifications that eliminated time\-consuming and expensive rework. In turn, this contributed to a significant reduction in the cost of the motor **\[3.4\]**. For future high\-volume production models, utilising lightweight ‘injection moulded’ engineered polymer materials \(EPM\) will lead to more sustainable motor designs with greater potential for recycling at end\-of\-life. Work was undertaken to investigate co\-bonding of EPMs using laser and heat welding technologies, and their effects on bond performance and durability; many of these materials exhibit low surface energies, which can translate to poor adhesion if not treated. This work developed solutions involving co\-bonding and over\-moulding technique innovations and led to the filing of three patents. The outcomes of this work received significant national recognition as the award\-winning KTP for Engineering Excellence and runner\-up finalist in the Best of the Best Award, Innovate UK, 2014. 

 The introduction of EPMs, however, had negative consequences, including increased noise, vibration and poor heat extraction. A follow\-on KTP project was formed, entitled ‘Development of a prototype axial flux motor using novel cooling technologies with the aim of providing a step change \(30%\) in power output’ \(KTP009387, 2013–2015, GBP94,587\), funded by TSB and under the joint supervision of Professor Broughton and Dr Stephen Samuel. Analytical models developed by Dr Samuel on heat transfer of IC engines **\[3.5\]** formed the basis for specialised models for optimising cooling and heat flow dynamics. One of the options explored was heat pipe technology \(HPT\) because of its simplicity and compactness. Experimentation evaluated various wick types and cooling fluid types to validate the models. The research delivered 12 technical reports on experimental, theoretical and numerical investigations into flow rates, coolant systems and fluids, wetting of wicks for heat pipes, and dynamics of heat flow **\[3.6\]**. Although the overall outcome established that HPT was not currently a viable option, the findings informed company strategy and diverted significant R&D resource to other areas. Preliminary frequency analyses also demonstrated limitations with the current aluminium cover of the YASA P400, leading to a sponsored PhD on the dynamics of certain motor components. This work immediately identified issues with the dynamic response of some motors and further issues that could arise with the introduction of EPMs for light\-weighting purposes. This work continues to guide YASA’s implementation of EPMs and re\-design of the motor to reduce noise levels and improve dynamic response.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Joining Technology Research Centre at Oxford Brookes University has been the source of invaluable expertise for YASA Motors. Two successful KTPs led to a significant increase in the technical and commercial capabilities of YASA and further contribution towards a lower carbon economy. 

 Currently, most of YASAs production of motors and controllers resides in the automotive sector, enabling automotive manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent emissions targets whilst delivering exciting driving experiences. In addition to automotive applications, YASA motors are used in defence, marine and aerospace sectors where high power density and torque density are critical. All these markets demand highly reliable, lightweight and robust motors, given the extreme environments these types of vehicles operate within. In 2018, YASA officially opened its 100,000 unit motor production facility. The Business Secretary, Greg Clark MP, who delivered the opening address said, “ *YASA is a brilliant example of what can be achieved when government, academia and industry come together to turn the best ideas from the best minds into scale\-up companies*” **\[5.1\]**. YASA is now well\-placed to capture significant market share within these sectors too and a significant aspect of this is down to the robust bonding technologies and company knowledge gained through the unique, on\-going, relationship fostered between Oxford Brookes University and YASA. 

 Initially, the partnership was sought to provide the capability to make high torque, low mass motors using injection moulding polymers with adhesive/composite bonds. Prior to the KTP project with JTRC, YASA lacked adhesive joining expertise, particularly relating to the design of interfaces and bonding of composite parts to proposed low surface energy polymers, as well as expertise in choosing or designing test methods suitable for testing such bonds against environmental and mechanical stresses, all needed for scaling to mass manufacture **\[5.5\]**. 

 With the first KTP focused primarily on production issues, there have been several significant impacts on the business. Dr Tim Woolmer, Founder and CTO, YASA Limited remarked, “ *The combination of expertise and equipment had attracted us to the KTP – but everyone here has been blown away by the results*” **\[5.2\]**. These main technological impacts were first introduced in 2013, where the company at the time recorded a revenue of GBP1,600,000. Issues directly linked to the bonding process were resolved, which meant defect\-rates had fallen by a factor of 100, saving almost GBP100,000 in avoidance of motor durability failures. The KTP Associate Jonny Biddulph conducted trials of new technology on injection moulded stator plates, where the outcome was a part\-cost reduced from GBP177 to GBP7. With two of these parts included in every motor this represented a significant saving \(GBP1,140,000 for 3,000 motors\) and allowed the joining of neighbouring parts by laser welding, further increasing manufacturing speed. The manufacturing process time reduced from 7 days to 2 days, potentially saving GBP16,650,000 \(reduced assembly time savings GBP18.50/hour production cost, based on predicted 90,000hours saved three years after completion of KTP\) **\[5.3\]**. From Oxford Brookes University’s first involvement with YASA in 2011, the company grew from 12 to \~150 employees in 2020, with a recorded revenue of GBP7,600,000 in 2018 **\[5.4\]**. This growth has been necessary to extend production rates from less than 50 motors per annum to a high volume capability of 100,000 units per annum **\[5.1\]**. This capability would not be possible without the key technology to deliver high\-volume over\-moulded bonded stator plates. 

 This KTP has subsequently proven instrumental to sustaining the growth of YASA Motors in the areas of materials and bonding technologies. On the back of demonstrating robust bonding procedures, the motors were adopted for the Jaguar C\-X75 supercar, dubbed ‘ *the most technologically advanced road car ever conceived*’, and on the strength of this YASA were shortlisted for the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders \(SMMT\) Award for Automotive Innovation **\[5.6\]**. Other high\-end sports cars have since adopted the technology, proving its capabilities in demanding environments. For example, the \[text removed for publication\] uses three YASA motors and, according to \[text removed for publication\], delivers the fastest accelerating, most powerful production car ever. \[text removed for publication\] commented: “ *YASA’s motors are extremely power dense, making them the key\-ingredient for the direct drive system. The torque capability of the YASA motors combined with our world\-leading engineering expertise has given the* \[text removed for publication\] *an acceleration capability that is second to none*” **\[5.7\]**. \[text removed for publication\], like many other OEMs are now also heavily investing in hybrid and electric vehicles, and have integrated seven P400 motors in their new \[text removed for publication\] supercar **\[5.8\]**. YASA electric motors also power \[text removed for publication\] first hybrid series production sports car, the \[text removed for publication\]. YASA have been working closely with \[text removed for publication\], developing a custom version of its electric motor that meets \[text removed for publication\] demanding performance specifications. The \[text removed for publication\] was launched by \[text removed for publication\] on 29 May 2019, in \[text removed for publication\] **\[5.9\]**. Such projects are often the proving grounds for the adoption of new technologies into more mainstream vehicles. 

 As a direct result of the KTP and the strategy to develop high volume production motors, three key international patents were filed by YASA and the Oxford Brookes University KTP research assistant. Patent EP3044854: Stator Plate Over\-moulding \(2014\) involved placing a resin membrane into a mould of an injection\-moulding machine and injection moulding a set of reinforcing features onto the membrane using a bondable thermoplastic polymer **\[5.10\]**. Patent EP3044849: Pole Piece Bonding \(2014\) uses similar technology for bonding the pole pieces using a flexible resin membrane. The resin membrane, which may contain woven glass fibre reinforcement, may be an engineering polymer material \(e.g. PPA, PEEK, PPS, ABS, PA\) wherein reinforcement inhibits the stator bars from pushing through the membrane. An additional thermoplastic polymer resin is used for supplementary bonding injection moulded reinforcing features **\[5.11\]**. Due to the high rotational rotor speeds that generate large centripetal forces on the rotor stages, particularly on surface mounted magnets, any loss of magnet adhesion is a risk for this motor topology. In order to combat this issue a third Patent, EP2773023: Axial Flux Motor \(2013\), was filed. It introduced a composite rotor for the axial flux motor, wherein the rotor holds permanent magnets circumferentially spaced around the rotor. An over\-winding of strands of reinforcement material are toroidally\-wound over the rotor and magnets. The strands help strengthen the rotor and provide a lightweight and high performance product **\[5.12\]**. Together, the technology behind these patents helped deliver the third generation P400 motors. 

 The technical transition towards the launch of the P400 R from earlier models is consistent with the dramatic increase in demand for low carbon emission technologies, driven by legislation and motivated by climate change. The P400 R Series is now manufactured using advanced materials and proprietary construction techniques that enable high\-volume production with significant customer cost benefits. An important innovation of the P400 R Series is the use of an engineering polymer housing for the motor stator, in place of the aluminium housing used in earlier models. The performance of engineered polymer material is strong, highly durable and lightweight, and is already in common use in volume automotive applications \(not motors\). Importantly, the materials used in the P400 R Series reduce both material cost and assembly time, the direct legacy of the first KTP. The low weight of the new polymer housing also helps to improve the overall motor performance **\[5.13\]**. Lightweighting also has secondary benefits that include reduced wear on components, reduced maintenance and an extension of service life. 

 Oxford Brookes University’s contribution to the development of these electric motors for mass production puts UK industry at a significant advantage to deliver on Government targets for total electrification of transport by 2050. An example of the broader reach of this technology includes the application of electric motors in the \[text removed for publication\] hovercraft, as bow thrusters to provide reversible sideways thrust for craft manoeuvring at low speed. With minimal modification, two YASA P400 motors were incorporated into the design of the hovercraft. The principal benefit of using YASA electric motors was that two of the four diesel engines could be eliminated from the design. This reduced the noise levels from the engines significantly, without adversely affecting the reliability of the craft **\[5.14\]**. Likewise, \[text removed for publication\] has completed testing of the ground\-breaking technology that will power the world’s fastest all\-electric plane. The plane is part of a \[text removed for publication\] initiative called ACCEL, short for ‘Accelerating the Electrification of Flight’.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Each year >500,000 women worldwide die of the disease. Aggressive treatment strategies have doubled breast cancer survival rates since the 1970s; however, it is now recognised that many of these patients are over\-treated, resulting in unnecessary long\-term side effects and healthcare costs. Cambridge\-led clinical trials involving >6,000 patients in >150 UK Centres have identified those breast cancer patients who can be treated with reduced\-volume radiation and reduced\-duration anti\-HER2 antibody \(trastuzumab\) therapy. This research has directly changed practice in the UK, Canada, USA, Europe and India, underpinning a global de\-escalation in breast cancer therapy that spares qualifying patients from unnecessary side effects, preserves excellent survival rates, and reduces NHS treatment cost by up to GBP46,000,000 each year. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women: 55,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the UK, and over 2,000,000 are diagnosed worldwide. The increased use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as therapeutic monoclonal antibodies e.g. trastuzumab which targets the HER2 receptor on breast cancer cells, have increased patient survival rates from 40% in the 1970s to >80% today. However, it is now recognised that many patients are over\-treated, causing serious unwarranted side effects and unnecessary healthcare costs. To address these issues, Cambridge researchers led a series of UK\-wide clinical trials to test if treatment can be reduced safely in women with certain forms of breast cancer. 

 **Reducing radiotherapy:** Whole breast radiotherapy is a highly effective treatment of breast cancer. But this treatment causes significant, long\-term physical and psychological side effects in up to one third of patients \[Coles CE *et al.*, Clinical Oncology 2005\]. A further 0.5 to 1% of patients suffer life\-threatening radiation\-induced secondary malignancies and cardiac toxicities. The 2007\-2010 **IMPORT Low** randomised controlled trial \(Coles was Chief Investigator\) recruited 2,018 breast cancer patients, across 72 UK centres. After surgical removal of the tumour, patients received either: standard full dose, whole\-breast radiotherapy \(control\); reduced dose, whole\-breast radiotherapy \(reduced\-dose group\); or radiotherapy to the affected area only \(partial\-breast group\). All three treatments produced equally excellent disease control, with 5\-year ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence rates of only 1.1% \(95% CI 0.5–2.3; control group\), 0.2% \(0.02–1.2; reduced\-dose group\) and 0.5% \(0.2–1.4; partial\-breast group\) \[1\]. Women receiving partial breast treatment also experienced significantly fewer side effects, with half as many women reporting moderate/marked changes in breast appearance compared with whole\-breast radiotherapy \(15% vs 27%\) \[1,2\]. Partial\-breast radiotherapy also halved exposure of the heart to radiation – a validated predictor of major, long\-term, cardiac side effects – in patients with left\-sided breast cancer \[Darby S *et al.*, NEJM 2013\]. 

 The 2011\-2014 UK **FAST Forward** trial \(Coles is a senior member of the Trial Management Group \[TMG\]\) demonstrated that 1\-week of whole\-breast radiotherapy is as effective in achieving local breast cancer control as 3 weeks of treatment \[3\]. By leading both the IMPORT Low and serving on the TMG of UK FAST Forward, Coles ensured that the control groups in both trials received identical radiation schedules enabling rapid and robust comparability between the studies. NHS England has invited Coles to work with them to implement 1\-week partial\-breast radiotherapy as standard of care for patients with low risk breast cancer. This represents a sea change in treatment and patient experience by reducing radiotherapy from 15 to just 5 treatments. 

 **Reducing targeted therapy:** Trastuzumab, given as a 12\-month course of treatment, has increased ten\-year survival rates for women with HER2\+ breast cancer from 75% to 84% \[Perez EA, JClinOncol, 2014\]. With funding from the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) Health Technology Assessment \(HTA\) programme, Earl led the PERSEPHONE randomised trial to test whether trastuzumab treatment could be reduced safely from 12 to 6 months among patients with HER2\+ breast cancer. 4,088 patients across 153 UK centres were enrolled. Four\-year disease\-free survival rates were equally excellent among patients receiving 6 months \(89.4%\) or 12 months \(89.8%\) trastuzumab \(hazard ratio 1.07 \[90% CI 0·93–1·24\]; non\-inferiority p=0·011\). These results were reflected in similar overall survival. Importantly, patients receiving 6 months of treatment experienced significantly fewer severe adverse side effects \(19% *vs* 24%, p=0·0002\) and significantly fewer of these patients stopped trastuzumab early because of cardiac toxicities \(3% *vs* 8%, p<0·0001\) \[4,5\]. Together, the research of Coles and Earl has validated the notion that breast cancer treatment can be safely reduced to decrease side\-effects and unnecessary healthcare costs \[6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Coles and Earl’s research has directly informed clinical practice, sparing major side effects for patients while markedly reducing healthcare costs. 

 <ins> **Impact on practitioners and the delivery of professional services**</ins> 

 **Changing national guidelines and practice for breast cancer therapy:** Cambridge research has had a direct impact on national and international clinical practice for the treatment of Stage I\-II breast cancer: 

-  As a result of IMPORT Low, NICE 2018 guidance for early and locally advanced breast cancer: diagnosis and management \[A\] states: *‘Consider partial breast radiotherapy \(as an alternative to whole breast radiotherapy\) for women who have had breast conserving surgery for invasive cancer \(excluding lobular type\) with clear margins and low absolute risk of local recurrence’.* 

-  UK Royal College of Radiologists breast radiotherapy consensus guidelines recommends partial breast radiotherapy for low risk patients \(patients 50 years with grade 1\-2, 30mm, oestrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative with minimum 1mm surgical resection margins and no lymphovascular invasion\) \[B\]. 

-  As a direct result of IMPORT LOW, regional NHS guidelines have been introduced by the North East Yorkshire and Humber Clinical Alliance and the West Midlands Expert Advisory Group for Breast Cancer, recommending the use of surgical clips on the wall of the tumour bed to enable partial radiotherapy as a standard approach, via increased accuracy of radiotherapy \[C\]. 

-  As a direct consequence of the PERSEPHONE trial, UK recommendations have been developed by an optimal duration of trastuzumab working group. In a 2020 survey of breast specialists, the majority \(78%\) agreed with 6 months as a standard option for those receiving single agent trastuzumab \[C\]. In addition, the 3,200 breast cancer patients treated with single agent trastuzumab each year in the UK could now benefit from reduced\-duration 6\-month treatment \[D\]. 

 **Changing international breast cancer therapy practice:** Internationally, the results of IMPORT Low have motivated numerous countries to change standard practice, implementing partial breast radiotherapy for low risk breast cancer patients. These include the Netherlands and Denmark, where national breast cancer guidelines have been changed to incorporate these new radiotherapy parameters \[E\]. IMPORT Low partial breast radiotherapy is now being used routinely in some of the largest and most technologically advanced cancer centres worldwide including: Australasia, Canada \(Princess Margaret Cancer Centre\), Canada Cancer Centres, and USA \(Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\) \[E\]. 

 <ins> **Impact on health and wellbeing of people**</ins> 

 **Reducing side effects for woman receiving radiotherapy:** The IMPORT Low trial demonstrated that women with low risk breast cancer can be treated safely and effectively with reduced\-dose or partial breast radiotherapy, causing fewer side effects than standard treatment. Importantly, this includes halving the number of women reporting marked changes in breast appearance or hardness that are associated with significant psychological sequelae. In the UK alone, 10,000 women per year are eligible for partial breast radiotherapy \[F\], which annually equates to 1,200 women spared physical changes in breast appearance and 500 patients spared breast hardness because of treatment \[1,2\]. Partial breast radiotherapy halves the mean heart dose for patients with left\-sided cancer, which reduces the predicted absolute lifetime risk of life\-threatening cardiac events to less than 0.5%, i.e. reducing from 50 to 25 such events per year \(DarbyS *et al.*NEJM 2013\). The reduction from 15 to 5 radiotherapy treatments will also have a positive effect on the patient experience, by minimising hospital visits and treatment\-associated side\-effects. 

 **Reducing side effects for women receiving targeted therapy:** The PERSEPHONE trial provides evidence for safe reduction of single agent trastuzumab therapy from 12 to 6 months. This reduced therapy, provides the same excellent survival benefit, but 5% \(365/1929 vs 460/1935\) fewer patients treated now suffer severe side effects and only 3% \(61/1977\) of women who receive 6 months of trastuzumab are likely to have to stop treatment because of heart problems, compared with 8% \(146/1941\) who receive 12 months \[D\]. Patients on trastuzumab most frequently report severe aches and pains \(9.3% \- 524/5610\) and fatigue \(8.2% \- 461/5610\), which can be minimised by reduced treatment \[D\]. 

 **Establishing therapy\-reduction research for patient benefit**:** Both IMPORT Low and PERSEPHONE were completed within the NHS Clinical Research Network with active patient advocate partnership throughout design, recruitment, analysis and dissemination \[G\]. The success of these two trials with non\-inferiority design, has been pivotal in establishing a priority theme of treatment reduction in National Cancer Research Institute \(NCRI\) breast cancer trials and has received consistent and positive feedback from doctors and patients \[G\]. Benjamin Smith, Professor of Radiation Oncology and Health Services Research at The University of Texas MD Anderson, said regarding IMPORT Low: “ *In my opinion, this is one of the most important articles on early breast cancer to be published in this decade*.” Maggie Wilcox, who is the patient lead for the PERSEPHONE trial, said “ *I am delighted to have been part of this landmark trial which is an important step to reduce the length of treatment whilst not changing effectiveness.”* Professor Hywel Williams, Director of the NIHR HTA Programme that funded the PERSEPHONE study said: “ *This is a hugely important clinical trial that shows that more is not always better. Women will now have the potential to avoid unnecessary side effects of longer treatment without losing any benefit. In turn, this should help save vital funds for the NHS and prompt more studies in other situations where the optimum duration of treatment is not known. It is unlikely that research like this would ever be done by industry, so I am delighted that the NIHR are able to fund valuable research that has a direct impact on patients*.” \[H\]. 

 **Extending excellence in care to Low\- and Middle\-Income Countries \(LMICs\):** Trastuzumab has had World Health Organisation Essential Medicine designation since November 2015. However, the cost associated with 12 months of treatment precludes its widespread use in LMICs where it is estimated that over 1,000,000 people are diagnosed with breast cancer; \~120,000 of these patients have HER2\+ disease. Demonstration by PERSEPHONE that 6 months of treatment are as effective as 12 months has increased directly the use of the drug in several LMICs, resulting in improvement in the uptake of this curative treatment \[I\]. IMPORT Low uses a simple technique and conventional, widely available radiotherapy equipment, so can be implemented in any centre worldwide. 

 <ins> **Impact on commerce and the economy**</ins> 

 Standard whole breast radiotherapy consists of 25 fractions over 5 weeks in many countries worldwide. Based on UK tariffs \(GBP159 per fraction\), a reduction to 15 fractions of partial breast radiotherapy saves GBP1,590 per patient. The 2020 publication of the FAST Forward trial has enabled seamless adoption of just 5 radiation fractions for partial breast radiotherapy in the UK and in countries where 15 fractions are standard of care. Around 10,000 women are eligible for partial breast radiotherapy per year in the UK where the standard of care is 15 fractions: this saves 100,000 fractions of radiotherapy per patient and a saving of \~GBP16,000,000 per year for the NHS. Each year the NHS treats \~3,200 women with 12 months of single agent trastuzumab \(GBP22,000/patient\) total \~GBP70,000,000\). The Health Economic Analysis in PERSEPHONE showed within\-trial cost savings of GBP9,793 per patient by reducing treatment to 6\-months of trastuzumab \[J\]. Patients receiving single agent trastuzumab, which accounts for approximately half of all HER2\+ cases, equates to an annual cost\-saving of \~GBP30,000,000 to the NHS.

##  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Professor Rob Klassen and his University of York team has improved the accuracy and efficiency with which candidates for initial teacher education \(ITE\) are assessed and selected, in both developed and developing countries. The team’s innovative suite of culturally\-sensitive, evidence\-based selection and development tools, has been adopted for live selection by institutions throughout the UK and Malawi, improving the selection process for student teachers in those countries by reducing the proportion who do not complete their training, and increasing the proportion who go on to perform well as practicing teachers. The tests are currently being trialled in Australia and Bulgaria. Klassen’s work has directly inspired a review of the current UK government position on the assessment of teaching applicants, and has been adopted by the World Bank as the model for developing a teacher selection test for Morocco. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Klassen’s research began with a focus on understanding teachers’ non\-cognitive attributes and what ‘effective teachers’ look like **\[A\]**. This led him to investigate how we can identify and recruit student teachers, with a view to optimising their professional experience and wellbeing, as well as the outcomes of their pupils. 

###  Teachers’ non\-cognitive attributes 

 Drawing on samples of teachers from Europe, North America, Africa, Asia and Australia **\[A\]\[C\]**, Klassen conducted a series of integrated studies exploring non\-cognitive attributes such as adaptability, empathy, and emotion regulation **\[B\]\[E\]**. In these studies he consistently found robust associations between such non\-cognitive attributes and teaching effectiveness. This contrasted with cognitive attributes, and other screening methods, which he and his team have found to be less predictive of teacher effectiveness **\[E\]\[F\]**. 

###  Teacher selection methods 

 Klassen and his team observed that the non\-cognitive attributes they studied are not reliably evaluated in traditional selection processes for trainee or practising teachers. In fact, they found that unlike professions such as law and medicine which routinely use systematic, rigorous and ‘values\-based’ recruitment and selection methods, education still commonly relied on methods that were not linked to key attributes, were rarely evaluated, and lacked validity evidence \(e.g., unstructured interviews, group tasks, personal statements, reference letters and generic personality tests\) **\[D\]**. Given that UNESCO predicts that almost 70,000,000 teachers need to be selected and trained by 2030 \(UNESCO, 2016\), Klassen and his team concluded that there was a clear need for new, more effective, evidence\-based and efficient selection methods **\[D\]**. 

###  Development of new teacher selection methods 

 Aiming to address this problem through the application of theory from educational psychology and methods from organisational psychology, Klassen made successful bids for a Canadian SSHRC grant \(CAD270,042, 2012\-2015\), and a EUR1,400,000 European Research Council Consolidator Grant \(2015\-2020\). He began the next stage of his research by conducting focus groups with practising teachers to identify key attributes and to develop content for situational judgement tests \(SJTs\). Intended to extend the classic ‘what should you do if…?’ interview question, SJTs \- based on implicit trait policy and behavioural consistency theories \- enjoy a robust research base developed over the last 20 years. The tests present test\-takers with a standardised series of realistic classroom scenarios, asking them to make quickfire judgements about what they believe they should do **\[B\]**. Initial evaluation showed that candidates responded favourably to the tests **\[B\]**, but that different scenarios and desired judgements would be needed for different cultural settings **\[C\]**. 

 On the basis of this evidence Klassen and his team went on to design bespoke SJTs for teacher training organisations in Malawi, the UK, Bulgaria and Australia, targeting key non\-cognitive attributes. In all cases, teachers and teacher\-educators from the host country or institution were involved as co\-constructors of the test framework – identifying the desired non\-cognitive attributes to be tested and creating the test specification. With support from their international network of collaborating researchers and practitioners, Klassen and his team have now developed a suite of evidence\-based selection tools including text\-based and video\-based SJTs, multiple mini\-interview protocols \(MMIs\), and ‘developmental’ SJTs \(aka ‘scenario\-based learning’\) used to assess and develop professionalism/classroom readiness in ITE programmes.

##  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Teacher selection and development tools designed by Klassen’s Teacher Selection Project \(TSP\) group have now been trialled in Malawi, the UK, Bulgaria and Australia, with 80,000 potential teachers estimated to have taken the tests to date, and adopted for ‘live selection’ in the UK and Malawi \(\~65,000 candidates\). This has brought about significant and measurable behaviour change within multiple individual institutions and on a national system\-wide basis. 

###  Malawi 

 SJTs developed by Professor Klassen were endorsed by the Malawian Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in 2017 and have since been used nationally for live selection at all of the country’s Teacher Training Colleges \(TTCs\). This means that the tests are taken by every single one of the country’s 12,000 student teacher candidates each year. 

 The Acting Director of Malawi’s Department for Teacher Education and Development writes: 

 *“The work was carried out with representatives from all eight of the public teacher training colleges in Malawi and with representatives from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and specifically the Department of Teacher Education and Development…* \[It\] *resulted in changed practice; namely, the adoption of situational judgment tests as part of the national ‘Aptitude Test’ to measure non\-cognitive attributes of applicants to primary teacher training colleges across Malawi”* **\[1a\]**. 

 Furthermore, Principals of TTCs in Malawi report that this fundamental systemic change in recruitment practice has led to improvements: 

 *“The SJT has greatly improved the selection of applicants in our TTCs … For instance, this year out of 777 students who reported for training only four have left* \[compared to 20\-30 before the SJT was used\] *… I am sure \(the\) SJT has contributed to this, that we have managed to recruit people who have easily adapted to the deplorable condition of the college, committed to the course as well as resilient.”* **\[1b\]** 

 “*So far we have been able to include the Situational Judgement Test \(SJT\) in the last two cohorts and trends are positive* … *the selection process is capturing those that are interested.*” **\[1c\]** 

###  United Kingdom 

 Since Spring 2018 Professor Klassen’s SJT has been used in the live selection of 40,000 applicants to Teach First – a teacher training organisation that already offers a particularly systematic and rigorous selection process. Recognising the *“critical need for the development and widespread adoption of research\-supported methods to select prospective teachers”,* Teach First’s Head of Selection says that Klassen’s “ *innovative approach… is both engaging for the applicant and effective… it provides an accurate depiction of the day\-to\-day role of a classroom teacher, motivating suitable candidates and allowing unsuitable candidates to self\-select”* **\[2a\]**. Data from Teach First candidates shows that the SJT is a better predictor of assessment centre performance \( *r* = .48\), than the essays \( *r* = .22\) that candidates are also asked to write as part of Teach First’s screening process. This represents an estimated potential saving of 2,000 staff hours spent essay scoring per recruitment round **\[E\]**. 

 In December 2019, after successful trials, Klassen’s SJT and MMI tests were adopted for live use by Strathclyde University, Scotland’s largest provider of teacher training with around 1,200 candidates per year. In October 2019 SJTs were adopted for use in ITE selection for 200 candidates at the University of York. The MMI tests have also been put to live use by York St John University to assess its annual total of 300 candidates. The academic responsible for candidate selection at York St John, says: *“The MMI has had a very positive impact on recruitment numbers: \[Applicants\] rated MMIs very highly compared to experiences at other providers. They explicitly stated… that it played a fundamental role in their decision to accept the offer of a place on the YSJ programme”* **\[2b\]**. Liverpool Hope University also moved from being a trial site **\[8d\]** to using Klassen’s SJTs for live selection, although this has been paused due to COVID\-19 restrictions. Analysis of data from Liverpool Hope’s selection process has shown that SJTs administered at the point of selection significantly predicted student teachers’ performance up to 18 months later, whereas existing selection measures \(interview, group activity, Maths and English skills audit\) showed no such predictive relationship **\[F\]**. Trials are on\-going at Stranmillis University College in Northern Ireland **\[8c\]**. 

 In October 2020, Professor Klassen was invited by the Cabinet Office’s Open Innovation Team to present his research and trials data at a workshop with the Department for Education and to serve as editor for a report to the DfE. In a follow\-up letter to Professor Klassen, the Head of the Open Innovation Team writes: *“Your research on selecting teachers, your written summary of your thoughts and your editorial role have led to the publication of a new report on assessing the quality of teaching applicants… Your contribution to that deep dive report has led directly to a recommendation to the Permanent Secretary and the consideration to launch a new departmental team to assess the quality of teaching applicants. This report has … led to policy meetings and a review of the current government position on assessing applicants”* **\[4\]**. 

 During the COVID\-19 crisis of 2020\-2021, developmental SJTs \(animated classroom scenarios, participant responses, reflection opportunities, and real\-time feedback from experienced teachers, also referred to as Scenario Based Learning \(SBL\)\) were developed and used as a replacement for in\-school placements for preservice teachers at Teach First, Cambridge University, and Liverpool Hope University. The Cambridge primary PGCE team reported that developmental SJTs *“enabled the trainees to reflect on their development in a non\-threatening environment… we are convinced of the impact of using SBLs within our programme”.* One student teacher commented: “ *The scenarios helped me think reflectively about my own/future practice with situations that are hard to prepare for when not experiencing them on placement”* **\[7a\]**. Australia’s Macquarie University also trialled Klassen’s SBL approach as a replacement for lost classroom visits during COVID\-19. They noted that: *“students were placed in ‘real\-life’ classroom situations in a low\-stakes setting, with real\-time guidance from experienced teachers. This is a rare opportunity”* **\[7b\]**. 

###  Bulgaria 

 Bespoke SJTs are currently being developed and trialled by Professor Klassen and Teach for Bulgaria – the team’s collaborating partner in Bulgaria. Teach for Bulgaria receives 2,000 applications each year for only 40 places on their training programme. Its Chief Program Officer strongly believes *“there is a need for the development and widespread adoption of research\-supported methods to select prospective teachers*” and it is expected that the organisation will use SJTs as part of its live selection process in the near future **\[3\]**. 

###  Australia 

 Bespoke developmental SJTs \(dSJTs\) are also being developed and trialled by Professor Klassen and collaborators in Australia. In 2019, 392 student teachers at the University of New South Wales used dSJTs as an Initial Teacher Education \(ITE\) programme ‘hurdle requirement’ to evaluate classroom readiness and professionalism **\[8b\]**, as did 700 students at Macquarie University **\[7b\]** and over 100 student teachers at the University of Wollongong **\[8a\]**. 

 As well as this immediate behaviour change, there is growing evidence of the impact of the new selection tools on performance during the teacher training programme – the first time that predictive links between selection and PGCE performance have been brought into focus for the institutions responsible for identifying and training future teachers. 

 A recent Education Commission report on *Strengthening the Education Workforce* highlighted the work of the Teacher Selection Project \(Case Study \#1\), as demonstrating *“innovative and effective approaches to workforce strengthening”*. The TSP work is hailed as *“one of the first international research projects to develop contextualized teacher selection processes supported by robust research evidence”* with the potential of *“increasing the attractiveness of the teaching profession through the rigor and selectivity of the \(selection\) process”* **\[5\]**. 

###  Commercialisation 

 In May 2019 Professor Klassen and his team were awarded a ‘Proof of Concept’ grant of EUR150,000 by the European Research Council to investigate the commercial potential for their teacher selection tools. The potential sustainability and range of this impact is exemplified by Professor Klassen’s new partnership with a UK\-based SME to work with the World Bank to develop teacher selection tools for the Moroccan Ministry of Education. In December 2020 the team were selected to join the Aspect Research Commercialisation \(ARC\) Accelerator programme, designed to support researchers in the social sciences to develop commercial ventures based on their research.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Sheffield’s innovative research integrating tissue culture techniques with ocular surgery has led to a new treatment for blindness caused by ocular burns, called simple limbal epithelial transplant \(SLET\). To date 1,291 children and adults, across 14 countries in Asia, Europe, North and South America, have had their eyesight saved. SLET removes the need for dedicated clinical grade tissue culture facilities, results in improved patient outcomes and treatment accessibility, and a 90% reduction in treatment costs \(INR400m saved in India\). Furthermore, by providing new skills and treatment strategies to ophthalmologists, SLET has enabled them to treat more patients since August 2013 than with existing procedures over the past 20 years. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Limbal stem cells ensure the avascularity and transparency of the cornea whilst preventing conjunctival epithelium cells \(the white of the eye\) from growing over the cornea. Limbal stem cell deficiency \(LSCD\) involves dysfunction or loss of these stem cells, ultimately resulting in blindness. Chemical and thermal burns are a primary cause of LSCD. In the EU, this only occurs in 30 people per million; in developing countries this domestic and workplace hazard is far more common and, for example, is estimated to have affected 1.5 million adults and children in India. 

 Since the 1990’s, LSCD has been treated with conjunctival\-limbal autograft \(CLAU\) which is a simple procedure but has a high risk \(16%\) of eyesight loss in both healthy and damaged eyes, and cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation \(CLET\) which is more complex and expensive procedure \(a single European CLET treatment in costs £80,000 \+VAT\). 

 In 2003, research by Sheffield’s Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering research group, led by Professor Sheila MacNeil, investigated the treatment of skin burns and non\-healing wounds without the need to grow layers of epithelial cells. MacNeil showed that transferring sub\-confluent populations of keratinocytes using an acrylic acid coated silicone carrier dressing worked as well as culturing cells into a continuous stratified layer **\[R1\]**. The dressing was successfully commercialised \(MySkin\) and proved to be a simpler and more robust method for delivering patient's own skin cells from the laboratory to patients in the clinic **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 Based on these insights and collaborating with India’s leading ophthalmology hospital, LV Prasad Eye Institute \(LVPEI\), MacNeil and Deshpande conducted research with synthetic alternatives to the human amniotic membrane used as a temporary dressing to deliver patient’s cultured limbal stem cells to the cornea **\[R4\]**. During this time, MacNeil questioned the need to culture the limbal stem cells in a laboratory and hypothesised the possible transplantation of small pieces of tissue from the healthy eye directly into the affected eye of unilateral LSCD sufferers **\[S3\]**. MacNeil’s prior experience of successfully translating the Sheffield skin repair research from the benchtop to the clinic now led to the development of a new approach to LSCD that essentially mitigated the risk of CLAU and the costs of CLET. 

 Working in close collaboration with LVPEI clinicians, MacNeil’s novel approach SLET was developed into a new surgical procedure. A tiny 4 mm² strip of limbal tissue is harvested from a patient’s healthy eye, subdivided into 8\-10 stem cell explants, and evenly distributed over an amniotic membrane. When placed onto the damaged ocular surface the cells grow into a continuous epithelium. This technique eliminated the need for *ex vivo* expansion and a second surgery associated with CLET, and it was quickly translated, by LVPEI, into a first\-in\-human trial \(6 patients\). Sight was restored within 42 days, with visual acuity improving from worse than 20/200 \(legally blind\) in all affected eyes to 20/60 \(near normal vision\) or better in four eyes.  These outcomes were comparable to CLET, but 2\-3 weeks faster and using half the theatre time **\[R5\]**. Figure 1 shows clinical photographs of a recipient’s eye before and after surgery.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sheffield’s research enabled the clinical uptake of a pioneering new treatment for blindness. SLET surmounts major socio\-economic and technical barriers associated with conventional techniques, increasing treatment accessibility for sufferers in developing countries. The World Health Organisation highlights that blindness causes removal from the workforce, deteriorating mental health, limited mobility, increased risk of accidents, and restricts child development. Restoring sight ameliorates these impacts for any individual and their dependants. 

 Chair of Regenerative Ophthalmology at the LVPEI in India stated *“This technique is now very much the standard of care in India. \[...\] The simplification of the technique has meant that it is more accessible to more centers and surgeons and hence more patients”* **\[S1\]**. The Director of the Ocular Surface Center at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in the USA commented, *“it can be done anywhere in the world as a same\-day surgery, you don’t need fancy instruments or ex vivo expansion in a lab”* **\[S2\]**. The Director of Innovation at Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital in New Delhi, India stated, *“there are less than 3 hospitals in India with established clean rooms suitable for CLET, whereas SLET is available to any hospital with trained surgeons”* **\[S3\]**. 

 Impact on the health and well\-being of people 

 Based on the enhanced clinical outcomes from the initial clinical study **\[R4\]** and the costs associated with CLET that limited patient access **\[S1**, **S3\]**, the LVPEI decided in 2013 to perform SLET instead of CLET **\[S1\]**. A recent review verified the enhanced outcomes with statistically significant higher anatomical success rates with SLET \(78%\) than CLET \(61%\) **\[S4\]**. 

 The LVPEI sees approximately 100 new patients every year **\[S5\]**. Importantly, new patients can be treated promptly with SLET, whereas when the LVPEI used CLET, the number of patients was limited to the number that the cell culture laboratory could handle. To date, LVPEI has undertaken more than 750 SLET treatments and the Dr Shroff’s Charity Eye Hospital has undertaken 70 SLET treatments **\[S1, S3\]**. 

 The international visibility of the success of SLET has led to its further uptake. SLET was voted the best limbal stem cell transplantation technique at the US ASCRS\-ASOA symposium in 2016 **\[S6\]**. A review of published clinical studies during the REF period reported outcomes for 92 patients in 13 additional countries spanning Europe \(the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Turkey, and Russia\), North America \(USA, Mexico, and Canada\), South America \(Brazil\), and Asia \(Thailand, China, and Japan\) **\[S7\]**. In a 2020, blind survey of the Ocular Surface group of ophthalmologists and the Kera\-net group, 135 different respondents from 17 countries reported a total of 1,291 SLET procedures, which was equivalent to the number of CLET and CLAU procedures combined \(172 and 1,134 respectively\) **\[S8\]**. 

 Economic impact 

 The research has enabled substantial cost savings for healthcare providers and patients. In India, cost is a major determinant of access to a treatment and costs are ultimately borne by the charity of the hospital **\[S3\]**. Table 1 summarises per patient total treatment costs of CLET and SLET at the LVPEI in 2020 **\[S1\]**. 

|| Total treatment cost | SLET cost saving per patient |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|| CLET \(INR\) | SLET \(INR\) | \(INR\) | % | \(GBP\) |
| Adult | 533,184 | 53,518 | 479,666 | 90% | 4,931 |
| Children | 564,337 | 69,136 | 495,201 | 88% | 5,091 |
| Average | 548,761 | 61,327 | 487,434 | 89% | 5,011 |

 *Table 1. Total treatment costs and saved costs per patient at the LVPEI for CLET and SLET. \(INR97=GBP1\)* 

 By adopting SLET over CLET, the LVPEI operating budget saves approximately INR49m annually, allowing more patients to receive treatment. Over the REF period, the application of Sheffield’s research has allowed the LVPEI and Dr Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital to realise combined savings of INR400m for the 820 patients they have treated. 

 Impact on healthcare practitioners 

 LVPEI’s active dissemination of the research via collaborative working, publications and presentations at meetings, and the provision of five annual international training workshops in India and Sweden \(2015\-2020\) has led to the uptake of the SLET procedure and enhanced the knowledge, expertise, and skills of clinicians **\[S9, S1, S3\]**. According to the results of the aforementioned survey **\[S8\]**, over 95% of surgeons were confident using SLET and commented that it is convenient, cost effective, efficient, reliable, and reproducible; 93% of surgeons stated that they preferred SLET over the CLET.  In addition, only 8% of the surgeons had access to the specialist facilities required for CLET. SLET has overtaken CLET as the preferred treatment for LSCD and helped more patients in the 7\-year REF period than CLET has in the past 20 years. 

 Overall, the global adoption of SLET has led to the restoration of eyesight of over 1,291 adults and children, with better clinical outcomes than traditional techniques, and at a 90% cost saving, ensuring broader access to treatment. It has influenced the practice of healthcare practitioners in 14 countries worldwide.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 
The BAFTA\-nominated documentary *From Scotland With Love*, commissioned for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, has become a key touchstone of Scottish cultural identity with over 85 cinema and 10 BBC screenings. Cited as ‘a new kind of history’, the film is engaging diverse audiences: the geographically marginalized; older communities; school children; new migrants; and the Scottish diaspora. The film is used in hospitals and care homes to benefit the mental health of people living with dementia and is acknowledged with providing access to a powerful “emotional memory” of lived experience. *From Scotland With Love* is cited by the Scottish Moving Image Archive as their ‘go to’ educational tool for opening up public access and cultural participation. The film is disrupting traditional film/music distribution models and creating a transferrable methodology for new films *.* 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Heath’s research enquiry underpinning *From Scotland With Love* focused on how to use cinema as a research tool, specifically constructed archive film with original music scoring, in order to investigate questions of national identity, memory and culture. Commissioned by Creative Scotland, it was one of several projects specifically created to engage the Scottish public with questions of cultural identity in 2014, the year of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and Independence Referendum \( **R1**\). Further funding was obtained from BBC Scotland \( **R5**\), and a collaborative partnership was formed with the National Library of Scotland Moving Image Archive \(NLSMIA\) with the aim of creating a landmark film to showcase their extensive archive to the public in this historic year \( **R2**\). 

 Heath’s research methods developed out of her past practice of repositioning and remixing historical archive footage to create new meaning in her documentary films. For example, in her documentary about South African Jazz, ‘Songs from the Golden City’ \(1996\) \( **R3**\), voice over narration from a white colonial perspective was stripped away to enable images of black musicians to be seen in a fresh narrative context. The process of making ‘From Scotland With Love’ drew on this method but presented a new challenge in that the entire 75’ feature film was created purely from archive images, music and sound design. As film director, Heath decided to exclude any narration so that visual images of ordinary Scottish people’s lives, woven together with music, would create an immersive cinematic space allowing audiences to bring their own memories to this poetic investigation of the past \( **R2**\) 

 Primary research was done during multiple visits to NLSMIA over a four\-month period, viewing over 500 archive films: from personal family archives, to ‘official’ government documentaries, to protest films, to advertisements, to B movie fiction films. Over 4000 images were selected as source material and arranged thematically in the edit room, using the analogue tool of the Post\-it Note. The film was structured according to the big themes of 20<sup>th</sup> century Scotland \- community, love, loss, resistance, war, emigration, work and leisure \- rather than by chronology or location. There was a focus on revealing the stories of ordinary working people \(no politicians or celebrities\), and particularly women’s hidden experience, in a kind of “poetic history from below” \( **R4**\). 

 The research approach used was to devise an iterative method of ‘writing’ the film involving Heath \(Project Lead\) researching and constructing archive sequences in close collaboration with the music composer \(King Creosote\) and sound designer, so both processes shaped and affected the creation of the other. \( **R4**\) Exchanging rough sketches that became more and more refined, the visual editing and musical composition became a dynamic, interactive process. For example, a key image of girls doing a flapper dance on the beach inspired the composer to devise the jazz tempo of ‘Largs’, and evocative images of fisher\-lassies inspired ‘Cargill’, a love song capturing the life of a fishing port from a female perspective. It was agreed that the song’s lyrics, inflected with Scots language, needed to work at an oblique angle to the visuals, so music would add another layer of meaning and dimension to the images. The sound design was specially recorded to create “in between spaces” where the images meld with sound atmospheres, leaving a space for reflection. The old industrial sounds, the banter of ship workers, fishermen, women canteen workers and children playing were subtly painted in the silences, so the half\-heard voices echo the sometimes ethereal images of past lives \( **R4**\). 

 During editing, Heath used the analytical discipline of dramaturgy, creating an ‘Emotional Temperature Map’ to shape the progression of themes, moods and feelings needed to create a 75’ immersive cinematic journey for an audience. The aim was to maximize engagement with the grainy, flickering, characters in the footage, their struggles, hopes and dreams. As both independent film and music industries face major challenges from online piracy, the research also created ways to join forces with Domino \(Record Label\) to access audiences directly via multiple platforms: live performance events; cinema and television screenings; home entertainment \(DVD and Online\); vinyl, CD and digital music formats \( **R6**\). The iterative research process was captured in a 40 mins ‘Making Of’ documentary, ‘Dreaming Without Sleeping’, screened on BBC Scotland 9/5/2020 \( **R4**\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *FSWL* had its World Premiere Screening with a live performance of the score to an international audience for the 2014 Commonwealth Games Cultural Festival in Glasgow \( **R1**\). BAFTA nominated for Best Single Documentary \(2014\), the film has been released theatrically in over 60 UK venues with audiences of over 27,000; performed live at the Edinburgh International Festival, Barbican, Celtic Connections \( **E2**\); and received 10 BBC transmissions reaching around one million viewers to date \( **R5**\). The film has reached an international audience via film festivals including Vancouver; Hot Docs Cinema, Toronto; Dublin; Chicago; Buenos Aires; New Zealand; Lorient; Stockholm; The Netherlands, and Hanoi, Vietnam \( **R4**\). It was described in the *Radio Times* \( **E2**\) as ‘a new kind of history programme: immersive, lyrical and, in its way, beautiful’ and by *The Herald*: ‘Brilliantly evokes the flavour of 20<sup>th</sup> century Scotland \( **E2**\). Heath’s creative approach to telling the collective stories of ordinary people has led diverse audiences to actively engage with the film, creating a wide range of beneficiaries and impact in numerous different areas. 

####  Audience engagement, identity, culture & memory 

 When *FSWL* premiered at the 2014 Commonwealth Games Cultural Festival \( **R1**\), its cinematic use of archive and music encouraged its audiences to reflect on their 20<sup>th</sup> century past and interrogate contemporary questions of Scottish national and cultural identity \( **E1**\). The Scottish Culture Secretary tweeted the live performance was “simply outstanding” \( **E2**\). This use of ‘cinema as research tool’, engaging audiences in debate and discussion, deepened as *FSWL* went on the ‘To See Oursels’ tour of culturally\-defining Scottish films prior to the 2014 Independence Referendum. “What better way to warm up for the referendum than a season of films exploring, if not shaping, Scottish Identity?” *The Guardian* \( **E3**\). From city cinemas to remote community halls, the tour enabled audiences in over 20 Scottish regions from The Borders to the Highlands and Islands to participate in vital discussions about what it meant to be Scottish at this crucial time \( **E3**\). For example, in the Glenelg Community Centre \(Highlands\), the screening inspired an exhibition of photos and letters created by school children who interviewed their grandparents, collecting stories reflecting their own history \( **E3**\). To date the film has reached cinema audiences of over 27,000 in 60 different UK venues \( **E3**\) and feedback can be found on the *FSWL* Facebook page such as: “It was a real privilege to see how people lived and worked…they engaged much more in shared activities, and they all looked happy when racing out of work” \( **E2**\) “So good it should be part of the National Curriculum in Scotland.” 

 *FSWL*’s significance as a cultural artefact is demonstrated by screenings at culturally\-defining events, including the opening of the new Forth Road Bridge by Queen Elizabeth II \(August 2017\); the National Museum of Scotland’s ‘Rip It Up’ exhibition \(November 2018\) on the history of Scottish popular music \( **E3**\) and repeated BBC screenings to mark Hogmanay or Burns Night \( **R5**\). *FSWL* has had international cultural reach via festivals to the Scottish diaspora in the US, Canada and New Zealand. For example, the NZ International Film Festival Director toured the film to six NZ cities in 2015, reaching audiences of over 3000: “I was moved and impressed by the potent combination of archival film and music and there are many more New Zealanders with Scottish heritage who will respond in similar fashion” \( **E4**\). When the film screened at Hot Docs Bloor cinema in Toronto \(2016\), comments posted on the *FSWL* Facebook page included: “Just saw this movie and absolutely loved it. Superb scenes and soundtrack. Thanks for paying homage to my fellow Scots in this way” \( **E4**\). In audience Q&As and social media comments, e.g. Domino YouTube channel with 591,000 views \( **R6**\), it is evident that the film’s reflection of ordinary people’s lives, rather than romantic “biscuit\-tin\-Scots” clichés, struck a chord: “Everyone at that time didn't care what they looked like, what they wore or how much money they had, as long as they had each other” / “What a beautiful piece of film \- making me feel all nostalgic even though I am not from Glasgow nor was I even born at that time\!” \( **E2**\) 

####  Impacts on Education 

 The Education and Outreach team at NLSMIA describe the film as their go to ""showcase for the emotive power of archive materials in increasing cultural understanding”. \( **E5**\) The film is used educationally with a wide range of age groups. Up to March 2020 the film was referenced at 56 Learning events at NLSMIA Kelvin Hall Access Centre, reaching 1225 participants. The ‘Film Detectives’ workshop uses the *Bluebell Cockleshell* sequence with school children to introduce them to a range of archive material and how films can be reused and remixed; the *Miserable Strangers* Emigration sequence shows how film and music can be used in an emotive way; and the ‘One Night Only’ dance sequence is used with College and University students learning the skills of Archive Research, Film Licensing and Curation. The film is also used to introduce Scottish culture and traditions to new migrants and asylum seekers “in a very light touch way” \(Outreach Officer\) \( **E5**\). The deliberate lack of dialogue ensures insights into Scottish culture and tradition, and the emotive aspects of the film are still accessible to those who do not yet have the vocabulary to express or discuss. 

 *FSWL* was also used by the Edinburgh International Festival’s Outreach Team in 2015 to inspire students from a deprived school in Edinburgh to make a film reflecting their own community, entitled *From Castlebrae With Love* \( **E5**\). This was screened at the EIF in relation to developing young talent, before *FSWL* screenings. 

 In 2017 Creative Scotland and Scottish Film Education obtained an educational license to use *FSWL* on the learning platform ‘Scotland on Screen’. A team of teachers, creative film practitioners from Creative Scotland, Scottish Film Education and NLSMIA collaborated to devise a series of creative activities to accompany the film clips. Up to December 2020 the resource was accessed 87,580 times with 38,060 sessions by users. \( **E6**\) 

 And now, in December 2020, a new Educational Resource ‘Raising Literacy through Scotland’s Film Archive’ is being launched for use in schools by NLSMIA, ‘Into Film Scotland’ \(backed by the British Film Institute\) and ‘Scotland on Screen.’ \( **E6**\). The resource explores issues of identity, heritage, culture, history and storytelling through archive sequences from *From Scotland With Love.* It is designed for teachers and young people to critically engage with their history and culture, appreciate the cultural value of archive, raise film literacy and, crucially, develop the skills to use film as an expressive medium to creatively represent their own communities. “The fact that it is a Scottish resource cannot be underestimated\! The resource is exactly how the Curriculum for Excellence intended learners to meet the experiences and outcomes because it is relevant, Scottish, engaging, immersive and interdisciplinary. The film is tender and carefully curated and from this the children will pick up that our past should be cherished and can be used by them to tell their own story \(Into Film Education Ambassador\) “I like that is all Scotland because it is where we are from and it could be our family members in that crowd” \(comment from pupil \( **E6**\)\) Testing the resource has proved successful: “It’s clear that the children are learning that these narratives ARE constructed – by someone for a reason. That is a hugely valuable piece of knowledge, you can actually see the penny drop with some children as they switch from being passive absorbers of moving image to actively thinking…this has been made by someone to make me feel something.” \(Into Film Education Ambassador\) \( **E6**\) 

####  Impacts on Mental Health and Dementia 

 A partnership between Screen Memories funded by the Life Changes Trust \(a charity supporting people living with dementia\), Alzheimer Scotland and the NHS has been recreating the cinema experience for people living with dementia, screening *FSWL* in over 70 Care Homes, Community Centres and Hospital Wards. In some cases, spectacular recall has left staff and family delighted: “It is a joy for staff to behold, driving us to ensure we are doing all we can for patients in acute hospital settings”. \(Screen Memories report **E7**\) *FSWL*’s non\-dialogue, music and archive approach is cited as particularly conducive to recollection of personal memories, creating a sense of community and inter\-generational sharing of experiences. Glasgow Film Festival 2020’s ‘Cinema For All’ strand programmed two ‘Movie Memories’ dementia\-friendly screenings of *FSWL.* \( **E7**\) In Q&As, dementia campaigner, Agnes Housten MBE, described viewing the film as ‘like dancing through time”, evoking a powerful “emotional memory” of lived experience. *FSWL* also inspired a community group with mental health issues in Govan to use film and music to represent their own community life, presented alongside a screening of *FSWL* with Q&A at the Scottish Mental Health Film Festival 2015 \( **E7**\). 

####  Preservation of Cultural Heritage & Increased Access to Archives 

 In a campaigning film \( **E8**\) the Head of Scottish Moving Image Archive states that *FSWL* is one of the best projects she has worked on. Heath was interviewed about the value of preserving archives for cultural heritage and public access, along with prominent members of Scotland’s contemporary cultural scene such as Kirsty Wark, Brian Cox, Ian Rankin, Bill Paterson. *FSWL* inspired a British Council initiative in Hanoi, Vietnam, \( **E4**\) leading to supporting FAMLAB film projects delving into Vietnam’s cultural heritage. British Council Vietnam commented that *FSWL* opened up “new ways of thinking and new approaches towards both archival footage and the symbiosis between film and music.” \( **E4**\) 

####  Impact on Film Making & Film Industry – Disruptive marketing and distribution 

 The non\-dialogue, music and archive approach for reflecting a nation’s history and identity has been recognized as a useful cinematic methodology. The underlying rights to this format have been licensed to a Norwegian company to produce *From Norway With Love* \(License signed, June 2019\).  Similarly, *We Are All Migrants,* a film looking at European migration via the EU Screen Archive Portal, also used the non\-dialogue, archive and music format as a good method for bridging linguistic and cultural barriers \( **E9**\). 

 *FSWL* was showcased at ""This Way Up"", Conferences for innovation in film exhibition \(2015 & 2016\), in the context of a crisis in cinema attendance posed by SVODS, Netflix et al \(and online piracy\). *FSWL* was presented as a cutting\-edge example of innovative film exhibition \( **E10**\) due to successfully targeting niche audiences though a pioneering approach to marketing the film simultaneously through cinemas, live events, television and DVD, along with Domino Recording. Publicizing the film alongside the music soundtrack \(CD, Vinyl and download\) with poster campaigns, Q&As and live performances achieved sales of over 20,000 DVDs in a very challenging market for independent film. The *FSWL* record went to no 1 in the Official Record Store Charts in July 2014 and was performed live with the film at the BBC6 Music Festival \( **E3**\). This multi\-platform approach was successfully repeated in March 2020 when a new tour of the film and live performance of the score sold out the Barbican and prestigious venues around Scotland to standing ovations, reaching audiences of over 10,000.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our game\-changing research, led by Professor Peng, is significantly influencing the design of engines for vehicles, boats and ships internationally, optimising their performance and reducing CO2 emissions. Studies into diesel engine fuel injection optimisation have helped shape the design of new Ford and Jaguar cars, cutting CO2 emissions by 15% and other harmful emissions by 20%. 

 We have developed solar boats and also pioneered the use of carbon capture and storage \(CCS\) for boats powered by internal combustion engines. This has paved the way for thousands of boats to be retrofitted with new technology, with a potential reduction of 21000t of CO2 emissions every year **\[Refs 5.1,5.2\].** Our ground\-breaking research around optimising engine intake systems has also influenced new engine designs in both the UK and in China. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research described has been led by Professor Peng. The studies aimed to explore and develop new technologies that both enhance performance and reduce harmful emissions from vehicles and inland ships and boats. This is helping to develop boats of zero carbon emissions and will contribute to a non\-carbon water transport. 

 Research focused on three key areas \- low temperature combustion for internal combustion engines; internal combustion engines and carbon capture and storage; and fuel cell electric powertrain technology. 

  

1.  Low Temperature Combustion for Internal Combustion Engines 

 Working alongside industry partner AVL Powertrain UK, the largest privately owned company for the development of powertrain systems, Professor Peng and his colleagues carried out investigations and numerical simulations to deliver more precise air\-fuel mixing for diesel engine combustion, optimising the fuel delivery process and injection strategies **\[Refs 3.1, 3.2\]** and leading to a reduction of CO2 and other harmful emissions. 

 Direct contributions to performance optimisation and emission reduction are evident in investigation results on HCCI, combustion or low temperature combustion for which fuel delivery process and injection strategies have been optimised. 

 Several research projects have been conducted with the  [State Key Laboratory of Engines of China](http://202.113.8.82/english/list.jsp?classid=201804241917354542) and  [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) into optimising engine intake systems with VVT/VVA technology and applying biofuel to reduce emissions **\[Ref3.3\]**, and relevant outputs from this research have been applied to new engine designs in both China and the UK. 

1.  Internal combustion engines and carbon capture and storage 

 Professor Peng’s research with Dr Tahmina Ajmal into internal combustion \(IC\) engines has made significant progress towards applying CCS to water vessels that are powered by internal combustion engines with conventional liquid fossil or biofuel fuels **\[Ref3.4\]**. 

 By developing oxyfuel combustion \(burning fuel with pure oxygen\) combined with HCCI \(homogeneous charge compression ignition\) combustion in IC engines, CO<sub>2</sub> can be filtered out and stored, so that the powertrain can achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions. Working with a consortium from five European countries \- France, Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK \- promising results have been achieved on inland boats, indicating that the technology has massive potential to reduce emissions if retrofitted to vessels. 

1.  Fuel cell electric powertrain technology 

 Professor Peng and Dr Vladimir Dyo conducted research on fuel cell electric powertrain technology for achieving zero emissions, including zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The research includes the optimisation of fuel cell internal flows of PEMFC \(proton exchange membrane fuel cell\) by optimising gas flow channel geometry and configurations and the development of a PEMFC dynamic model which is suitable for designing fuel cell powertrains for heavy duty vehicles **\[Ref3.5\]**. Both Research areas are aiming to improve the power density and energy efficiency of fuel cell stacks. 

1.  Solar boats without carbon emissions 

 Professor Peng has previously participated an InnovateUK granted research project, investigating a high efficiency solar PV system **\[Ref3.6\]**. Relevant outputs have underpinned the design and funding of a demonstrator boat in a recent collaboration with Mothership Marine Ltd for developing zero\-emission, solar\-powered inland boats.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our research reduces greenhouse gas emissions in roadgoing and marine transport sectors. Leading automotive companies are already reaping the benefits of improved designs to enhance vehicle performance whilst substantially reducing carbon emissions. Similarly, our work in China alongside Beihang University has far\-reaching implications, with recent results from industry showing our new engine designs save up to 20% in fuel. In the water transport sector, our developed solutions place us at the forefront of an initiative to reduce carbon emissions from narrowboats by 100,000 tonnes a year. Full details follow: 

 **4.1 Internal Combustion Engines: Impacts on Technology Development and Emissions Reduction** 

 Our numerical simulations and experimental investigations have delivered fuel injection optimisation strategies. As a close industry partner of the University of Bedfordshire, AVL Powertrain UK Ltd has applied these findings to its work on developing, calibrating and integrating combustion engine powertrains for its prestigious clients, including Ford Motor Company and Jaguar Land Rover. The research has also helped AVL expand its own business **\[Ref5.6\].** 

 An international collaboration with the State Key Laboratory of Engines of China and Beihang University has led to findings being applied to new engine designs in China and the UK.   For instance, a new design of RTO \(Regeneration Thermal Oxidizer\) combustor has been used by Yunhui Technology Ltd for their new system for processing VOC \(Volatile Organic Compound\) emissions. “Their test results show the new design can save fuel \(natural gas\)… \(by\)… more than 20%. This is really a great achievement from our collaboration,” Prof Yuzhen Lin, School of Energy and Power Engineering, Beihang University in a letter to Prof Peng **\[Ref5.3\].** 

 The results of our work enhancing in\-cylinder air flows and improving air\-fuel interaction in diesel and gasoline engines have been applied by the State Key Laboratory of Engines to diesel engines for the Guangxi Yuchai Machinery Company; and in gasoline engines for the Changan Automobile Company. Alternative fuels, including biofuel, have also been explored with the aim of directly improving the combustion processes and reducing fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions **\[Ref5.3\]**. 

 Our research on engine combustion \(including low\-temperature combustion\) has been carried out with financial support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council \(EPSRC\), the Royal Academy of Engineering and AVL Powertrain UK Ltd, and has involved substantial international and industrial collaborations.  Research outputs have also been adopted by AVL for commercial application. **\[Refs 5.3, 5.6\].** 

 **4.2 Impacts on Non\-carbon Internal Combustion \(IC\) Engine Combustion Technology Development with CCS** 

 The research on non\-emission water vessels powered by oxyfuel combustion IC engines and fuelled with conventional fossil or biofuel hydrocarbon fuels is financially supported by the European Interreg funding. Our research outputs are being applied by industry partners and were also disseminated at the SAE \(Society of Automotive Engineers\) \( [https://www.sae.org/](https://www.sae.org/)\) international annual congress in April 2020, where researchers and developers across the world joined to exhibit the latest technologies **\[Refs 5.1,5.2\]**. 

 By developing oxyfuel combustion \(burning fuel with pure oxygen\) combined with HCCI combustion in IC engines, CO<sub>2</sub> can be filtered out and stored, enabling the powertrain to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions, even though the engines are still fuelled with liquid hydrocarbon fuels \(fossil fuels or biofuels\). 

 A consortium from five Northwest European countries is working with the Canal and River Trust \( [https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/](https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/)\) to improve emissions from boats. The results from a single boat already demonstrated it is possible to reduce or eliminate the pollutants from the polluting vessel engines.  At the end of the project, results on the demonstration vessel showed that Nitrogen Oxide \(NO<sub>x\)</sub> emissions can be reduced by 194 kg per year and 24 tonnes/year on each narrowboat, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be avoided altogether. In the next 20 years, a European campaign through the network linked to this technology, involving inland water operators, national authorities and engine manufacturers, can potentially ensure that thousands of boats of various sizes are retrofitted with the technology, leading to a total reduction of up to 100,000 tons per year of CO2 emissions **\[Refs 5.1,5.2\]**. “We believe that the collaboration will not only benefit…...our business development, and the university’s research output, but also will make \(a\) remarkable impact on saving carbon emissions from water transport,” Chris Barnett, Enterprise Manager \(EU Projects\), Canal & River Trust, canalriverttrust.co.uk **\[Ref 5.4\]**.  As a result of this narrowboat experience, Professor Peng went on to work with Mothership Marine \(see \(4.4\) on a commercially available combustion\-free narrowboat. 

 **4.3 Impacts on Non\-carbon Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Powertrain Technology Development** 

 Future forecasts of CO2 emissions from the commercial sector are alarming **.** The sector’s share is predicted to increase from 27% in 2015 to around 40% in 2030. Professor Peng, Dr Dyo and Dr Gao’s research is significantly contributing to reducing CO2 emissions in the sector and is providing industry partner AVL Powertrain UK with opportunities to grow its business in the rapidly expanding electrified and fuel cell vehicle market, in particular in the electrified commercial vehicle sector. 

 We have been researching how to optimise fuel cell internal flows of PEMFC \(proton exchange membrane fuel cell\) by improving gas flow channel geometry and configurations and developing a PEMFC dynamic model that is suitable for designing the fuel cell powertrain of heavy\-duty vehicles. The research aims to improve the power density and energy efficiency of fuel cell stacks. With a collaborative project supported by Innovate UK, industry partner AVL is applying the results and designing improved fuel cell powertrains for heavy duty commercial vehicles. 

 AVL is also seeking to expand its business, engaging with commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers \(OEMs\), supporting them to develop fuel cell hybrid commercial vehicles from concept definition and fuel economy assessment to implementation. AVL expects to secure a project with an OEM within two to three years based on the outcome of our research, which will have a commercial value of several million pounds **\[Ref5.6\]**. 

 **4.4 Impacts on Non\-carbon Boats Powered by Solar Energy** 

 30,000 UK narrowboats are powered by diesel combustion motors, with resulting greenhouse gases. Prof Peng has partnered with  Mothership Marine \( [http://mothershipmarine.com/motor/](http://mothershipmarine.com/motor/)\), providing direct technical support for replacing these – designing, optimising and integrating a linked power ecosystem of E\-motor, gearbox and propeller and building this into a pilot boat.  Tim Knox of Mothership Marine reports “Initial results have led to increases in confidence with our customers. As a result, we have a full orderbook for the final product even before it has been demonstrated, and now need to take on more permanent staff to keep up with the demand” **\[Ref5.5\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof. Davies and Dr Gustafson were commissioned by the European Union’s \(EU\) Intelligence and Situation Centre \(INTCEN\) to design an annual training programme for analysts in order to create a body of professional practice that would serve as an INTCEN internal intelligence doctrine. The aim was to provide a suite of common operating standards and methods shared by INTCEN, the EU Military Staff \(MS\) Intelligence \(Int\) Directorate, and the EU Satellite Centre, for personnel from 89 intelligence and policy organisations across the EU. Following the adoption of Prof. Davies’ and Dr Gustafson’s research, INTCEN significantly improved the quality and impact of intelligence products and successfully provided a suite of common concepts for the 3 agencies. This resulted in improved working between INTCEN and EU MS Int analysts and promotion of common intelligence analytic standards and practices across the EU.

 <ins>Key Themes</ins> 

 The Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies \(BCISS\) is a hub for political\- and policy\-focused research into intelligence and security organisations. This work addresses a range of persistent and significant problems affecting the intelligence as a core function of government including: 

 **The Problem of Analysis –** Intelligence is commonly understood to mean information collected on targets actively seeking to conceal their capabilities and intentions. Information so acquired is, therefore, rarely comprehensive and subject to significant challenges in terms of truthfulness, accuracy and relevance. Consequently, there is a premium on interpreting, collating and fusing those sources as effectively as possible. This phase of *analysis and assessment* is the most likely aspect of the intelligence process to fail \(see, e.g. **Ref 6**\). Both Prof. Davies, then Senior Lecturer \( **Ref 1, Ref 2, Ref 3; Grant 1, Grant 4, Grant 5, Grant 6**\), and Dr Gustafson, then Lecturer \( **Ref 4**\), have examined challenges arising from organisational structure to managing effective intelligence community functions including analysis. 

 **The Problem of Culture and Intelligence –** Prof. Davies and Dr Gustafson, \( **Ref 3, Ref 6; Grant 1, Grant 2**\), have examined the significance of differing national and organisational professional cultures in intelligence \(‘intelligence culture’\) as both challenges to and facilitators of managing the intelligence process. 

 **The Problem of Professionalisation –** While intelligence cultures may vary there are significant common functional exigencies in the collection and assessment of intelligence. Regardless of national or institutional cultural variation, many if not most intelligence organisations in both the government and private sectors have increasingly found it necessary to articulate systematic professional standards of intelligence analysis and wider intelligence professional practice \( **Ref 4, Ref 6; Grant 2**\). 

 **The ‘Rest of the World’ Problem –** Most intelligence scholarship is concerned with the Anglo\-American developed states. Prof. Davies and Dr Gustafson have pursued an on\-going effort to understand intelligence outside the ‘Anglosphere’ engaging with the non\-Anglophone developed world, the ‘global south’, and authoritarian as well as democratic systems of government \( **Ref 5; Grant 1, Grant 5**\). 

 Key Findings: 

1.  The intelligence function in most governments deals with a common range of functional tasks and imperatives. However, these tasks and imperatives are often implemented in very different ways due to national variations in political and organisational culture \( **Ref 1, Ref 2, Ref 3, Ref 5, Ref 6; Grant 1, Grant 3, Grant 4, Grant 5, Grant 6**\). 

1.  Basic intelligence concepts and practices can also vary as much *within* national governments as between them. That variation typically aligns with differences in corporate culture and functional task between agencies and services. \( **Ref 3, Ref 6; Grant 1, Grant 3, Grant 4, Grant 5, Grant 6**\). As a result, variations in institutional intelligence culture can result in joint working difficulties as practitioners from different agencies work to differing basic concepts and conventions \( **Ref 3, Ref 6; Grant 1, Grant 3, Grant 5, Grant 6**\). 

1.  A significant international trend has been the ‘professionalisation’ of intelligence and intelligence analysis in general, largely shaped by US intelligence community developments in analytic methods, skills and procedures or ‘analytic tradecraft’ \( **Ref 3, Ref 4, Ref 6; Grant 1, Grant 2, Grant 3**\); however, the rate, degree and form in which analytic professionalisation has taken root in different countries has been fundamentally shaped by cultural as well as institutional factors \( **Ref 3, Ref 5, Ref 6; Grant 3, Grant 5**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Intelligence Analysis and the EU.** Cross\-cultural challenges to effective intelligence analysis have proven a significant difficulty for efforts to establish effective EU strategic intelligence support to the European External Action Service \(EEAS\) and EU MS delivered by INTCEN and EU MS Int respectively. Staffed by analysts typically on 4\-year rotations from the EU’s member states’ intelligence services, ministries of foreign affairs and central EU institutions. Seconded intelligence professionals alone come from 89 very different national and military intelligence and security agencies \( **S5.1**\). 

 Consequently, INTCEN officials found secondees to INTCEN ‘had been trained according to different standards … \[or\] …  had no training at all’ and most had ‘limited or no experience at strategic level’ and weak understanding of the intelligence\-policy relationship \( **S5.2, S5.3, S5.5**\). Furthermore, INTCEN had ‘no applicable \(or generally accepted\) intelligence analysis doctrine’ and ‘in the highly consensual environment of EU institutions’ requiring buy\-in from representatives of all 28 member states ‘there was little hope to agree a workable intelligence doctrine.’ The solution adopted by INTCEN managers was an ‘indirect approach’ in which ‘standards taught to new analysts would … become a sort of informal analytical doctrine for INTCEN’ \( **S5.2**\) that would draw eclectically on global experience and practices \( **S5.3**\). Prof. Davies and Dr Gustafson were commissioned to develop a detailed specification for the programme, as well as design and deliver it. 

 **The Brussels\-Brunel Partnership.** In a highly unusual move, INTCEN opted for an independent but still European provider for the new training package instead of the intelligence training facilities of one of the member states. According to then\-Head of INTCEN Analysis Division \(ANDIV\), because the EU ‘is based on the balance of forces between MS \[member states\], an academic team \(even if based in the UK\) would probably be perceived as more neutral than the training school of any of the \[national\] agencies’ \( **S5.3, S5.4**\). Reflecting the existing reputation and impact of Prof. Davies’ and Dr Gustafson’s research, key figures in INTCEN were already familiar with relevant BCISS scholarship on national intelligence cultures and the team’s findings on the cultural challenges to intelligence analysis \( **S5.2**\), as well as their work on the UK’s military Joint Intelligence Doctrine \( **S5.2; S5.3**\). BCISS were tasked with designing as well as delivering the proposed ‘informal doctrine’. The resulting INTCEN programme has drawn explicitly on Prof. Davies’ and Dr Gustafson’s work covering: 

1.  The comparative findings regarding the relationship between common intelligence functions and differing national intelligence institutions and cultures \( **Ref 3, Ref 5; F 1, F3**\) to provide relevance to a multi\-national, multi\-cultural and largely non\-Anglosphere cohort of analysts \( **S5.3, S5.5**\). 

1.  Transatlantic comparative analysis \( **Ref 1, Ref 2, Ref 3, Ref 5; F1, F2**\) to capture and communicate key features of American ‘analytical tradecraft’ \( **S5.2**\) and British strategic intelligence analytic working practices that INTCEN wish to emulate \( **S5.5**\). 

1.  Their experience in developing and articulating intelligence professional practice to identify and capture specific techniques and working practices \( **Ref 6; Grant 2; F 3**\) to form the basis of an INTCEN ‘informal doctrine’ \( **S5.2, S5.3**\). 

 After the leadership change in 2015, the new Director and Head of Analysis Division chose to continue the BCISS partnership \( **S5.5**\), despite the June 2016 Brexit vote and in 2019 even after the UK’s formal departure from the EU \( **S5.5**\).  Indeed, in 2017 the Brunel course was placed at the heart of a wider INTCEN ‘induction package’ \( **S5.5**\). The programme ran annually between 2013 and 2019. In July 2020, the new Director and Head of Analysis Division stated, ‘the very fact that EU INTCEN has systematically renewed the contract since 2013 and has extended the audience is a testimony of the good results achieved by the combined efforts of the two trainers, mixing smoothly theoretical and practical approaches’ \( **S5.5**\). 

 He has also noted the value of the BCISS course in ‘contributing to the strengthening of the …Assessment Staff’s corporate identity’ \( **S5.5**\). Moreover, the 2016 and 2017 iterations of the course ‘were pivotal in helping EU INTCEN’s new management to bolster reactivity and to change from a largely “academic” drafting culture to a more impact\-oriented and timely type of products’ intended to improve the impact of INTCEN products with EU policy officials. Moreover, with more than half of the INTCEN analytic workforce having taken the course ‘we could see extremely positive changes in drafting patterns, be it in conciseness and timeliness on one side but also in terms of presentation and argumentation on the other’ \( **S5.5**\). 

 **EU Impact Beyond INTCEN.** The INTCEN programme was delivered annually from 2013\-2019 and was not merely directed at new INTCEN analysts. From the outset, the intent was to use the INTCEN ‘informal doctrine’ to improve cooperation between typically civilian INTCEN analysts and those with military backgrounds at the EU Military Staff Intelligence Directorate \(EU MS Int\) \( **S5.5**\). Consequently, attendees on the course were drawn from the EU Satellite Centre \(SATCEN\) and policy officials from within EEAS. According to the Director and Head of Analysis Division ‘In only one week’ each year on the BCISS course ‘extremely useful common ground is built up and the good spirit prevailing in the course helps building bridges between analysts’ from both INTCEN and EU MS Int \( **S5.5**\). Moreover, involving policy as well as intelligence officials has helped compensate for ‘the very limited intelligence and security culture of most EU officials’ and users of INTCEN appreciations ‘have benefited from Brunel expertise’ \( **S5.5**\). 

 Approximately 20 INTCEN staff participated in the programme each year, resulting in approximately 120 personnel receiving training, most of them from INTCEN and EU MS with smaller proportions coming from SATCEN and EU policy departments. The programme, therefore, served to establish common operating concepts and standards across a range of EU intelligence and policy organisations. 

 An additional goal was to diffuse impact across the EU by exporting the concepts, practices and standards encapsulated in the INTCEN\-BCISS programme to the national intelligence communities of the EU member states. According to the previous Head of Analysis Division, European federalists have advocated closer integration and common operating standards across member states’ intelligence organisations \( **S5.3**\). Since ‘almost 30 European intelligence services have seconded analysts to EU INTCEN,’ the previous Head of Analysis Division expects that ‘INTCEN’s analytical and training experience may be having a certain influence on what some European countries are doing or planning to do in the field of training’ \( **S5.3**\). Although he has acknowledged that evaluating any such broader change is difficult \( **S5.4**\), the BCISS contribution here is the development of that body of common professional practice that EU officials hope to export to member states.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Polar Regions are transforming. Melting of sea ice and power struggles involving China, Russia and the United States are two drivers of change. The scale and pace of change is poorly understood. Dodds’ research used interviews, specialist roles and public engagement to reveal geopolitical trends and knowledge gaps in polar governance. The impacts of research are: 

-  Enhancing policy planning on the Polar Regions by providing specialist advice on futures and scenarios to Parliament and UK government departments including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) and the Ministry of Defence \(MOD\) 

-  Advising diplomatic professionals and government organizations to better understand the importance of drivers of change; 

-  Greater understanding and representation of the Polar Regions in the heritage sector, education and media. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research addresses key knowledge gaps in polar governance: uncertainties over the scale and pace of climate change, strategic intentions of third parties, trade and resource opportunities for the UK, and opportunities for polar science diplomacy. Increasingly, the role and intent of newer polar parties such as China, India and Korea are of ongoing concern to policymakers in the UK and US. 

 Led by Professor Klaus Dodds at RHUL, the research involved academics in Canada \(Professor Mark Nuttall \(University of Alberta\), UK \(Dr Richard Powell Cambridge, Dr Duncan Depledge Loughborough\), USA \(Professor Phil Steinberg Florida State University\) and Singapore \(Professor Chih Yuan Woon\). This research strategy made it possible to better understand the geopolitical dynamics of the polar regions, and the role that the UK as a non\-Arctic state could play in shaping commercial, defence, governance, and scientific agendas and priorities. 

  

 There are three main strands of research. The first focused on the drivers of change affecting the Polar Regions using interviews with policy\-makers and civil servants, high level participation in ‘closed events’, ethnography in the Arctic and professional engagement with UK and international stakeholders. Dodds and his team discovered was that there were not scrambles for territory and resources but there was evidence of concerted investment in knowledge\-generation, projection of influence and commercial investment. What was revealed was multiple futures; resource scrambles, ecological collapse, great power conflict, great power rivalries and new settlement/development \(R2 and R4\). 

 The second strand of research brought together researchers from around the world working on polar geopolitics and Asian polar geopolitics \(R1 and R6\). The UK’s polar community, academic and non\-academic, is scattered, and heavily biased towards the natural and environmental sciences, so the aim was to integrate the contribution made by social science and humanities, including heritage and education. This multidisciplinary approach revealed gaps in knowledge about indigenous communities and leaderships but also presented opportunities to build networks with newer polar actors. If policymakers and publics in the UK and elsewhere are ill\-informed about Arctic geopolitics \(including the fact that the Arctic is a homeland to 4,000,000 people\), encouraging the next generation of polar social science researchers is integral to improving understanding. 

 The research integrated academic knowledge into national level decision\-making and wider public cultures. It demonstrated that the UK government’s Arctic policy framework has been criticised by third parties for failing to take into account Scotland’s distinct Arctic interests, and not giving enough recognition to the defence and military imperatives in an era of Russian resurgence. The term ‘Ice’ was used to investigate how ice has become ever more politicised in an era of ongoing climate change. The research shows how Indigenous and western perspectives on sea ice and permafrost often diverge over how ice is conceptualised as risk, as critical infrastructure, as security challenge, and as a platform for environmental campaigning. 

 Dodds’ research was enabled by participation in parliamentary enquiries, research interviews with policymakers, professional engagement with UK government departments and NATO, high\-level invitations to participate in special programs, including Norway and the High North Study Visit in 2012, and participation in public engagement activities.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research revealed that there was an urgent need to better understand the scale and pace of geopolitical and environmental change in the polar regions. This was true not only within governments, but also in public settings, including the media, the cultural sector, and in schools. 

 The impact of the research is in three areas: Policy, Public Understanding, and Education. It is built on over a decade of collaboration with policymakers, UK Parliamentarians, professionals, and other academics. Beneficiaries include government agencies, parliamentarians, museum curators and visitors, teachers, and NGOs. 

1.  <ins> **Shaping Policy Conversations**</ins> 

 Dodds is an acknowledged and in\-demand expert in the field of polar geopolitics. His research findings are used by Parliament, specialist bodies, and the UK government. James Gray MP, Chair of the All\-Party Parliament Group for the Polar Regions: “ *there is no doubt that Parliament’s interest in the polar regions over recent years has never been higher… and this is in large part because of Professor Dodds’ many contributions*”. \( **E 1,** James Gray MP 4<sup>th</sup> July 2018\). He was appointed as Honorary Fellow by British Antarctic Survey in 2019 in recognition of \[text removed for publication\]. \( **E 7,** \[text removed for publication\] 25th April 2019\), and serves as UK representative for the International Arctic Science Committee’s Social and Human Working Group \(2019 to 2022\). This contributed to the polar social sciences being recognised as pivotal to future UK polar diplomacy and wider science policy planning. 

 Dodds’ research expertise led to his appointment as specialist adviser to the House of Lords Select Committee \(2014 to 2015; House of Lords Hansard 3<sup>rd</sup> November 2015\), and specialist adviser to the House of Commons Environment Audit Committee’s Arctic enquiry in 2019. The House of Lords used his research expertise to inform their understanding of Artic geopolitics: “ *His role was to give expert advice to the committee, help compile questions to witnesses \(including ministers\), ensure there were no blatant gaps in our work, prevent any errors of fact in our report, and give advice to me as chairman*” \( **E 2,** Lord Teverson, 23rd January 2017\). At the House of Commons Dodds research on international relationships with the Arctic states informed a report \(HOC, *The Changing Arctic* 2018\): \[text removed for publication\] **\(E 9**, \[text removed for publication\], 29th April 2019\) 

 These roles led Dodds to advise the FCO and MOD on polar matters, including invitations to participate in closed workshops and informal briefings \( **E1\).** In March 2020, Dodds was appointed to the DEFRA COVID\-19 futures advisory group after earlier briefings to DEFRA on Arctic futures in April 2019. Dodds participated in closed workshops and advised on DEFRA’s post\-COVID food security planning, with a particular emphasis on governance and global risk. 

 <ins>Policy Recommendations</ins> 

 Dodds’ public roles and advisory work helped to establish a new network of polar social science expertise dedicated to policy\-making. As a member of the House of Lords Select Committee, Dodds recommended that co\-ordination and collaboration with Arctic partnerships should be improved.  He advised the setting up of a new NERC Arctic Office to achieve this, a policy that was implemented in 2015. A workshop sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2016 brought together Norwegian, Canadian and UK stakeholders, and used Dodds’ research as the basis of a discussion paper at this  [significant event](https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Scenarios-for-Arctic-2045.pdf). The event influenced subsequent work by the MOD on Arctic futures. Dodds was asked to convene an expert group to write a follow up report. **“** *Klaus’s support and expertise throughout the study was invaluable. He helped develop the main purpose of the study, provide expertise and coordinate the contributing authors*”  \( **E 6,** Paul Norman, DCDC MOD 27th November 2017\) This MOD report provided the basis for the Chief of Defence Staff’s Strategy Forum in 2018 and developed a clear set of conclusions about the technological, environmental, resource\-led and geopolitical challenges facing the Arctic and how the UK would need to develop a more explicit Arctic strategy with security objectives such as evaluating the strategic intentions of China and Russia in particular. 

 Dodds’ research also informed the FCO Diplomatic Academy where junior diplomats are required to study his expert briefings on the South Atlantic and Antarctic presented in podcasts.  This is one example of how Dodds’ research is used in the UK to enable diplomats to better understand the geopolitical and historical context of lingering conflicts \( **E 6,** \[text removed for publication\] 24<sup>th</sup> December 2020\). 

 <ins>Briefing Parliament</ins> 

 Dodds advised the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology’s  [parliamentary briefing](https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PN-0568) on 

 Science Diplomacy and participated in the POST annual reception on the same topic in January 2019.  “ *Our office had not looked at science diplomacy before, and we are grateful for your input at the research stage, and your comments on the draft that was sent for external peer review were particularly useful to us when we were making the final editorial changes*” \( **E 8,** Dr Grant Hill\-Cathorne 11 October 2018\) This directly led to knowledge exchange activities including the American Geophysical Union  [requesting a blog about how Arctic geopolitics informs policymaking](https://blogs.agu.org/onthejob/2019/03/07/putting-arctic-geopolitics-to-work/). This was the first time the AGU published a piece on polar geopolitics. He also contributes to POST and RUSI polar events and spoke at the House of Commons Antarctic Parliamentarians Conference \(2019, c. 200 in attendance\). 

1.  <ins> **Informing Public Understanding of the Polar Regions**</ins> 

 Dodds’ research conducted on the Arctic and Antarctic has contributed to the reformation of UK policy conversations about polar geopolitics \(R1, R2, R6\). Historically, public discourse on the polar regions have favoured exploration, heritage and science. The underpinning research has informed an explicitly geopolitical hue, showing that scrambles for knowledge, influence and strategic advantage matter. 

 <ins>Working with specialist polar science agencies</ins> 

 Research conducted by Dodds on Antarctic geopolitics and governance informs how the UK’s main public polar stakeholder, BAS, makes sense of its strategic role. In 2015, the website of BAS re\-wrote its description of the Antarctic Treaty to  [account for geopolitical factors](https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/antarctica/the-antarctic-treaty/the-antarctic-treaty-explained/). Dodds’ research expertise paved the way to formal recognition that the social sciences have an important role in complementing natural sciences as sources of advice to UK polar policy, in 2019 Dodds became first social scientist to be appointed an Honorary Fellow of BAS in recognition of this impactful work. \[text removed for publication\]  \( **E 5**, \[text removed for publication\] 11th April 2019\). 

 <ins>Informing Exhibitions, Museum Curators and Public Audiences</ins> 

 Dodds’ research on polar geopolitics has informed major exhibitions, inspired curators and visitors.  He served as expert adviser to the British Library *Lines in the Ice exhibition* \(2014\), and to the Polar Worlds gallery of the Royal Museums Greenwich \(2018\). Dodds’ expertise was cited as major factors in their planning and curation; both exhibitions and the accompanying books *Lines in the Ice* \(British Library Publishing 2016\) used Dodds’ research findings on the contested geopolitics of the Arctic and Antarctic. The British Library’s exhibition received approximately 114,000 visitors– the second highest British Library exhibition attendance figure: “ *Using Klaus’s support and expertise the exhibition communicated ideas about the complex history and modern geography of the Arctic to visitors*”. \( **E 3,** Philip Hatfield 31<sup>st</sup> January 2017\). \[text removed for publication\] of the Polar Worlds gallery at the Royal Museums Greenwich commented: \[text removed for publication\] \( **E 4,** \[text removed for publication\] 23 November 2018\). 

 In addition to these major exhibitions, Dodds regularly advises galleries, libraries, learned societies and museums about polar geopolitics, including speaking at public events at the National History Museum, the Science Museum, Royal Institution, Dulwich Picture Gallery, RGS, British Library, British Science Association, and National Maritime Museum. Between August 2013 and December 2020, he delivered 18 public lectures, chaired three British Library panel discussion, with average audiences of 250 to 300 people. The British Library staff \(including Dr Hatfield and Jon Fawcett, Head of Events\) sent emails to Dodds confirming very positive feedback from the audiences. 

 <ins>Working with Media</ins> 

 Regular media writing and public broadcasting has enabled Dodds’ research on polar geopolitics to reach wider audiences. On 4<sup>th</sup> February 2015, the *Washington Post* \(circulation c. 250,000\) published a piece ‘What Antarctica teaches me about politics’ and referenced an output of Dodds as recommendation: “ *In preparation for this trip. I read Klaus Dodds’s primer “* [*Antarctica: A Very Short Introduction”*](http://www.amazon.com/Antarctic-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions-ebook/dp/B00BP6U5EO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1423048290&sr=1-1&keywords=Klaus+Dodds%E2%80%99+Antarctica%3A+A+Short+Introduction). In January 2019, Dodds appeared on BBC World Service’s ‘The Forum on North Pole’ \(aired 29 January, 41 minutes, 1.3 million total listeners for BBC World Service per week\). On 21 August 2019 *Financial Times* referenced Dodds three times on a story about Trump and Greenland \( *Financial Times*, circulation c. 105,000\). Dodds was referenced four times for a BBC Future piece on ‘The rush to claim an undersea mountain range’ \(BBC Future 23<sup>rd</sup> July 2020, BBC describes ‘BBC Future’ as having one million fans on Facebook\). 

 Between 2014 and 2020, Dodds has written a monthly column for the *Geographical Magazine*. As the \[text removed for publication\] noted \[text removed for publication\] \( **E 10,** \[text removed for publication\] 13<sup>th</sup> November 2019\). He contributed to multiple podcasts such as Polar Geopolitics \(2019\), UK Antarctic Heritage Trust \(2020\) and John Hopkins Podcast on Foreign Affairs \(2020\). His 2019 invited google talk on geopolitics was watched over 25,000 times. 

1.  <ins> **Informing Education on the Polar Regions**</ins> 

 Dodds was appointed to the A Level Advisory Content Board \(ALCAB\) in 2014 to advise on polar geopolitics and the governance of the global commons \(which includes the oceans\). His research changed the A Level Geography syllabus from 2016 by including developing new teaching materials for the global commons. In response to that change, he produced a briefing note for the Royal Geographical Society\-IBG which won a highly Commended award from the Geographical Association in 2016. 

 The education company AQA, which has about 45% of all entries for A level \(approximately 12,000 candidates in 2020\) recommends that briefing in their Global Systems and Global Governance  [scheme of work](https://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/geography/specifications/AQA-7037-SP-2016.PDF). Multiple invitations to lectures and publishing in the teaching\-led journals, such as *Teaching* G *eography* \(distribution of 2,600 schools/colleges\) and *Geography Review* \(c. 10,000 subscribers\) gives further evidence of beneficiaries. These lectures and papers have specifically targeted teachers worried about developing case studies for this compulsory element of the A Level curriculum. Since 2015, 14 lectures to CPD events organized by the Prince’s Teaching Institute and GA\-sponsored events have been delivered, with audiences ranging from 20 to 100 teachers. The author was asked to participate in CPD days for the Geographical Association \(2014 to 2020, group sizes from 15 to 40\). 

 His *Geopolitics: A Very Short Introduction* \(three editions\) has sold approximately 35,000 copies and translated into 10 languages. It is read by both university and school students and public readerships around the world.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Professor Crawford’s research into policing partnerships informed the design, establishment and implementation of a large\-scale, innovative and sustainable police\-academic research partnership – the N8 Policing Research Partnership \(N8PRP\) – that has transformed organisational learning. This transformation has changed how police forces and partners in the North of England organise and use research evidence, generate and share knowledge and value research\-informed policing practice. The N8PRP operationalises and builds on Crawford's conceptualisation and methodologies of research co\-production and partnership\-working. Implementation of the Partnership has enhanced the application of research leading to changes in frontline policing. It has also influenced the development of evidence\-based policing and mechanisms underpinning effective police\-academic partnerships more broadly across the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The use of research evidence in policing lags considerably behind other public services, such as healthcare, medicine and social care. Yet robust research knowledge can play a vital role in underpinning police legitimacy and the delivery of effective policing strategies and frontline practices. With radically different conceptions of what constitutes evidence, academic researchers and the police are influenced by contrasting demands and interests, and driven by distinct values and motivations, undermining the application of research evidence in policing. In 2012, the Home Office  [*Review of Police Leadership and Training*](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118222/report.pdf) identified the need for a fundamental ‘transformation of the culture of learning in the police service’ to translate research evidence into policing. Organisational learning from research across the 43 separate police forces in England and Wales has been piecemeal, fragmented and poorly coordinated. 

 Through his career\-spanning research, Crawford has identified barriers to constructive policing partnerships **\[1\-3\]** and developed a model of how the co\-production of research could be applied to policing and translate into policing practices **\[4,5\]**. It is explicitly based on the philosophy that those who use research and apply the knowledge base should be involved in building it by actively co\-producing the evidence **\[4\-6\]**. Crawford’s research findings and philosophy were translated, applied and adapted to policing through a series of research grants **\[a\-d\]** and resulted in designing, establishing and implementing the N8PRP in 2013. This provided a platform for collaboration between the eight research\-intensive universities that comprise the  [N8](https://www.n8research.org.uk/), 11 Police and Crime Commissioners \(PCCs\), 11 police forces and other community safety partners across the North of England. The N8PRP is the largest and most ambitious police\-academic research partnership in the UK and possibly across the globe. 

 Crawford’s methodologies of co\-production were piloted, tested and refined through an ESRC Knowledge Exchange Grant **\[a\]** with West Yorkshire Police and the Office of the PCC. Empirically, this project also provided a detailed analysis of policing partnerships working in the context of safeguarding children **\[3\]**. A College of Policing Grant **\[b\]** enabled Crawford to build research capacity among the N8 universities and engage policing partners across the North of England. A HEFCE Catalyst Grant **\[c\]** provided funding for an ambitious five\-year programme \(2015\-20\) of research and knowledge exchange to implement Crawford’s model of co\-production through the N8PRP’s police\-academic collaborative platforms and engagement mechanisms. In 2019, Crawford secured commitments from all N8PRP partners to a jointly funded, co\-governed model that will sustain the Partnership beyond the end of the Catalyst Grant through pooled investments **\[d\]**. This further embedded the co\-production philosophy, as informed by Crawford’s critical reflection on partnership implementation **\[4\-6\]**. 

 **Findings** 

 Crawford’s research identified barriers to effective policing partnerships **\[1\]** including: agencies’ conflicting interests, priorities, and cultural assumptions; poor conflict management processes; inappropriate governance and managerial structures; lack of trust between organisations; a desire to protect budgets; lack of capacity and expertise; technological and cultural barriers to sharing data; and over\-reliance on informal contacts which lapsed if key individuals moved on. Successful policing partnerships require meaningful, enduring, open and trusting relationships across agency boundaries **\[1\-3\]**. Crawford has piloted and developed co\-production as both a means and an end to effecting organisational change. The model involves police and academics co\-producing and sharing knowledge, with supporting structures and an ethos to support durable, mutually beneficial partnerships at multiple levels of the organisations **\[a\]** to ensure change is anchored within cultures **\[4,5\]**. 

 The N8PRP’s governance and process structures create a distinctive model for co\-production, cognisant of the barriers to policing partnerships **\[1\-3\]** and based on the following findings: 

-  A reformed conception of what constitutes knowledge – as socially\-distributed, transdisciplinary, action\-oriented and subject to multiple accountabilities – as well as how frontline practitioners can co\-create, mobilise and use knowledge **\[5,6\]**. 

-  A normative concern to translate and apply the knowledge base focused around public outcomes and benefits **\[4,5\]**. 

-  Benefits derive from frontline police staff and academics working together using different perspectives to jointly frame and shape questions, methodologies and impacts **\[4,5\]**. 

-  Change is rooted in, and occurs through, relationships and processes; it can be non\-linear and have many causes **\[5,6\]**. 

-  Impacts arise from processes of mutual learning, often involving a gradual series of changes undertaken collaboratively **\[6\]**.

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Crawford’s research and its implementation through the N8PRP have \(i\) transformed how police forces in the North of England organise and derive benefits from research and engage with academic researchers, and \(ii\) enriched the perception, value and use of research\-informed practice across policing organisations in the UK. Direct beneficiaries of the impacts include police and partners, with indirect benefits to service users and communities. 

 **\(i\) Transforming organisational learning and engagement with research/researchers** 

 The N8PRP’s infrastructure, operating principles and activities have positively transformed police\-academic relations, improved the quality of inter\-professional dialogue and enhanced the value of, and access to, research within policing. Key to this transformation in organisational learning have been the collaborative governance framework and new platforms for engagement, which have mitigated common barriers to policing partnerships identified by Crawford **\[1,2\]** and allowed the partners to reach collective decisions on priorities, investments and co\-designed research projects to be awarded funding. Partners are represented on the decision\-making N8PRP Steering Group, which includes College of Policing representation to ensure national learning and engagement. 

 A further operating principle of partnership governance has been the sharing of co\-produced research across the partners, the benefits of which was corroborated by the Strategy Manager at West Yorkshire Police: *‘As all police forces strive to be more evidence\-based, to be more innovative and to implement good practice/what works, the N8 structure allows those conversations to take place, with different perspectives between policing and academia shared. The infrastructure also allows for academia and police professionals to share research findings more widely with other forces so that there is a cumulative benefit’* **\[A\]**. This helped embed an evidence\-based approach to the police force’s strategic planning process **\[A\]**. 

 As a result of the Partnership, police have reorganised and adapted how they engage with the production and application of research. Informed by Crawford’s research on effective partnerships **\[1,3\]**, new platforms for engagement have included: annual policing innovation forums focused on collectively agreed priorities; data mobilisation events at which police identify under\-utilised datasets; and the  [Register of Experts](https://n8prp.org.uk/experts/), providing accessible means of connecting researchers and practitioners to build inter\-organisational research capability and enable knowledge exchange. Innovation forums have highlighted knowledge gaps and opportunities for practice\-based innovation \(some have been supported by N8PRP small grants – see below\). The PCC for Durham evidenced the benefits: *‘Through events, such as the Policing Innovation Forum and the N8PRP’s register of experts, Durham Constabulary has gained a means of accessing research expertise on a plethora of subjects’* **\[B\]**. 

 The Strategy Manager at West Yorkshire Police attested that these platforms create conducive environments for police *‘to mix with academics, partners and fellow practitioners in order to share ideas, good practice and to discuss potential research requirements’* **\[A\]**. Consequently, the Chief Constable of Merseyside confirmed that the Partnership has ‘ *helped to foster police innovations through research, enabled collaborations, provided skills training for analysts and fostered organisational learning across policing*’ **\[C\]**. As a result of this new infrastructure, police forces have changed how they engage with and commission research and use research evidence **\[B,C\]**. West Yorkshire Police cited the N8PRP as a key element in helping embed an evidence\-based approach into their strategic planning process and providing *‘a greater understanding of the scale and nature of our crime and demand threats*’ **\[A\]**. 

 Consequently, evidence is now used more strategically and policing organisations share learning across force areas in new and more effective ways. The former Head of West Yorkshire for Innovation \(based in the PCC’s Office\) confirmed: *‘the framework of the N8PRP has, for the very first time, brought the twelve police forces of the north together where they are now sharing effective practices, discussing operational challenges and identifying common research requirements to better protect the communities they serve’* **\[D\]**. 

 An *Independent Review* of the N8PRP – based on a survey of over 150 officers from participating forces and interviews with 20 senior police officers and PCCs within the participating forces, plus national policing leaders **\[E\]** – found that: awareness of the partnership is high amongst senior staff; establishing the organisational infrastructure for the N8PRP was seen as a significant achievement; and those who used N8PRP ‘products’, such as research reports, conferences and courses, valued them. One interviewee concluded: *‘It* \[N8PRP\] *is a really impressive product… I think the infrastructure that was laid was probably as impressive as I’ve ever seen’* **\[E\]** \[Interviewee 05, p. 13\]. Another stated: *‘The N8 is an example of genuine co\-production…* \[it\] *is probably the best example of a major funding programme to particularly facilitate the relationship between academics and the police... I think the police attitude to research has changed dramatically’* **\[E\]** \[Interviewee 06, p. iv\]. 

 Central to the Partnership’s working has been how Crawford’s research co\-production philosophy **\[4,5,6\]** and practice have fostered organisational change, as highlighted by the Strategy Manager at West Yorkshire Police: *‘co\-produced research is a critical part of us achieving our ambition to be a more innovative and evidence\-based organisation. The co\-produced element is a fundamental principle as it enables the blend of academic rigour with practical policing knowledge. Fundamentally, it allows police professionals to be involved from the onset, to influence the design and content and to ensure that the research is undertaken in a timely manner and most importantly can have practical application’* **\[A\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Enriching the perception, value and use of research\-informed practice in the UK** 

 The Partnership has: raised the profile, understanding and value of research evidence in informing policing; engaged frontline practitioners and managers in creating knowledge, using data and applying research to policing practice; and fostered ‘ *greater recognition and understanding of the importance of policing research*’ **\[F\]**. Police forces have directly gained new knowledge from the Partnership’s activities, including the training programme, innovation forums and the ‘Empowering Data Specialists in Policing’ continuing professional development \(CPD\) programme. Data resources have been put to new uses through data mobilisation events and processes, developed as a direct response to the research finding that data exchange was a key barrier **\[1\]**. 

 In line with the Partnership’s philosophy, the CPD programme was co\-produced and co\-designed by academics and practitioners in the N8PRP **\[G\]**. Across the three cohorts, it has received considerable praise for its knowledge and skills development from participants and \(international\) observers. The *Independent Review* found that the CPD course for data analysts was especially valued, ‘ *with large majorities of participants saying that it had* *improved their understanding of the issues and their knowledge of the evidence base*’ **\[E\]**. 

 Former Lancashire Police Data Analysis and Insight Manager confirmed: ‘ *Perhaps for the first time for many of the participants, police analysts have been exposed to a series of modules that expanded their knowledge and tested their existing skill sets’* **\[G\]**. In recognition of its pioneering contribution, the lead facilitators Fiona McLaughlin \(Leeds\) and Dr Jude Towers \(Lancaster\) were recipients of the 2020  [‘Excellence in Analysis’ Award](https://www.ialeia.org/awards.php) from the International Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts \(IALEIA\). Data analysts have become more active and vocal champions of evidence\-based policing within their organisations **\[G\]**. 

 The Partnership’s small grants programme has helped translate co\-produced research outputs into practice with benefits to end\-users **\[H\]**. This scheme has resourced and sponsored cutting\-edge co\-designed research by inter\-professional teams with a strong focus on application. The College of Policing’s Director of Knowledge & Innovation attested: *‘The small grants programme has offered perhaps the most tangible examples of how research outputs can be translated into impact on policing practice, supporting police\-academic co\-produced research projects on various policing priority areas’* **\[I\]**. The corroboration cites the example of ‘Policing Bitcoin’ \(PI David Wall, Leeds\), which brought together police and academic experts to explore the novel challenges posed by criminal use of bitcoin: *‘The project… helped facilitate practical application of the research findings by translating these into the design and delivery of national training to UK law enforcement leads and other key stakeholders’* **\[I\].** In another example, the Partnership was *‘instrumental’* to impacts derived from the ‘Coercive Control’ project \(PI Charlotte Barlow, Lancaster\) with Merseyside Police, as evidenced by the Chief Constable **\[C\]**. Through such projects, learning has been spread across forces, resulting in benefits from specific research that has made *‘an impact on how forces do business’* **\[J\]** and *‘helped to fill evidence gaps’* **\[H\]**. These have produced benefits to policing and communities. 

 The N8PRP is recognised far beyond its geographical base in the North of England for producing insight and learning. The contribution of Crawford’s research to national policing via the N8PRP was corroborated by the national College of Policing: *‘His critical reflection on his experience of leading N8PRP has provided valuable learning and insight on the key mechanisms and approaches underpinning effective partnership working. Co\-production between police and academics defines the philosophy and strategy of N8PRP, recognising the importance of joint working between partners in bringing about positive change in police culture and practice… N8PRP has made a valuable contribution to the evidence base on effective co\-production… We have been able to draw on this work to inform the support we provide to police\-academic research collaborations across the UK’* **\[I\]**. Crawford’s research consequently ‘ *fed into*’ the College’s ‘ *strategies for embedding evidence\-based practices*’ **\[I\]**.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 DeVore’s research contributes to critical debates on how modern democracies can best provide for their security. The accelerating pace of technological innovation poses deep challenges to both military organizations and domestic defense industries. While the former struggle to recognize and reform obsolete capabilities, the latter face nearly insurmountable economic obstacles to producing cutting edge weapons by themselves. DeVore’s research findings shed new light on why military organizations so often resist change, focusing on the deficiencies of modern airborne forces. His findings also illuminate how states can navigate international armament collaborations to both maintain the autonomy of their domestic defense industries while pooling resources with select partners to stay at the cutting edge of technological development. 

1.  <ins>Why militaries resist change: Airborne Forces</ins> 

 Scholars have long noted that technological innovations and societal developments render older capabilities obsolete. To remain competitive, military institutions must adapt and change. Yet all too often, they fail to do so. DeVore’s research analyzes *why* militaries continue to invest resources and personnel in obsolete weapons, units, and operational concepts that no longer enhance battlefield performance. The answer centers on organizational autonomy. Militaries often establish independent services, branches, or units to explore new technologies and doctrines. While initially beneficial, these sub\-units become powerful actors that later defend their weapons and practices against future innovation, leading to wasted resources. 

 Devore’s monograph, *When Failure Thrives*, demonstrates these dynamics with respect to paratroop formations in the US, UK, and Soviet Union **\[R1\]**. By the 1970s, improvements to air defenses combined with the global proliferation of tanks rendered large\-scale airborne operations all but suicidal. Yet these militaries continued to pour resources into large paratroop units, in counterproductive ways, precisely because those units had the power and autonomy to resist change. In the US case, this led to problematic deficiencies: airborne forces remained organized into overly large units, were extremely vulnerable to artillery, and lacked proper mobility and firepower once on the ground. 

1.  <ins>Balancing domestic arms production with international collaboration</ins> 

 Governments also struggle to navigate the rapid pace of contemporary technological change and its implications for defense spending and procurement. Only great military and economic powers like the U.S. and China have the resources to independently stay at the cutting edge of military technology. Prior research suggested that all other governments must choose between producing outdated weapons domestically or becoming subcontractors within large international collaborations. 

 DeVore’s research argues that this is a false and dangerous dichotomy. The increasing complexity of weapons has made self\-sufficiency in arms production unattainable \(perhaps even economically ruinous\) for most states, making international collaboration necessary **\[R2\]**. Yet, giving up independent domestic defense industries would also be catastrophic for military performance. These industries possess skills and experience that allow militaries to adapt their weapons to changing battlefield conditions and unanticipated threats **\[R3\]**. 

 Governments must thus strike a balance between domestic arms production and international collaborations to avoid the downsides of doing either alone **\[R4, R6\]**. How they strike this balance is a fraught process without a one\-size\-fits all solution. Indeed, the states that fare best match their strategies to both their existing economic institutions and the necessities of the particular weapons programme being developed. For example, where research and development costs are high and production requires large economies of scale, governments should seek out international partners. However, they should ensure that their partners share similar firm/state relations to facilitate useful cooperation **\[R4, R5\]**. Governments should also choose collaborations that protect the existing strengths and comparative advantages of their domestic defense industries **\[R2\]**.

Specifically, DeVore’s research on how the accelerating pace of technological innovation poses deep challenges to both military organizations and domestic defense industries has:</ins> 

  -  <ins>Provoked an intense debate over the vulnerabilities and deficiencies of U.S. airborne forces, leading to</ins> <ins>reform initiatives to improve their mobility and firepower.

These changes have g</ins><ins>reatly ameliorated the risks of unexpected cost escalations while enhancing the likelihood of</ins> <ins>producing a functional combat aircraft that is globally price competitive</ins><ins>.</ins> 

1.  <ins>Reforming U.S. Airborne Forces</ins> 

 DeVore’s research findings on the vulnerabilities and deficiencies of U.S. Airborne Forces, stemming from their organizational resistance to change, sparked an intense debate within the U.S. Army which ultimately led to concrete reforms—improving the mobility and firepower of paratroop units. The *Army Times*, widely subscribed to and read by army personnel, published an extended exposé and in\-print debate on the future of U.S. airborne forces, based on the findings of *When Failure Thrives* **\[R1\]**, with several leading decision\-makers within the army agreeing with DeVore’s findings, including a retired Colonel, retired General, and a senior analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments **\[S1, p.3\-4, 9\]**. The Army Press deputy director notes that DeVore’s study “ *stirred considerable controversy within the U.S. Army. Staff researchers for the U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee contacted me to ask further questions about the monograph which they had used to deepen their understanding of Army capabilities and prepare their members for policy discussions… Even those advocates of Airborne forces who disagreed with DeVore’s message took away from his work the key insight that paratroopers must proactively work to reform themselves*” **\[S2\]**. 

 These debates then catalysed a reassessment of U.S. airborne forces and proposals for their reform and modernization. For example, analysts with RAND \(an important U.S. defence think tank\), cited DeVore’s findings on the unrealistically large size of airborne units, their extreme vulnerability to enemy fire, and their lack of ground mobility \(i.e. vehicles\) **\[S3, p.1\-2, 7\]**. They then proposed re\-envisioning the role of airborne forces around small\-scale missions such as combatting terrorism and evacuating foreign nationals during emergencies, while also equipping paratrooper units with armoured vehicles and light armour **\[S3, p.4\-5, 7\-8\]**. Similarly, the *Military Review* published a proposal that would overcome these same deficiencies by reorganizing airborne assault capabilities around small reconnaissance squadrons equipped with light armoured vehicles **\[S4, p.93\-94\]**. 

 The U.S. Army ultimately embraced some of these proposed reforms, congruent with DeVore’s research findings that airborne forces lacked adequate firepower and mobility, while being overly vulnerable to artillery **\[R1\]**. “ *The Army has, in the years since the publication of DeVore’s monograph, sought to rectify airborne forces’ shortcomings. Perhaps most impressive has been the Army’s efforts to address the lack of tank and anti\-tank capabilities that DeVore had criticized*.” **\[S2\]** In 2018, the Army created a light armoured company within the 82nd Airborne Division, equipped with parachutable wheeled armoured vehicles—an investment of over USD26,000,000 in vehicle procurement alone **\[S5\]**. As the Director of the US Army Combat Studies Institute attests, *“recent developments in the force structure of the US Army’s airborne forces indicate that thinking officers took some of \[DeVore’s\] arguments to heart… two of the US Army’s five airborne brigades incorporated ‘Stryker’ light armored vehicles to their organic arsenals. The Stryker… will add a completely new dimension of protection to airborne forces, mitigating the historically vulnerable infantry forces’ greatest weakness”* **\[S6\]**. In 2019, the Army then embarked on a project to develop airborne tanks to provide even greater firepower and mobility to its airborne units **\[S5\]**. *“The US Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command continues to refine its search for a light\-weight air\-droppable tank to accompany parachute forces on a forced\-entry mission”* **\[S6\]**. These initiatives represent the first time that U.S. airborne forces would have armoured vehicle capabilities since the 1990s, when the last of their tanks were retired from service, and the first new research and development on airborne tanks since the 1960s. 

1.  <ins>Shaping Technology Acquisition in South Korea’s Air Force</ins> 

 <ins>DeVore’s research findings on balancing domestic arms production with international collaborations—particularly leveraging global partnerships to overcome high research and development costs and create economies of scale while cultivating domestic production strengths</ins> <ins> **\[R2, R4</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>R6\]**</ins><ins>—has shaped how South Korea’s government has pursued its K\-FX fighter jet</ins> <ins>programme</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Combat aircraft are one of the most sophisticated weapons systems to produce, with many expensive and technologically advanced sub\-component systems that are difficult for states to develop comprehensively on their own.</ins> <ins>H</ins><ins>istorically, over 75% of combat aircraft development initiatives have failed to produce a functional aircraft that is globally price competitive</ins><ins>. Only six successful</ins> <ins>programmes</ins> <ins>currently exist</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Despite these odds, the South Korean Air Force initially launched its estimated</ins> <ins>USD</ins><ins>16</ins><ins>,000,000,000</ins> <ins>fighter jet</ins> <ins>programme</ins><ins>—the largest armaments project ever undertaken in South Korea—with</ins> <ins>high ambitions for self\-sufficiency and only one partner, Indonesia.</ins> 

 <ins>DeVore was initially invited to share his research during the 2015 National Air Power Conference by two concerned Korean academics, who in 2017 became the National Security Advisor and Vice\-Foreign Minister to the newly elected Korean government. This launched a period of sustained engagement where DeVore routinely participated in dialogues with Korean policymakers and Air Force officers on the difficulties of developing an indigenous fighter jet</ins> <ins>programme</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>including three additional National Air Power Conferences and seminars/workshops with government funded think tanks such as the Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, the Sejong Institute, the Institute for National Security Studies, and the East Asia Foundation</ins> <ins> **\[S</ins><ins>7</ins><ins>, S</ins><ins>8</ins><ins>\]**</ins><ins>. DeVore was further granted a consulting contract on aerospace development with South Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, beginning in 2016 and still ongoing</ins> <ins> **\[S</ins><ins>9</ins><ins>\]**</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 <ins>Through these engagements, DeVore’s research findings reshaped the KF\-X fighter project in</ins> <ins>key ways</ins><ins>. Consistent with the importance</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>shar</ins><ins>ing</ins> <ins>costs and creat</ins><ins>ing</ins> <ins>economies of scale</ins> <ins> **\[R4, R5\]**</ins><ins>, Korea has begun actively pursuing many more global partnerships, either as full co\-developers or to provide difficult sub\-components.</ins> <ins>As the</ins> <ins>Project Head for Korea’s Aerospace Technology Transfer Programme at South Korea’s Agency for Defense Development</ins> <ins>attests, “</ins> *Devore's research on leveraging global partnerships to overcome high research and development costs emphasized to us the importance of expanding our set of partners and obtaining high cost sub\-systems from them*” **\[S10\]**. The <ins>South Korean National Security Advisor elaborates that, “</ins> *Our government has thus gone to great lengths to preserve its co\-development partnership with Indonesia when that later country’s financial problems led it to question whether to continue the project.  We have also sought new partners, unsuccessfully negotiating a co\-development partnership with Turkey and more successfully seeking focused technological arrangements with Israel and India*” **\[S11\]**. <ins>At the same time, to protect existing strengths and comparative advantages</ins> <ins> **\[R2\]**</ins><ins>, Korea will focus on domestically developing important aspects of the flight control software and electronic systems. Indeed, the agreement with Israel also provides for technology transfer so that Korea can eventually develop their own expertise in aerospace radar</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>According to the First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, “</ins><ins> *Dr. DeVore’s emphasis on the need for an activist state to overcome technological bottlenecks encouraged our Agency for Defense Development to proactively ‘target’ key technologies for either domestic development or acquisition through international partnerships*</ins><ins>”</ins> <ins> **\[S12\]**</ins><ins>. The</ins> <ins>Project Head for Korea’s Aerospace Technology Transfer Programme</ins> <ins>further</ins> <ins>attests</ins> <ins>that</ins> <ins>“</ins> *these changes*— *more international partnerships, globalizing our supply chain, and seeking out technology transfers*— *are mitigating the risks of unexpected cost escalations and increasing the likelihood of the project becoming a success*” **\[S10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Marina Frolova\-Walker’s career\-long research and public engagement in the area of Russian music, particularly while working at the University of Cambridge, have made her the indispensable voice of Russian music for UK and, increasingly, international audiences. Through public engagement via BBC appearances, participation in the Bard Festival \(New York\), public lectures, pre\-concert talks and publications for general audiences in the UK, US, Russia, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, Frolova\-Walker has deepened understanding of Russian music, debunking stereotypes, introducing audiences to unknown composers, and demystifying the repertoire. Frolova\-Walker’s research has also directly benefitted practitioners, including radio producers and presenters \(particularly at the BBC\), festival organisers and arts organisations, whose programming she has guided. Her research has also had an impact on professional creative practice, influencing the interpretation and creation of musical works, including the award\-winning soundtrack to *The* *Death of Stalin* \(2017\).

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since her move to Cambridge in 2000, Frolova\-Walker has reinterpreted the history of Russian music and musical life from around 1840 to the post\-Soviet era. This long time\-span was previously characterised by exotic fables and myth\-making about what counted as ‘Russian’ music in the nineteenth century. Soviet composers were reduced to a select few, with Shostakovich and Prokofiev eclipsing all others. Post\-Soviet histories of Soviet music also created heroes and villains among composers negotiating a power structure in which Stalin’s personal decisions seemed decisive. Through extensive archival research, Frolova\-Walker debunked many of these fictions, exposing the wishful thinking behind them. In the process, she has also devoted more clear\-eyed attention than many musicologists to the workings of musical life and the making of musical reputations. Her work highlights the importance of understanding the backstage collaborations and disputes that lie behind famous works and composers. She examines the often banal decision\-making that can reduce worthy composers to an obscurity from which her work is rescuing them—not as heroes, but as cultural figures we need to understand alongside the household names. 

 Frolova\-Walker’s primary research outputs comprise two monographs **\[R1, R2\],** one co\-authored book **\[R3\]**, a solo\-edited volume **\[R4\]** and a co\-edited volume **\[R5\]**, in addition to over 20 book chapters and articles **\[including R6\]**. 

 In *Russian Music and Nationalism from Glinka to Stalin* \(Yale, 2007\) **\[R1\]**, Frolova\-Walker exposed as a convenient national fiction the exotic and folk\-like character of ‘true’ Russian music. She showed how this notion suited narratives of Russian musical emancipation in the nineteenth century, underpinned the export of an exotic Russianness to the west by Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes, and aided Soviet control of regional identity. 

 In *Music and Soviet Power, 1917\-1932* \(Boydell and Brewer, 2014\) **\[R3\]**, Frolova\-Walker analysed key Soviet sources hitherto unavailable in the West, contextualising them into a new history illustrating the aesthetic complexity of the pre\-Stalin years. 

 Her subsequent monograph, *Stalin’s Music Prize* \(Yale, 2016\) **\[R2\]**, and complementary article on Shostakovich **\[R6\]**, analysed the complex relationship of composers and their music to an authoritarian state. The book challenged the idea that the coveted Stalin Prize meant that any rewarded composer was a personal ‘favourite’. It showed the pragmatic messiness of backroom decision\-making by musicians who both implemented and created state policy, and uncovered the work of over 100 composers and over 200 performers only a fraction of whom were known to music\-lovers in the West. 

 In *Russian Music since 1917* \(OUP, 2017\) **\[R5\]**, co\-edited with Patrick Zuk, and published to coincide with the centenary of the Russian Revolution, Frolova\-Walker’s own chapter reappraised the liberating and myth\-destroying effects of *glasnost* on Russian musicology, contrasted with more recent imperatives of intellectual self\-censorship under Putin. As a whole, the book destabilised ‘common knowledge’: it revealed how Russian and Western scholars of different generations had created wildly divergent histories of the same music, or different hierarchies of composers, as a result of their scholarly and political experience. 

 Frolova\-Walker’s most recent edited collection, *Rimsky\-Korsakov and his World* \(Princeton, 2018\) **\[R4\]**, was published as an integral part of the Bard Festival, as a handbook for the public attending. Building on *Russian Music and Nationalism*, it illustrated how folk\-based Russian music depended on compromise and cliché, and spotlighted the conflicted and vulnerable poacher\-turned\-gamekeeper role of Rimsky\-Korsakov, who morphed from amateur mentor of ‘true Russian’ folklorists to professional conservatoire teacher. 

 Frolova\-Walker’s research is pervaded by an explicit appreciation of how expediently music history is made, undone, and made again. It is crafted to make readers think anew about the human cost of music\-making and to look beneath and behind shiny stories of national heroism, dissidence and genius. Widely applauded by academic reviewers of her research, this demystification and humanising of music history characterises both her public engagement activity and the direct impact of her research on creative practitioners.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Public Engagement and Cultural Impact** 

 **\(i\) Raising awareness of Russian music through the BBC** 

 Frolova\-Walker has benefitted UK music\-loving radio and TV audiences, significantly raising awareness of lesser\-known composers from the Soviet era and offering new perspectives on Russian music. As one broadcaster writes, Frolova\-Walker plays ‘a central role in the UK today in opening the world of classical music – and especially Russian and Soviet music – to those who might otherwise have had only limited chances to encounter it’ **\[E1 p.4\]**. A key pathway to this impact has been Frolova\-Walker’s extensive public broadcasting work, particularly for the BBC: according to one BBC Radio 3 producer, Frolova\-Walker ‘has long been the “go to” Russian/Soviet music expert for Radio 3’, as a ‘peerless … expert commentator’ on this repertoire **\[E2\]**. The reach of her research within the UK is evidenced through this relationship with BBC programme makers. Since August 2013 she has made 29 contributions to BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, the World Service, and BBC Four, including five Proms Extra events, and five conversations about record releases for BBC Radio 3’s *Record Review*. She has also written and presented six editions of *Record Review’s* *Building a Library*, one of which was the first ‘favourite’ from the archives to be rebroadcast at the start of the Lockdown in March 2020 \(average live audience figures 143,000; available indefinitely as a podcast\) **\[E3\]**. One BBC Radio 3 producer notes the significance of Frolova\-Walker’s research and approach to this area of scholarship, observing that she ‘never comes to predictable conclusions or holds a fixed dogmatic view and so she is especially valuable to us and our audience’ **\[E2\]**. This is confirmed by listeners to BBC Radio 3 *Record Review*, who have thanked Frolova\-Walker ‘for pointing me in a new direction’ **\[E4 p.3\]**; for ‘sensitive, intelligent, deeply perceptive criticism that enhances enjoyment of the music\!’ **\[E4 p.5\]**, and for enlarging their ‘appreciation & understanding’ of the works under review **\[E4 p.6\]**. Her listening recommendations have also provided economic impact by influencing consumer purchases: ‘I bought these renditions of Rachmaninov’s four concertos after Marina Frolova\-Walker rated \[them\] as the best of those currently available … Marina has steered me in the direction of some excellent pieces and performances over the years’ \( *Amazon review*\) **\[E4 p.7\]**. 

 In November 2017, Frolova\-Walker was the guest specialist in a double\-length edition of *Composer of the Week* on Soviet Composers \( *Soviet Russia, 1917\-1953*\), for which she was interviewed daily \(average live audience figures 110,000; one month on iPlayer\) **\[E3\]**. The programme’s host later tweeted: ‘she was simply brilliant: one of the best guests I’ve ever had on the programme. The perfect amalgam of erudition, specific detail, broad brush, wit and humour’ **\[E4 p.8\]**. Listeners to the programme responded enthusiastically: ‘real eyeopeners’ **\[E4, p.4\];** ‘Fascinating informative stuff. This is what the station does best’ **\[E4 p.9\]**; ‘Catching up with splendid Composer of the Week programmes … composers from Soviet Russia, well\-known and unknown, presenting a century to our ears’ **\[E4 p.10\]**. Also in 2017 Frolova\-Walker participated in, and curated, a live three\-hour feature on the centenary of the Russian Revolution, *Breaking Free: A Century of Russian Culture*, presented by Tom Service \(November 2017\). As one listener tweeted, ‘this Breaking Free season about Russia is really fantastic, so informative and imaginatively curated and presented, especially Professor Marina Frolova\-Walker’ **\[E4 p.14\]**. 

 In addition to her Radio work, Frolova\-Walker contributed to the acclaimed BBC 2 film *The Leningrad Orchestra that Defied Hitler* \(January 2016; rebroadcast February 2019, April 2020\), for which she was interviewed, and also acted as a historical consultant. As one viewer wrote: ‘Once in a while there comes along a programme of such quality, so deeply moving and respectfully made, that alone it commands an entire year’s licence fee’ **\[E4 p.13\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Scholar\-in\-residence at the 2018 Bard Music Festival** 

 The international reach of Frolova\-Walker’s public engagement was particularly emphasised when she was invited to be Scholar\-in\-Residence for the 2018 Bard College Festival at the Fisher Center for the Performing Arts \(Annandale\-on\-Hudson, New York\). Acclaimed as ‘a highlight of the musical year’ \( *Wall Street Journal*\), each Festival features a composer whose reputation is in need of re\-evaluation in light of recent scholarship: Frolova\-Walker chose Rimsky\-Korsakov. The Festival takes place across two weekends each year, bringing together two kinds of audience: ‘those with a long history of interest in concert life and first\-time listeners, who find the festival an ideal place to learn about and enjoy the riches of our musical past’ **\[E5 p.4\]**. 

 For the Festival, Frolova\-Walker curated concerts, panels and film showings, gave two talks and provided the commentary for a concert on ‘Russian Folk Music in the Mirror of Art Music’. Under Frolova\-Walker’s guidance, the entire Festival challenged the established idea of Rimsky\-Korsakov as a superficial Oriental colourist \( *New York Times*\) **\[E6 p.2\]**. It also transformed audience perception of the composer’s oeuvre: as the *Wall Street Journal* observed, Rimsky\-Korsakov’s popularity in the West ‘has essentially ridden on \[a\] mere handful of works. But what about the rest?’ **\[E6 p.7\]** Frolova\-Walker shifted public attention on to these neglected works: ‘those who remember Rimsky as simply the composer of *Flight of the Bumblebee* \(1899–1900\) or *Scheherazade* \(1888\) will be surprised to learn that, in the words of Marina Frolova\-Walker … Rimsky “staked his reputation on his operas”’ \( *New Criterion*\) **\[E6 p.10\]**. 

 Through her work for the Festival, Frolova\-Walker also led its audience to new ways of thinking about the relationship between art\-music and Russian folk\-song. The ‘Mirror of Art Music’ concert involved the Russian folk troupe Virtual Village interrupting, with dance and music, a sequence of performances of folk\-song as it occurred in art\-music settings intended for bourgeois or aristocratic audiences. The point was to imagine the discomfiture of art\-musicians being presented with the rawness of ‘real’ peasant music. For one critic: *‘*this concert achieved the lofty ambitions of the festival; it was hands down the best marriage of scholarship and performance I have witnessed. … I came away both moved and contemplating new thoughts’ \( *Hudson Review*\) **\[E6 p.17\]**. 

  

 **\(iii\) UK and international talks and publications** 

 In the UK, Frolova\-Walker’s reach has continued to increase through high\-profile public engagement appointments: first as Visiting Gresham Professor of Music \(November 2018\-May 2019\) and, since July 2019, as Gresham Professor of Music at Gresham College, London. Her cycle of four lectures on Russian Music and the State \(2018\-19\), drew 254 audience members, and has been viewed more than 8,030 times on YouTube **\[E7 pp.2\-4\]**. In 2019\-20, Frolova\-Walker’s in\-person public lectures on the Ballets Russes ‘were filled to capacity’ **\[E7 p.15\]** and have been viewed 9,492 times on YouTube **\[E7 pp.4\-6\]**. Audience members commented on the ways in which these lectures changed their perception of Russian Music: ‘greatly enhanced my listening to Russian music with a new ear’ **\[E7 p.7\]**. Others noted that the lectures introduced them to ‘more pieces and works I wasn’t familiar with or even heard of’, inspiring them to seek out ‘those \[ballets\] I haven’t yet seen and to hear more of the less\-well known music’ **\[E7 pp.12,14\]**. Additional audience feedback noted that Frolova\-Walker’s lectures ‘brought out wider connections’, shedding light on often overlooked figures and collaborations behind the scenes, leading to greater understanding of ‘how all composers, choreographers, designers worked together but also competed with each other’ **\[E7 pp.12, 9\]**. 

 Frolova\-Walker’s high\-profile public engagement activities are underpinned by public lectures and pre\-concert talks \(42 since August 2013\) and publications \(84 short essays, CD liner notes, programme notes and magazine articles since August 2013\), delivered and distributed to leading performance venues and festivals throughout the UK and beyond to Russia, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg and the US. Her books have regularly been reviewed in the mainstream media: *Stalin’s Music Prize* was featured on BBC Radio 3 *Music Matters* \(2 April 2016\), and selected as one of the Books of the Week by *The National* **\[E8 p.1\]**. An Amazon review of the same book once again praised Frolova\-Walker’s recovery of unfamiliar composers: ‘The book whets one’s appetite to search out for those recordings by little\-known composers such as Amirov, Karayev, which are mentioned through the book’s pages and other more familiar names whose works are too neglected still today’ **\[E8 p.2\]**. 

 In order to increase the accessibility of her research, Frolova\-Walker launched a website in July 2019 \(www.marinafrolova\-walker.com\), to bring together her multi\-media open access materials on one platform: users have noted that they have ‘have gained a deeper and more subtle understanding of Soviet music in a political context’ **\[E4 p.15\]**. 

 **Impact on Practitioners** 

 **\(i\) Impact on programming \(media and arts professionals\)** 

 Frolova\-Walker has regularly acted as consultant and advisor, benefitting broadcasters, producers, and arts organisations, and shaping their programming. As the co\-director of the Bard Festival explains, the desire to work with Frolova\-Walker thanks to her combination of ‘dazzling’ scholarship and ‘unmatched’ ability to communicate with non\-academic audiences, ‘was a major factor in choosing Rimsky\-Korsakov’ for the 2018 festival…This is not how we had ever worked before; we usually know what composer we want to be the focus and then try to identify the best scholar with whom to collaborate’ **\[E5 pp.1\-2\]**. 

 Since 2014, Frolova\-Walker has advised on the annual Zaubersee Festival of Russian Chamber Music in Lucerne; as the festival’s co\-founder has written, Frolova\-Walker was his ‘secret weapon’, ‘able to provide expert advice … on possible programs and repertoire that will prod and inspire the festival’s second decade’ **\[E1 p.6\]**. In May 2017, Frolova\-Walker acted as a programming consultant for the Sheffield May Festival ‘Russia in the Round’: the Artistic Director of the series commented that Frolova\-Walker’s ‘perspective on Russian music opened up any number of fascinating lines of enquiry for me that helped us to assemble a whole variety of programmes that, I would like to think, has resulted in a very comprehensive overview of Russian chamber music’ **\[E1 p.7\]**. Frolova\-Walker’s work has also had an impact on public radio programming in the USA: the creator of a 20\-episode series, *Soviet Singers*, for WMNR radio, has relied heavily on insights from her research to recreate playlists and produce historically\-informed programmes **\[E1 p.8; E4 p.15\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Impact on creative practice** 

 Frolova\-Walker’s research influenced the composition of the award\-winning original score for the 2017 film *The Death of Stalin*, directed by Armando Iannucci \(worldwide gross USD24,646,055\). Cinematic Sound Radio described the score as ‘one of the greatest film music debuts, I think, of all time’; it won the International Film Music Critics’ Association award for Best Score for a Comedy Film in 2018, and made the shortlist for nomination for the 2018 Academy Award for Best Original Score. As composer Christopher Willis explains, ‘central to the success of the score is my attempt to pastiche the sound of Soviet film and symphonic music of the 1950s, and it would be hard to overstate how much my compositional approach owed to the influence of Marina’s teaching, books and articles’ **\[E9 p.1\]**. In preparing the score, he had to study the history of the music of the time and place he was composing for; it was through Frolova\-Walker’s work, including her published articles, that Willis ‘not only educated myself on the Soviet music scene in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, but also – vitally – understood the Russian traditions reaching back into the 1800s’ **\[E9 p.2\]**. *Stalin’s Music Prize* was also important in shaping his approach to the score: ‘there are composers in there that I had never heard of. I bought lots of scores I didn’t know about’ **\[E9 p.3\]**. 

 Frolova\-Walker’s work has also benefitted performers, influencing their understanding and interpretation of Russian music. After reading *Stalin’s Music Prize*, cellist Laura van der Heijden \(winner of the 2012 BBC Young Musician of the Year competition\) asked Frolova\-Walker to be part of the project for her all\-Russian, award\-winning debut CD, *1948*. Frolova\-Walker wrote the CD liner notes and appeared in the accompanying documentary film. As van der Heijden writes, Frolova\-Walker’s ‘involvement in the project was hugely important to the development of my relationship to the works on the CD … I wanted to try to steer away from the usual stereotypes of this era presented in the West, and instead provide a nuanced representation of the many different shades of composition coexisting at the time. Reading Marina’s work gave me the opportunity to gain important \(and indeed nuanced\) contextual knowledge for my interpretations’. More than this, for van der Heijden, ‘one of the great difficulties of recording this CD was striking a balance between bringing out my own musical persona, and showing appropriate understanding of musical traditions and historical contexts. Marina’s contribution eased this process greatly, as her approach to historical information never failed to encompass and demonstrate human emotionality.’ The CD led to van der Heijden winning the 2019 BBC Classical Music Magazine Newcomer of the Year Award and the 2018 Edison Klassiek Award; she notes that ‘always central to the positive feedback the CD receives, is the thoroughness of the disc in its entirety – to which Marina’s contribution is an absolutely vital part’ **\[E10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 **Professor Zdenek Zdrahal** and **Dr Martin Hlosta’s** pioneering research in Predictive Learning Analytics has developed new tools which successfully improve higher education student retention, by providing an early warning when students are at risk of failing or abandoning their studies. These tools have reduced from 37% to 19%, the average drop\-out rate for first\-year students at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague, thus saving 422 students from abandoning their studies and preventing the faculty from losing close to GBP1 million in government funding. **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta’s** work has also improved professional practice, student outcomes and retention rates at The Open University. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Students dropping out of higher education is a critical problem for the sector, especially for distance education institutions. If universities fail to identify and support those students at risk of abandoning their studies, they risk wasting talent. As tuition fees and funding associated with student numbers are vitally important to universities, reducing drop\-out rates is also a financial imperative. Since 2011, Professor Zdenek **Zdrahal** and Dr Martin **Hlosta** have investigated how to use students’ data to discover their learning patterns and predict their likelihood of experiencing difficulties. This work on Predictive Learning Analytics offers institutions an early warning system to develop support strategies which deliver timely, effective and meaningful support to students. 

 In a 2015 article, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** explored how machine learning techniques can predict students’ success or failure **\[O1\]**. The researchers collected a sample of Open University students’ tutor\-marked assignments, weekly interactions through the virtual learning environments and their demographic information. They then used the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance algorithm to select most predictive features and generated multiple models for prediction of students’ weekly performance. Finally, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** applied the Majority Voting Algorithm to the results of this modelling to create a final forecast of expected student performance in the next assignment. Evaluation of these predictions demonstrated that the approach could identify at\-risk students early in the module. It also indicated that the predictive model’s performance increases as it collects more data. This approach to predict short\-term milestones is distinct from other proposals in the literature. In particular, it allows tutors to monitor student learning continuously and set the most appropriate short\-term goals. 

 Concurrently with this analysis of Open University student performance, the researchers explored how to transfer their proven predictive framework from distance learning to classroom\-based university education at Czech Technical University in Prague. **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** used student data from previous years to build a probabilistic model to predict, for each week, the probability of student success based on the number of credits the student earned to date. Their 2016 formal evaluation of this StudentAnalyse system confirmed its predictive ability **\[O2\]**. In particular, this research demonstrated the importance of planning interventions before the Christmas break to prevent students from dropping out in the following semesters. 

 In a 2017 article, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** tackled the problem of predicting student performance in new modules, which lack legacy data, by applying their self\-learning model to data about the students’ first submission for the module in question **\[O3\]**. In a subsequent publication the same year, the researchers improved this approach by incorporating a problem\-based sampling method, which they also generalised to enable the more detailed prediction of students’ achievement of specific learning goals within a set deadline **\[O4\]**. 

 In the 2015/2016 academic year, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** developed a pilot platform based on their research that Open University tutors could use to monitor students’ performance. Their formal evaluation of this OUAnalyse dashboard, published in 2019, evidenced that tutors’ increased use of the platform resulted in higher student pass rates **\[O5\]**. These results confirmed the value of the approach and paved the way for deployment at scale within The Open University.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** have applied solutions derived from their research **\[O1\-O5\]** on Predictive Learning Analytics in two real\-world organisational settings, to improve student retention at the Czech Technical University in Prague and The Open University. 

 **Improving student retention at the Czech Technical University** 

 In the 2015/16 academic year, the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague \(FME\-CTU\) invited the researchers to deploy the StudentAnalyse system **\[O1, O2\]** to address its historically high first\-year drop\-out rate average of 37% **\[C1\]**. After using the system to identify key student milestones and at\-risk students and applying relevant intervention strategies based on the system’s data, FME\-CTU tutors have reduced this failure rate to an average of 19% between 2015/16 and 2018/19. As a result, 422 additional students have advanced to second and third\-year study **\[C1\]**. In a November 2020 letter, the Vice\-Dean for Education at FME\-CTU states that the system’s success in the early identification of at\-risk students had enhanced the “ *general wellbeing prospects for affected students*” and the institution **\[C1\]**. Each year, the Czech Ministry of Education grants funding to the Czech Technical University on the basis of the overall number of students. In his letter, the Vice\-Dean explains that the improved student retention delivered by StudentAnalyse for the four academic years, from 2015/16 to 2018/19, has resulted in a total additional financial income of CZK27,900,000 **\[C1\]**. Converted at the average exchange rate during these years, this corresponds to approximately GBP950,000. 

 StudentAnalyse also provided additional benefits to FME\-CTU during its response to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The Vice\-Dean noted that the faculty was able to deploy learning strategies proven successful by the system since 2015/16, “ *to move to fully online teaching by redesigning the exam strategy for the whole undergraduate programme*” **\[C1\]**. As a result, they explained, all of the faculty’s 2,251 students continued to receive “ *all essential educational functions with the maximum possible care for the health and safety of both students and staff*” **\[C1\]**. 

 **Improving professional practice, student outcomes and retention rates at The Open University** 

 Improving student retention is a critical strategic priority for The Open University \(OU\). As a distance teaching institution, the university has historically suffered from higher\-than\-average drop\-out rates. In the five academic years to 2015/16, an average of 30% of students abandoned their studies in the first year, 20% more than the average among UK higher education institutions **\[C2\]**. Since 2015, **Zdrahal** and **Hlosta** have piloted predictive learning analytics solutions to this problem, based on their research **\[O1\-O4\]**. The product of these pilots, the OUAnalyse platform **\[O5\]**, has had demonstrable success in three critical ways: 

1.  OUAnalyse usage by tutors is now one of the two significant predictors of whether students will complete and pass a course, alongside previous best score. 

1.  Teachers who regularly access the student performance platform have better student retention rates. Those who use it at least 41% of the time have average student retention of 56%, compared to 48% for those who do either limited or no use of the platform. 

1.  Teachers had better student outcomes in the years they used OUAnalyse than in previous years **\[C2\]**. 

 In a November 2020 letter, The Open University’s Director for Students explained how, in April 2019, this evidence “ *led the university internal review panel to recommend using Predictive Learning Analytics in all faculties*” **\[C2\]**. They also described how, as a result of this decision, from November 2020 “ *all of the OU’s 3,581 tutors in the undergraduate modules have been given training materials on how to use OUAnalyse directly in their primary teaching portal \- TutorHome. As such, Learning Analytics and monitoring students’ progress using OUAnalyse has become part of teaching for 118,963 students*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Interviews with tutors also reveal that using OUAnalyse complements existing teaching practices. In feedback collected by email in December 2019, Open University tutors wrote that the system is “ *the best method*” for monitoring student performance they have worked with and provides an efficient way “ *to work out if there may be potential problems*” **\[C3**, p.2 **\]**. Others explained that OUAnalyse “ *pushed*” them to monitor and contact struggling students more quickly than they usually would. One tutor, who explained they had a particularly challenging group, said that without OUAnalyse, they “ *would have lost around four or five of them, but all of them made it ‘til the end and passed*” **\[C3**, p.2 and p.3 **\]**. 

 In its 2016 report, From Bricks to Clicks, which includes an entire case study about the use of OUAnalyse at The Open University, the UK House of Lords’ Higher Education Commission pointed out that “ *apart from the OU the Commission does not believe that any UK institution has made significant headway in this area*” **\[C4**, p.53 **\]**. Finally, in September 2020, the DataIQ Awards recognised OUAnalyse by awarding the prize for ‘Best use of data by a not\-for\-profit organisation’ **\[C5\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Establishing and growth of Vision Schools Scotland \(VSS\), an organisation that supports teachers in their teaching of the Holocaust and Citizenship and a novel approach to Holocaust education across Scotland’s Schools as well as internationally through Yad Vashem, IHRA, UNESCO, and EUROCLIO to hundreds of thousands of teachers worldwide are key achievements of our research. VSS network comprises 40 schools from 16 unitary local authorities in Scotland \(approximately 100 teachers and 30,000 school students\). Impact is further demonstrated by participation in international teaching resources that are translated into many languages and used by thousands of educators worldwide. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 While it builds on the REF 2014 impact case study “School\-Based Holocaust Education in Scotland” new underpinning research has been conducted and it continues to inform politicians, policy makers and practitioners. The impact of the new research reported in this case study emerges from research conducted by **Cowan, Dombrowski,** **Henderson** and **Maitles**. Empirical research involves approximately 600 young people aged 10\-19, 50 teachers, 6 parents and museum educators. 

 The first two empirical research studies, continue to impact on current policy and practice of internationally recognised Holocaust education in Scotland. **\[3.1\]** explored Scottish upper primary pupils’ citizenship values and attitudes. Findings that pupils who had studied the Holocaust demonstrated more positive attitudes to minority and disadvantaged groups than their peers who had not studied the Holocaust suggested clear benefits of school based Holocaust education \(238 pupils\). Findings of **\[3.2\]** were that student participation in the Lessons From Auschwitz experiential programme contributed significantly to their citizenship development and motivated teaching of the Holocaust and Human Rights Education \(326 pupils\). 

  

 **\[3.3, 3.A\]** was pioneering in that it focused on parental attitudes in the primary context. Its findings were that parental concerns were not in themselves a barrier to teaching the Holocaust in the primary context, but can be addressed through the class teacher’s communication with parents, and careful planning of activities that met students’ learning needs and abilities. Further findings suggested that extended learning had occurred as parents demonstrated that they had learned about the Holocaust through their children. 

 **\[3.4\]** concerns the outcomes of a PhD studentship \(awarded in 2015\), co\-authored with **Dombrowski**, a member of the academic staff, which explored different approaches to theorising pedagogy via the Auschwitz\-Birkenau State Museum case study. Using an ‘ontoepistemological’ and place\-responsive approach to theorise the teaching and learning of the Holocaust, the findings challenged academics and practitioners to critique how particular methods of researching Holocaust education have tended to dominate the field, and proposed that this may have limited innovation in the field of Holocaust education itself. **Henderson’s** research on Auschwitz\-Birkenau has provided insight for teachers and museum educators. Based on her PhD findings, Henderson proposed a place\-responsive approach to pedagogy, and the resultant model is application of this approach in another educational context. Henderson was awarded a Carnegie Research Incentive Grant \(2017/18\), to assess this approach with community stakeholders in an industrial heritage educational context. 

 **Cowan** and **Maitles’** book **\[3.5\]** was based on their body of research conducted between 2005 and 2015, demonstrating continuity and development of their research. Awarded Best Praxis Publication 2017, by the Children's Identity and Citizenship in Europe network, this book has received highly positive reviews from national educational publications and organisations, and Yad Vashem, Jerusalem. The UK National Holocaust Museum and Centre purchased this book for distribution to their partner schools \(approximately 100 schools\) and teachers have reported positively on its practical use. Further, the book is included as a suggested resource for educators on the Department of Education’s, Winnipeg website. Its authors have been invited to speak \(during COVID these have been online webinars\) by national organisations such as The Holocaust Education Centre \(50 educators\), Huddersfield; the Scottish Association for the Teaching in English \(approximately 400 teachers across social media platforms\); equality representatives of the Educational Institute of Scotland \(EIS\) \(approximately 100\) and by BBC Radio Scotland \(767,000 average listeners\). 

 **\[3.6\]** highlighted the distinctive features of Holocaust education in Scotland by making comparisons to England, and examining Scotland’s connections with the Holocaust. This updated previous discursive research reported in the 2014 impact case study.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Scotland’s Schools \(total population of **700,000 pupils** and **55,000 teachers**\) as well as internationally **Yad Vashem** **\(Israel\)**, **IHRA \(34 member countries\)**, **UNESCO**, and **EUROCLIO** **\(47 countries\),** with a reach to hundreds of thousands of teachers worldwide, are the main beneficiaries of our research. 

 The former is demonstrated by Cowan and Henderson’s individual contributions to the **Scottish Holocaust\-Era Study Centre** \(since 2013\), organised by the **Scottish Jewish Archives Centre**. Cowan has been appointed education adviser, and Henderson, a consultant **\[5.1\].** Cowan’s participation on the **Holocaust Memorial Day \(Scotland\) Planning Group** \(since 2011\) has led to incrementally more schools’ involvement in local and national Holocaust memorial events. 

 Cowan is also **director of Vision Schools Scotland \(VSS\)**, a national schools’ accreditation programme in Holocaust education. Piloted in 2015, and launched in 2017, this programme has been set up by the University, in partnership with the Holocaust Educational Trust. Its main purposes are to accredit good teaching of the Holocaust in primary and secondary schools and support teachers by creating a schools’ network and delivering regular CPD. The Deputy First Minister and Education Minister addressed the VSS launch and has met with Cowan to discuss ways in which the Scottish Government can continue to support this programme **\[5.2\].** This programme is continuing to impact on schools across Scotland, and the 2020 Time For Reflection to the Chamber at the Scottish Parliament focused on the work of VSS. Further evidence of impact of VSS is demonstrated through its website, blog and Twitter account, as well as its reach in the local media, highlighting the positive impact of Vision Schools Scotland on school children and teachers in the local community. In 2019, media outlets in Glasgow and Renfrewshire reported on the success of their local schools’ involvement with Vision Schools Scotland. Following working with VSS, each school had then been recognised for leading Holocaust educational initiatives, some of which were awarded the highest possible status for good practice in Holocaust education after their exposure to the programme **\[5.11\].** While UK educators and PhD students are its largest Twitter audience, its reach extends to **Europe**, **North America** and includes MSPs, journalists and authors. Cowan and Maitles have been delivering Continuous Professional Development \(CPD\) programmes on Holocaust education for teachers since 2016 **\[5.3\-5.5\].** 

 The influence is also achieved by Cowan being appointed as external expert by the **European Association of History Educators** on the Rethink Project on Remembrance Education \(2018/19\) **\[5.6\]** and is one of the authors of the IHRA Recommendations for Teaching and Learning The Holocaust \(2019\) which has been endorsed by **UNESCO** **\[5.7\]**, translated into Croatian, Estonian, German, Macedonian, Norwegian, and Polish, and \(at time of writing\) in the process of translation by several other countries. This resource is being used worldwide. Cowan was a speaker at a webinar organised by UK United Synagogues and the National Holocaust Centre and Museum to commemorate *Kristallnacht,* in 2020 \(approximately 1000 viewers\) **\[5.7\]**. As a result of her pioneering work, Cowan has been invited onto the forthcoming Education Advisory Group of the **UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation** \(2021\). 

 Further international impact is shown by Cowan receiving the **CiCea Outstanding Achievement** award for her outstanding work in Citizenship and Holocaust Education \(2015\), her continued appointment \(since 2009\) on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance **\[5.8\]** and her co\-editing of the first academic text that focused on teaching the Holocaust to primary aged students in school and museum contexts **\[5.7\]**. Maitles and Cowan’s earlier research on citizenship education is cited in a UNESCO publication **\[5.9\]**. Finally, Maitles was invited to influence political leaders and religious dignitaries \(approximately 200\), at the ‘An End to Antisemitism’ conference \(Vienna, 2018\) on ‘ *Does learning about genocide impact on the values of young people? A case study from Scotland’*. 

  

 The School of Education and Social Sciences’ collaboration with **Yad Vashem \(the world’s foremost centre for Holocaust education\)** has involved undergraduate video\-conference lectures and an annual visit involving students and teachers to Yad Vashem for international seminars/tutorials on understanding and teaching the Holocaust. Evaluations completed by the incumbent and practising teachers has been consistently positive, with participants reflecting on how much this has influenced their practice in the classroom in terms of Holocaust education. This collaboration \(as is borne out by **\[5.10\]**\) is due primarily to the research carried out by Cowan and Maitles, since 2005, on aspects concerning global citizenship such as antisemitism and racism, pedagogies that teachers adopt to teach the Holocaust in schools and the impact of Holocaust education on school students.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research at the University of Bath directly informed changes in practice and policy on the assessment, monitoring, and management of growth and maturation in young athletes.  This included more than 3,000 premiership football academy players, leading to a 89% reduction in maturity associated coach evaluation biases and a decrease of 16% in maturity associated player selection biases. This led to a significant reduction in time\-loss injuries from 10.1 per 1,000 hours to 3.9 per 1,000 hours \(62% decrease\) in players undergoing a growth spurt. These impacts were facilitated by the design and implementation of \(1\) screening programmes and policies; \(2\) modules within athlete performance and data management systems; \(3\) certified educational programmes and learning resources; and \(4\) evidence\-based strategies for managing growth and maturation in young athletes. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Researchers from University of Bath contributing to these impacts include four members of academic staff \(Dr Cumming, Dr Gillison, 2014\-21; Dr Williams, Dr McGee, 2016\-21\). The aims of the research were to: 1\) develop and validate non\-invasive methods for assessing and monitoring growth and maturation in youth; 2\) better understand the role of growth and maturation in talent identification and development; and 3\) design and evaluate applied strategies for managing growth and maturation in young athletes, with specific emphasis on maturity associated selection biases and injury risk. 

 **Challenges of Individual Variation in Physical Maturity** 

 Variance in the growth and maturity of children adversely impacts the processes of talent identification and development in youth sports, presenting significant challenges for athletes, coaches and practitioners. In 2012, the Premier League and Football Association prioritised more effective assessment, monitoring and management of growth and maturity as a key strategy in their long\-term athlete development strategy. In 2015, collaborating with the Premier League, its clubs, and industry partners, Bath academics conducted a programme of research that supported and enabled the achievement of these objectives. 

 **Development of a valid non\-invasive method of assessing and monitoring maturation** 

 In a series of studies \(from 2006 to 2020\), Drs. Cumming, Gillison et al., integrated algorithms for predicting adult stature in youth with North American and UK growth reference standards, to create new techniques and protocols to estimate maturational status and timing, onset of the pubertal growth spurt, and ‘biological age’ in youth \(2.1, 2.2, 2.3\). Validated against gold standard measures \(skeletal age, observed at peak height velocity\) \(2.1, 2.3\), these non\-invasive methods were found to afford more accurate and reliable estimates of maturation status, timing, and the onset of the pubertal growth spurt, than existing methods \(2.1, 2.3\). 

 **Differences in maturation lead to selection biases and injury incidence** 

 From 2012 to 2020, across multiple sports \(football, rugby, dance, tennis\), Drs. Cumming, McGee et al., identified maturity\-associated selection biases that emerge at puberty, increase with age, and exist independent of related phenomena \(relative age\) \(2.3, 2.4\). Further studies, including Dr Williams, elucidated the many physical \(size, speed, power, strength, momentum\) and psychosocial \(coach evaluations, self\-perceptions\) factors and mechanisms contributing toward the biases, establishing the evidence base for subsequent applied research.  Notably, we were the first to demonstrate an ‘underdog effect’ in academy football, whereby late maturing players had to possess more adaptive learning strategies to survive in the system, how the timing of maturity and growth spurt adversely impacted coaches’ evaluations of match performance, and how the growth spurt more than doubles injury incidence and burden in academy football \(2.5\). 

 **Development, implementation and evaluation of strategies to counter maturity\-associated biases and injury risks** 

 In 2015, and in collaboration with the Premier League and its member clubs, we pioneered research on the practice of bio\-banding; demonstrating that maturity matched game formats differentially benefitted early and late maturing players via the affordance of novel and developmentally appropriate challenges and learning opportunities \(2.6\).  Research on the association between maturation status and injury incidence/burden, also provided the crucial evidence base for the application of bio\-banding principles in training \(2.5\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Impact has been achieved at the levels of: \(1\) national screening programmes and policies; \(2\) modules embedded within athlete performance and data management systems; \(3\) certified educational courses and learning resources; \(4\) developmental strategies for managing growth and maturation in young athletes \(bio\-banding\); \(5\) reductions in player evaluation and selection biases and \(6\) reductions in injury incidence.  Beneficiaries include athletes, coaches, sports science/medical practitioners, governing bodies \(Premier League, FA., US Soccer,\) and professional sports teams \(Manchester Utd, Southampton, AFC Bournemouth\). 

 **1: Policy and practice** 

 University of Bath research directly informed practice and policy pertaining to growth and maturation assessment in young athletes. As part of the Premier League’s Elite Player Performance Plan, Dr Cumming chaired \(August 2013\) an expert advisory panel to “ *inform the league’s policies and practice with respect to the assessment and monitoring of growth and maturation in academy footballers*” \(4.1, 4.2, 4.3\). Methods and protocols validated through our research were embedded within the league’s subsequent Growth and Maturation Screening Programme and accompanying policy and guidance \(Premier League Youth Development Rules, 106, 209.2, 209.5\), impacting more than 3,000 registered players at Premier League academies \(4.3\).  Compliance with league policies is required for all registered academies and monitored through an independent audit and accreditation process. 

 **2: Assessment and monitoring of growth and maturation** 

 *“Dr Cumming has enabled us to identify a systematic bias towards early maturing players within our academy system, …the mechanisms that underpin this bias … and the most accurate methods predicting when players enter important phases of development”* Dr Hawkins, Head of Physical Performance, Manchester United FC \(4.8\). 

 University of Bath research transformed how governing bodies and professional clubs document, monitor, communicate, and utilise information pertaining to growth and maturation, in football and also tennis \(4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8\-4.10\). Supporting the Premier League’s ‘Growth and Maturation Screening Programme’, we collaborated with The Sports Office Ltd., \(between December 2014 and September 2016\), to design and embed a ‘growth and maturation module’ within the ‘Player Management Application’; a performance and data management system monitoring all registered players in Premier League and Category one academies \(4.2, 4.5\). The module affords more reliable and accurate assessment of growth and maturity and is now routinely used to \(1\) assess growth and maturation status, \(2\) generate and access on\-demand player and team audit reports, \(3\) group players by maturational bio\-bands for training/competition, \(4\) inform training design and prescription, \(5\) evaluate player fitness and performance relative to age and maturational standards, and \(6\) identify developmental stages associated with greater injury risk \(growth spurt\) \(4.8\-4.10\). Launched in 2016, the module collected over 79,000 maturation data points from over 11,000 registered academy players aged 9 to 16 years \(4.5\). 

 **3.  Education** 

 *“As a club, we directly benefitted from Dr Cumming’s involvement in the Premier League’s Growth and Maturation Screening Programme.… our academy staff are now more knowledgeable and better\-qualified to accurately assess, monitor the physical development of our players. … make developmentally\-informed decisions regarding the identification and assessment of talent, and the prescription of individualised training programmes”  Academy Head of Sports Science, AFC Bournemouth* \(4.10\). 

 Societal impact has been achieved through dissemination of maturity specific evidence\-based educational programmes and learning resources for practitioners \(4.1,4.2\).  Bath research informed the design of a certified professional development course on growth and maturation in academy footballers. Supporting the Premier League’s Growth and Maturation Screening Programme \(4.1,4.2\) this course has been completed by over 150 league\-registered academy sports science and medical practitioners across 27 clubs. In 2016, we designed an equivalent evidence\-based educational workshop for the Football Association as part of their Advanced Youth Award, which has been delivered to more than 800 professional coaches. 

 **4. Improved coaching practices and lowered injury burden for athletes** 

 *“Dr Cumming worked with us to pioneer the concept of bio\-banding….The success of the research collaboration led to the introduction of bio\-banding within the Academy games programme in 2016”   Head of Elite Performance, Premier League \(4.2\).* 

 Research on ‘bio\-banding’ led to the endorsement of this strategy by the Premier League, and its inclusion within the Academy Games Programme in 2015 \(4.2\). Players and coaches at multiple premier league clubs \(Arsenal, Manchester United, Brighton, Southampton & Bournemouth\) now benefit from this practice in training and competition \(4.2, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10\).  AFC Bournemouth began to bio\-band players’ conditioning programmes in the 2019\-20 season, resulting in a reduction in the occurrence of time loss injuries from 10.1 per 1,000 hours to 3.9 per 1,000 hours for players during mid\-growth spurt; **representing a 62% lower injury rate** \(4.10\). Southampton also integrated bio\-banding across their games programme and player evaluation processes, observing 16% and 89% reductions in player selection and coach evaluation biases towards more mature players during the 2019\-20 season \(4.9\). Bio\-banding is now being expanded across the globe by professional clubs and governing bodies in USA, Switzerland, Scotland, Poland, France, Netherlands, Canada, and Australia, and also into other sports such as tennis.  In 2018, US Soccer endorsed bio\-banding as one of three innovative strategies within its high\-performance programme, with investments of “$1,500,000” \[USD1,500,000\] \(4.6, 4.7\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Cardiff Met has enhanced the use of technology in teaching modern languages nationally and internationally. Funded by grants totaling €804K, two phases of the Interactive Technologies in Language Teaching \(ITiLT\) project impacted the communicative language teaching and pedagogical practice of over 9,300 educators benefitting an estimated 50,000 pupils and students across Europe and Eurasia. Course materials were produced in 6 languages and 1,327 teaching practitioners attended ITiLT workshops. ITiLT was designated as a ‘Success Story’ by Erasmus\+, a category reserved for projects that have distinguished themselves by their impact, contribution to policy\-making, innovative results or creative approach, and that might be a source of inspiration to others. The project’s events website recorded 36,013 hits in addition to more than 82,000 on content curation site Scoop.it.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Background and context 

 It has been widely acknowledged for some time that technology has the *potential* to foster better communication and more interactive and effective pedagogical practice. This potential is not often realised, and where teachers have used technology, its use can best be depicted as ‘technical interactivity’, rather than the ‘pedagogical interactivity’ needed to promote effective learning. On joining Cardiff Met in 2007, Beauchamp had recently completed a £114,794 ESRC and British Educational Communications and Technology Agency \(BECTA\) \-funded research project, examining how technology might best be deployed to develop interactive teaching. Beauchamp subsequently used the findings of this work to develop an analysis framework to assess how effectively teachers use of Information and Communication Technology \(ICT\) in teaching practice, with a particular focus on Interactive Whiteboards \(IWB\). The results revealed considerable variation in the effectiveness of technology use in classrooms and the potential of classroom video recording as a facilitator of reflective dialogue centred on effective practice with teachers. Similar issues around the use of ICT in language teaching classrooms across Europe provided the impetus for Beauchamp’s invitation to join Phase 1 of the Interactive Technologies in Language Teaching \(ITiLT\) project between 2011 and 2013, facilitated by a €525,945 Erasmus\+ programme grant that also funded Abbinett’s appointment as an RA. The success of that work led to an additional EU grant of €278,252 for Phase 2 of ITiLT between 2014 and 2017. The primary aim of Phase 2 was to enhance the effective use of a wider range of technologies in task\-based language teaching to improve language educators’ efficacy with technology and its use in their pedagogical practice \[R1\]. 

 Outcomes 

 Through its European partnerships in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Turkey and Spain, ITiLT research culminated in a range of resources related to use of technology for the professional development of classroom teachers and university lecturers. The research revealed a lack of confidence in using interactive technologies that caused many teachers and lecturers to only use a very limited set of ICT features to support learning. Some were more confident in the technical use of interactive technologies but less confident in developing new pedagogic approaches to exploit ICT’s full potential \[R2\]. ITiLT underpinned the development of rubrics for participant configuration and orchestration of learning \[R3, R4, R5\]. The project identified that the predominant patterns of classroom organisation were educator, rather than learner\-centred, particularly in the case of younger learners. This insight enabled the development of a video coding framework for analysing IWB\-mediated language teaching and the use of technology tools/features \[R6\]. Beauchamp and Abbinett consequently advocated a shift towards a greater role for lecturers, teachers and learners in schools in orchestrating resources in the classroom and concluded that there is potential for educators and learners to come to  shared realisation of the pedagogic potential of interactive technologies in teaching and learning \[R1\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Beauchamp** and **Abbinett’s** work fundamentally changed the pedagogical use of technology in language teaching in seven countries spanning Europe and Eurasia, reaching well over 9,300 educational practitioners and student teachers \[E1\]. Resources from the ITiLT project have been produced in six different languages, namely French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Turkish and English. The final Erasmus\+ assessment report of ITiLT concluded that “There is substantial evidence of impact on participants and their organisations at local and wider levels” \[E2\]. ITiLT was independently evaluated at 88/100 and designated as a ‘Success Story’ by Erasmus\+, a category reserved for projects that have distinguished themselves by their impact, contribution to policy\-making, innovative results or creative approach, and that might be a source of inspiration to others \[E3\]. 

 The final report for Phase 1 of the project concluded that “the whole team has reached over **9,300** people with their dissemination activities’ over seven countries” \[E2\]. The Phase 2 final report \(2017\) concluded that there had been an impact on “a minimum of nearly **1700** students in five countries to date” and “potential for over **500** more each successive year” \[E4\]. Multiplier events – during which educators trained other teachers in using the technology – increased the research’s reach: “In total, at least **1,327** attended all dissemination events by partners, and online hits were **36,013** for these events, in addition to **82,000** on Scoop.it.**Footnote:**

 Scoop.it is a content engine that monitors global sources to find and curate relevant third\-party content. 
” \[E4\]. The Project lead of Phase 1 estimated that, based on an average class size of 25, over a period of 3 to 4 years, the learning of more than 50,000 students had been impacted \[E5\]. 

 Evaluations of multiplier events completed by classroom teachers internationally showed a series of positive impacts: 

-  95% agreed that *‘I found the event valuable to support my professional development’*; 

-  91% agreed that *'The event has given me ideas that I can use in my classroom’*; 

-  89% agreed that *‘The event has given me ideas that I can share with my colleagues’*; 

 ITiLT mainly reached educators in higher education, in\-service and pre\-service classroom language teachers, and teacher educators who needed pedagogical support for the design and implementation of technology\-enhanced language lessons. The active involvement of teachers, pupils and lecturers as real collaborators in planning, delivering and recording their lessons, has ensured that ITiLT resources definitively affected teachers’ thinking and pedagogical practice: “This hands\-on and yet solid approach was and is still inspiring to me in my teaching practice.” \[E6\]. The ‘research\-based pedagogy’ has proven especially valuable with education researchers who are training the next generation of educators. For example, a Durham University Professor reported: “I have been able to pass on these developments to over **600 initial teacher education students** in my teaching at Durham. I have also been able to demonstrate and inform over **400 teachers in Norway** through a collaboration with the Norwegian Business School \(BI\) in Oslo” and *“*\[ITiLT has\] altered the way that I have approached the use of IWBs in the classroom, and how I support future teachers in the use of IWBs in the classroom” \[E7\]. 

 The project’s website \[E8\] has been made available beyond the end of the project. It has been used by teaching practitioners in Europe, North America, Australia and Turkey. The website hosts: 

-  117 video examples of the use of interactive technologies in second\-language teaching; 

-  a comprehensive professional development e\-resource, including a series of mini\-guides; and 

-  an extensive online library. 

 These resources continue to be widely used. A *Université Côte d’Azur* Professor has personally used it in the teaching of between 500 and 800 students: *“*\[I have\] used the website in pre\- and in\-service teacher education with undergraduate classes \(25\-80 students in third\-year English from 2011 onwards\) and masters’ classes for pre\-service primary and secondary teachers \(50\-80 students per year since 2011\). To my knowledge the ITILT project websites are used by colleagues at other French universities \(Université Grenoble\-Alpes\) and I have also used them in workshops \(Ireland2017, Norway 2018, French universities and school authorities from 2011\) and webinars \(Germany 2013, 2016, Canada 2014, Belgium 2017, UK 2018\) attracting an average of around 50 participants.” \[E9\] 

 Web resources are also shared through professional bodies and networks such as European Schoolnet, a not\-for\-profit network of 34 European Ministries of Education which supports schools and teachers to bring innovation in teaching and learning with a particular focus on ICT and digitization \[E5\] and which features ITiLT prominently on its webpages \[E10\]. 

 In summary, ITiLT has had a significant impact on language educators across Europe, transforming their teaching practice and promoting enhanced learning for tens of thousands of pupils and students.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 There is a persistent and chronic absence of authentic representation of intellectual disability \(ID\) in TV and film. Portrayals that do appear are often regressive, reinforcing negative or inaccurate stereotypes. Practice\-led research undertaken at Northumbria University by academic and film director Len Collin, led to the production of *Sanctuary* \(2016\), a critically acclaimed feature film employing a cast of actors with ID that has been shown on every continent and received 4 international awards. Through the making of *Sanctuary,* Collin’s research has **1\)** played a significant role in raising awareness of the marginalised status of actors with ID across the film industry. This improved profile has **2**\) helped to increase the use of authentic casting in recent productions and empowered actors with ID in their career pursuits. Similar developments were replicated in a major UK care service, **3\)** who changed their practices in response to *Sanctuary*, creating new opportunities for individuals who use their service to enjoy a greater degree of autonomy and ability to shape the structure of their care provision. Finally, **4**\) Collin’s work played an instrumental role in repealing Irish legislation that had restricted the rights of people with ID to intimacy, a vital contribution recognised by advocacy groups and Ireland’s Minister for Disabilities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Recent scholarly assessments of the importance of authentic casting in theatre and performance, as well as contemporary media industry debate about authentic casting in film and TV, have largely centred on non\-white and non\-trans actors in BAME and trans roles. Until recently, there was little focus on the authentic casting of disabled actors. The practice\-based research activity of Collin, in making the feature film *Sanctuary* \[ **R1a**\] addresses this gap. It pushes back at established industry norms, which customarily take the contentious route of telling stories about disability by casting actors without disabilities to play those roles. The best\-known international examples include Dustin Hoffman in *Rain Man* \(1988\) and Tom Hanks in *Forrest Gump* \(1994\). Portrayal of characters with ID \(also known as LD or learning disability\) by actors with ID has not improved over time, and the Ruderman White Paper identified that film industry casting actors authentically was rare, at just 5% in 2016. 

 Following Robert McRuer’s work on ‘crip theory’, Collin has identified such practices as ‘cripping up’ \(after Kaite O’Reilly\) \[ **R1b**\] by non\-disabled actors. He has drawn upon insights from queer theory and disability studies to help create critically disabled spaces \[ **R1c**\]. In particular, Collin’s film *Sanctuary* addressed issues raised by those studies of the failure of progress in authentic casting and concluded that this has led to disability tropes and stereotypes being repeated in the industry, perpetuating poor on\-screen representations of people with disabilities. In his subsequent film, *Altered Thinking* \(2020\) \[ **R1c**\], Collin places the making of *Sanctuary* in critical relation to the legacy of ‘cripping up’ in film history. 

 *Sanctuary* \[ **R1a**\] was directed and script\-edited by Collin, based on the play by Christian O’Reilly. The film follows Larry, a man with Down’s Syndrome, and Sophie, who has epilepsy, navigating the Irish law \(Section 5 of the Criminal Law \(Sexual Offences\) Act of 1993\) that makes it illegal for them to have sex unless they are married. The film is set on a day out from the training centre they and the group attend, providing them with the opportunity to explore freedoms so often denied them, at the expense of well\-meaning carer Tom. The film features a principal cast with Intellectual Disabilities \(ID\) – a term covering a range of conditions, including Autism and Down’s Syndrome. 

 The research explored ethical changes to film production norms required when working directly with ID actors. Focusing on two specific areas of questioning, Collin asked \(i\) in what ways might authentic casting encourage paradigmatic change in the representation of people with ID in cinema, while \(ii\) interrogating what changes to the mechanics of production and improvisatory working methods might need to be considered to bring this about. In his 2020 book chapter *Shooting Actors Who Have Intellectual Disabilities* \[ **R1b**\] Collin outlines the innovative practice\-based methodologies of narrative feature\-film production that were trialled to explore how the actors could develop greater agency in the filmmaking process, resulting in more accurate on\-screen representations of ID. 

 The body of research constituting *Sanctuary* \[ **R1**\] started in 2014, when Collin began to conduct workshops for camera with the Blue Teapot Theatre Company, Galway – a company of actors with intellectual disabilities who had already performed Sanctuary as a play. Collin filmed, edited, and screened the actors’ work in the workshops. This enabled the actors to understand continuity editing, camera set\-ups, and shot sizes. They could see themselves on screen and adapt their performances accordingly. Collin took the workshops into locations such as a park, cinema, and hotel room to familiarise the actors with the processes of filming \[ **R1b**\]. Through the visual, spoken, and editorial language of documentary filmmaking, *Altered Thinking* \[ **R1c**\] reveals the nuanced methodologies evolved by Collin. These enabled him to help move the ID cast from the paradigm of theatre to that of film, paying particular attention to the cast’s welfare, as well as to the specific physical and psychological pressures that the filmmaking process placed on them. 

 *Sanctuary* was released in 2017 and awarded Best Film at Moscow’s Breaking Barriers Film Festival \(2018\), Best Irish Film by the Dublin Film Critics Circle \(2017\), and Best Director at the Newport Beach Film Festival \(2017\). The cast won the Michael Dwyer Discovery Award at the Audi Dublin International Film Festival \(2017\). *Sanctuary* opened the ReelAbilities New York Film Festival and was further screened at: Camerimage, Poland; Geena Davis’ Bentonville Film Festival; and the Irish Film Festival in Melbourne, Australia. Collin has been invited to speak about *Sanctuary* on international panels including What’s The Diff? Deakin University Melbourne \(2020\) and the Sao Paulo XV Symposium of Irish Studies in South America \(2020\), as well as chairing a panel at Breaking Down Barriers International Film Festival, Moscow \(2020\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Original practice\-led research, which facilitated authentic casting of actors with intellectual disabilities \(ID\), allowed Collin to successfully translate *Sanctuary* from stage to screen. The film was a commercial and critical success, reaching millions of viewers with its compelling story, told through a cast of predominantly ID actors. By helping to promote and improve awareness of ID, Collin’s work has become an effective advocacy tool, leading to changes in the film industry, as well as care services in Ireland and the UK. The film proved to be instrumental in supporting lobbying efforts to repeal Irish legislation that had prevented individuals with an ID from pursuing intimate relationships. 

 **4.1 Improving awareness and promoting representation of ID** 

 *Sanctuary* has toured every continent, receiving multiple awards and screenings at film festivals, as well as within educational and welfare settings. In July 2017 and December 2017, *Sanctuary* was released in cinemas across Ireland and the UK. The film was also made available to Access Cinema – an EU\-funded company that takes cinema to remote and unusual locations. It won the Access Cinemas award for the film that made the most impact on their circuit for 2017 \[ **E1**\]. Online, the film has been available on Sky, YouTube, iTunes, Hulu in the USA, and Volta in Ireland \[ **E2**\]. Reviews on Amazon Prime Video for example, noted the power of the film’s combination of comedy and pathos, the performances and the message of the film that encourages society to see people with ID as fully rounded human beings \[ **E3**, p1\]. *The Guardian* described the film as *‘valuable’* \[ **E3**, p2\] with a BFI review commenting on its *‘radical’* and ‘ *powerful message* \[about casting\] … *Sanctuary conforms to no stereotype; it is about people wanting to lead ordinary lives on their own terms’* \[ **E3**, p3\] *.* 

 The success of *Sanctuary* helped to challenge conventional wisdom about the depiction of intellectual disability in film. The *London Evening Standard* – which gave the film five stars and rated it one of its films of the year – noted how the film *‘is full of bodies rarely seen on the big screen’* \[ **E3**, p4\], while the *Irish Times* stated *‘it remains unusual to see the ID on film, so a film starring nine such actors is exceptional even before the opening credits roll’* \[ **E3**, p5\]. *Film Ireland* saw Collin’s work as *‘one of the most ambitious, innovative and deeply moving Irish films of recent times…* \[an achievement\] *all the more impressive when one considers how rarely ID actors have featured prominently in fiction film*’ \[ **E3**, p6\]. 

 The discussions stimulated by *Sanctuary* in the UK entertainment industry led to new activity to support the film and casting of ID actors more broadly. Filmmaker\-producer David Wilkinson, founder of distribution company Guerrilla Films confirmed that following his formal attendance at the film’s premiere \(Galway Film Festival, 2016\), he was convinced to lead a UK\-wide distribution \[ **E4**\]. This decision was a result of a change in attitudes brought about by the film, *‘I was expecting to be preached to* … \[but realised\] *""Oh hang on a minute, this is interesting\!"" And then I began to laugh. And that may seem odd, but when you're a film professional, I've found that you look at a film in a different way, and so laughing is something that doesn't come easy, particularly to distributors’* \[ **E4**\]. Wilkinson wrote a review praising *Sanctuary’s* use of authentic casting, which had also challenged his prejudices and those of the broader film industry \[ **E4**\]. 

 Other filmmakers have approached Collin to discuss authentic casting and working with ID actors, empowering them to cast actors with ID when they might otherwise have employed non\-ID actors. The writer and director of the BBC film *Ups and Downs* \(2017\) \[ **E5**, p1\], discussed casting the lead character of his film who has Down’s Syndrome \[ **E5**, p2\]. More recently, another screenwriter\-filmmaker worked with Collin on a new proposal for Screen Ireland, for a film about a woman with ID befriending a young girl and the misunderstandings that arise as a result. Collin advised the producer on the value of casting a lead with ID and was subsequently credited with strengthening the application that was successful \[ **E6**\]. 

 **4.2 Empowering actors with an ID and supporting the promotion of authentic casting** 

 The success of *Sanctuary* also resulted in significant benefits for the actors and the theatrical company they work with. Petal Pilley – CEO, Blue Teapot – noted the effect was *‘absolutely massive*, \[they\] *are completely empowered …that people interact* \[and say\] *""I've seen you"", you know just to be met on the street* \[and be told\] *""I saw, you were wonderful"" …not many of us get that kind of interaction walking up our local high street, but they do*’ \[ **E7**\]. 

 The film’s success has seen the cast successfully audition for new roles, *‘they are getting approached so that confidence is definitely shifted’* \[ **E7**\]. Newfound confidence resulted in one of the lead actors requesting and moving into her own apartment, *‘they're not afraid to say what they think and feel, and I think you know that's really priceless’* \[ **E7**\]. Following the release of *Sanctuary*, *‘the arts council sat up finally…* \[the film\] *completely elevated the status of* \[Blue Teapot\] *internationally* \[and\] *…our capacity to carry a really important message, which is that the great artists, the great actors, they do great work’* \[ **E7**\]. This has helped inspire younger/newer artists who want to develop as actors: *‘""there's me Oh\! I might be able to do that"" …that encouragement is huge’* \[ **E7**\]. Direct responses from actors were due to be collected in Summer 2020, through filmed in\-person interviews but this was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic and travel restrictions. Interviews were not conducted remotely for ethical and safeguarding reasons. 

 **4.3 Supporting changes to health and care practices** 

 Collin’s work has initiated broader discussions about the need for changes in the Irish and UK care sectors to promote greater independence. Vivo Care Choices \(Vivo\) – the principal care provider for Cheshire West and Chester Council – is a case in point. MD Alistair Jeffs outlined how – typically for the care sector – Vivo has struggled to support service users wanting a more flexible approach to social relationships outside of the formal care environment, something Jeffs noted was often discouraged by family, friends, and care providers *‘because it didn't quite fit in with their view of perhaps what was right or appropriate for the individuals or didn't fit into what they could afford to deliver’* \[ **E8**\]. 

 Vivo connected with Collin following the success of *Sanctuary*. As well as showing the film as part of the Chester Kaleidoscope festival – aiming to raise the profile of people with ID – Collin used the film to facilitate workshops with Vivo staff and service users \[ **E8**\]. Jeffs confirms how these events were *‘truly inspirational’* \[ **E8**\]. As a result of engaging with Collin’s work, Vivo has started to evolve the services it offers. This includes an initiative called ‘Time Shared’, a buddy system for individuals with common interests allowing them to socialise outside of the formal care environment \[ **E8**\]. The scheme has given service users *‘greater independence, freedom, happiness, and …it starts to portray a much more positive view of individuals and what they can achieve’* \[ **E8**\]. Working with Collin has encouraged *‘professionals working with them, and family members to …have greater aspirations and a stronger voice to say, actually, we would like a different range of support or we'd like a different range of opportunities’* \[ **E8**\]. 

 **4.4** **Contributing to repeal of the Sexual Offences Act 1993 \(Republic of Ireland\)** 

 Canadian public broadcaster CBC/Radio\-Canada noted how *‘movies can have big impacts on people's lives, but not many films can say they've actually changed the law. Enter* Sanctuary *…’* \[ **E3**, p7\]. Irish advocacy groups had been lobbying for a change to the Sexual Offences Act 1993 since its inception. The film adaptation of *Sanctuary* played a central role in bringing this issue to the attention of both the public and national legislators. At the 2017 screening at Dublin film festival, it was announced by Sarah Lennon, Inclusion Ireland CEO, that thanks to the popular and critical success of the film, Section 5 of the Criminal Law Act 1993 had been repealed in the Oireachtas \(Irish Parliament\). She explained why the film was of such crucial importance, ‘ *the real difficulty we faced was getting people to connect and really understand what impact the law was having …*Sanctuary *really did open up that storytelling door to us and to other campaigners at that time’* \[ **E9**, p1\]. 

 In galvanising the campaign for reform, *Sanctuary* helped to convince legislators to pass a new Bill in 2017, which no longer made it a criminal offence for consensual sexual relationships to take place between individuals who have an ID. This change benefited thousands of Irish citizens who would otherwise have been affected by the discriminatory law. Ireland’s Minister for Disabilities, Finian McGrath who oversaw the passage of legislation through the parliament, confirmed that *Sanctuary* has *‘led to a quiet revolution in relation to the sexuality of people with physical and intellectual disabilities’* \[ **E10**, p1\]. Inclusion Ireland confirm that there are now positive examples of the law bringing benefits to families across the country, ‘ *there was a lack of confidence or comfort with the idea of* \[family members with an ID\] *having intimate relationships or sexual relationships …this film has helped break down a lot of those barriers*’ \[ **E9**, p2\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Vecchiato‘s research explored the implementation of Technology Roadmapping \(TRM\), a structured approach to identifying technological solutions needed to develop a product, in turbulent business environments. This research was taken up by R&D managers at global tyre manufacturer Pirelli, who: 

-  reviewed current processes and implemented innovative TRM practices at their company, increasing effective collaboration between different departments 

-  carried out and completed 10 TRM exercises, involving the direct participation of 96 R&D and product managers, and affecting 286 R&D projects 

-  stimulated new product development of 76 tyres, shortening time to market and maximising both usage and crossover of Pirelli’s technological innovations 

-  facilitated entry into a new market \(bicycle tyres\) with the P Zero Velos tyres 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Despite growing investments in R&D and innovation, only a few companies manage to develop and launch new products that are successful: most companies experience high failure rates. 

 Since 2014, Vecchiato has led research focused on the best practice for innovation in fast\-paced, turbulent, uncertain environments. Vecchiato advocates for the use of product and technology roadmapping \(TRM\) as a managerial foresight technique in these turbulent business environments. A technology roadmap is a graphical representation of the coevolution over the course of time of technologies, products and markets in the form of a time\-based chart, comprising a number of layers; these typically include both commercial and technological perspectives. A TRM involves a series of meetings and workshops that bring together managers and researchers from different organisational units to identify the key features of new technologies and products. Firms can use TRM in each stage of their innovation process for gathering and analysing, in a systematic way, knowledge about new technologies and customer needs. 

 Vecchiato’s work has established the conceptual foundations, and an evidence base, for such an approach by examining the foresight practices that sustain innovation and development even in uncertainty. Using a case study methodology, he explored how two large companies coped with major changes and uncertainty in their industries **\[R1\]**. The research focused on how strategic planning can help decision makers cope with change, and on where more flexible approaches are more successful. He identified different kinds of uncertainty and the most relevant drivers of change for each company. A key finding was that firms only started using foresight techniques, like roadmaps, when decision makers had a sound grasp of all the components of their industry. Knowing the full boundaries of the business allowed decision makers to identify targets and risks for future growth, even in the known uncertainty of continuous change. Additional work by Vecchiato, using a multiple\-case research design, has explored the role of managerial cognition in rival businesses’ marketing competence **\[R2\]**. 

 Further research explored the relationship between corporate foresight and strategic agility. Using empirical findings, Vecchiato found that organisations need to articulate, share and combine knowledge to sustain a completive edge **\[R3\]**. This on\-going learning maximises the use of present internal knowledge, and results in the continuous updating of future strategy. Research exploring how to enhance the learning benefits of foresight practices **\[R4\]** developed a planning methodology which was embedded into a biotech company’s R&D investment decisions. Combining real options valuation with scenario planning, Vecchiato proposed an innovative model which offered evaluation of long\-term profits with timely decision making. 

 An in\-depth, longitudinal case study **\[R5\]** investigated the contributions of both cognitive dynamics and strategic decisions to business success in changing, turbulent environments. Vecchiato examined how foresight techniques can inform managerial beliefs, and thus contribute to the learning and the reactive decision making of managers. His findings showed that even though some major events had not been predicted through scenario planning, the planning process had enabled the company and its managers to adapt well to the unpredicted events. From these insights, he produced a conceptual framework illustrating the relationships between scenario planning, cognitive dynamics, and strategic decisions. His research has shown how companies can use TRM for systematically elaborating, in each stage of the innovation process, and how to identify the formal deliverables that support the decision regarding whether to move to the next stage of the roadmap. 

 
As a result of this work, his insights were sought by members of the R&D team at Pirelli, the multinational tyre manufacturer. The figure below \(from **\[S3\]**\) shows an example of a TRM project for Pirelli’s motorcycle business unit. This has resulted in their implementation of a framework inspired and directed by his research.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Vecchiato’s research on Technology roadmapping \(TRM\) has increased both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the innovation process at Pirelli, the multinational tyre manufacturer. 

 <ins>Introduction of TRM to Pirelli</ins> 

 Since the early 2010s, the growing complexity and changes in the tyre industry have resulted in Pirelli needing to revise their product development process: specifically, how knowledge was transferred from their research centres to their product divisions. Facing this challenge, in 2014, senior R&D managers of Pirelli reached out to and started to collaborate with Vecchiato, being familiar with his work at Milan in the early 2010s. A conference paper authored by three senior R&D managers at Pirelli explicitly mentions the work of Vecchiato as a key influence ton their decision to adopt TRM and the bespoke way they designed and implemented it **\[S1\]**, which led to the generation of ‘ *a new set of organizational capabilities*’ **\[S2\]**. 

 Application of the findings from the TRM research had the following foundational impacts: 

-  Contributing to Pirelli’s managers understanding of TRM and to their eventual decision to introduce TRM in their own company. 

-  Guiding Pirelli’s R&D managers to seamlessly integrate TRM into their overall innovation process, so that they could better face the growing turbulence of their business environment. 

-  Underpinning Pirelli’s design and implementation of an innovative approach to TRM, bespoke to the specific needs of this company. 

-  One of Pirelli’s R&D managers stated that the ‘ *research of Dr Vecchiato contributed to changing our process of new product development and enhancing the effectiveness of this process*’. He also explained how the research ‘ *affected in particular the way we gather information about the evolution of new technologies and markets, we analyse this information, and elaborate the deliverables that guide the decision to move from one stage of our new product development process to the next*’ **\[S2\]**. 

 <ins>Implementation of TRM at Pirelli</ins>TRM is critical to the stages of Pirelli’s innovation process, from initial idea generation to the final post\-launch review. With more than 1,800 R&D and innovation managers, the implementation of TRM has directly impacted many stakeholders at Pirelli **\[S3\]**. The key changes resulting from Vecchiato’s research include **\[S2\]**: 

-  The redesign of information gathering: from an informal and unstructured process to a formal, methodical process. This improves access to the existing pool of knowledge available within the whole company and grows knowledge collection. 

-  The redesign of information analysis: from an unstructured process with limited dialogue and knowledge sharing to a continuous, systematic process that expands the initial set of data available in the company and improves the understanding of these data. 

-  The redesign of elaboration of deliverables: from an unstructured process with limited integration of expertise among specialists and managers to a methodical process where managers’ assumptions about future products and markets are explicit and shareable. 

 Research by Vecchiato contributed to the decision of Pirelli’s R&D managers to create a database, the iMiner, which would provide a complete repository of the company’s R&D and innovation knowledge. This common\-language, shared information repository supported the implementation of TRM by uniting workshop and meeting participants from different business units and geographic locations, such as: researchers, technologists, marketing managers, strategic planners and product specialists, enabling them to better share knowledge.As a result, Pirelli has increased the number of new products it develops, has accelerated the time\-to\-market, and increased the exploitation of technological synergies between different product platforms. In the last two years \(March 2018 – March 2020\), 10 TRM exercise were completed within the company, involving 96 R&D and product managers \- benefitting 286 R&D projects and the development of 76 new tyres. In the same period, 273 R&D and innovation managers directly accessed the iMiner at least once; and the database was accessed a total of 84,038 times **\[S4\]**. 

 <ins>TRM and New Product Development: the example of the P Zero Velos</ins> The most significant new product guided to market by the TRM was Pirelli’s P Zero Velos. These were also Pirelli’s entry into the bicycle tyre market **\[S5\]**. A co\-authored review remarks ‘A *major outcome of the MOTO tires technology\-product roadmap was the development of a new product, that is, the P ZERO™ Velo, the commercialization of which officially started in September 2017. TRM helped Pirelli’s managers seize the opportunity to enter this growing market by exploiting some of the technological and brand skills that the company had already developed in its existing businesses’* **\[S3\]**. At a TRM workshop, participants identified the product features and the technologies that could be easily transferred from the car and motorcycle product platforms, such as the patented, all\-weather SmartNET™ Silica compound. TRM accelerated the development and commercialization to just 15 months, compared to the average 24 months. Cycling Weekly summarised how ‘ *Pirelli has bundled up a collection of its most confidence inspiring, automotive knowledge, and filtered it all into a tyre for road cyclists*’ **\[S6\]**. The Mitchelton\-Scott team raced with these tyres in the 2018 Tour de France; the tyres are available for public purchase, at around £30.00 per tyre. 

 <ins>Integration of TRM into Pirelli’s Innovation Strategy</ins> 

 The role of TRM in the overall innovation process of Pirelli has been integrated in the strategic objectives of enhancing cost competitiveness and fostering technological competitiveness. A presentation at the 2019 STIM Consortium illustrates product innovation at Pirelli, by emphasizing the role of TRM as one of the ‘key enabling factors’ in the overall innovation efforts of the company **\[S7\]**. The 2020\-2022 Industrial Plan highlights the innovation and technology development strategy of the company for the next three years and explicitly mentions TRM and its role in designing the overall product roadmap of the company **\[S8\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Using films, broadcast media, analytical and autobiographical essays, and oral history, this case study has achieved three impacts through: 

 **1.** Improved public understanding in Ireland and Britain of the historical relationship – and interdependency – between the Irish and British during the twentieth century. 

 **2.** Facilitating critical self\-reflection by authors and audience about identities and community within the first and second\-generation Irish diaspora. 

 **3.** Using a collage of individual stories and experiences to improve public understanding of Irish diasporic communities. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This impact case study on UK Irish diasporas is informed by research publications and award\-winning original creative outputs. It demonstrates how blending fact and fiction with personal experience provides effective opportunities for analysing, shaping and re\-affirming Irish identities, both at home and abroad. The aim of this research is to capture a wider range of Irish diasporic experiences by re\-discovering forgotten stories and providing new perspectives, such as those of second\-generation women and social media users. Irish immigration was driven by economic hardship at home and the opportunities available elsewhere, such as the pull of the post\-World War 2 British economy, which had skills and labour shortages. Chain migration and established local communities in the host countries offered new, lasting relationships and collective resources to help emigrants establish roots and maintain connections to Irish culture and heritage. 

 McCrory and McMahon’s research explores the varied activities of Irish immigrants \(first and second\-generation\) over the past hundred and twenty\-years and their relationships with others including host communities. Their work brings these experiences to a much wider public audience, informing critical self\-perceptions of Irish identity in diasporic and home communities. The research aids the improvement of community relations by fostering respect, understanding and appreciation for the rich and diverse multicultural and multiethnic make\-up of UK society. The research demonstrates that Irish diasporic bodies are comprised of a collage of experiences of shared history that informs different perceptions of self. Diasporas do not consider the homeland as something insular and fixed, but fluid and open to interpretation, which this research demonstrates. 

 McMahon’s chapter \[3.1\] explores how Facebook serves as an effective medium for Irish expatriates to connect and engage in Irish history, heritage and culture. McMahon demonstrates how a Facebook page offers a valuable location for members of the Kerry diaspora to congregate, interact and reaffirm their identities. Informed by his acute understanding of radio audiences and the Kerry diaspora, which was formed during the process of investigating and writing\-up this research chapter \[3.1\], McMahon, himself an Irish emigrant, has sought to investigate Irish diasporic contributions and experiences more extensively. He has brought lesser\-known histories of Irish diasporic experiences to both a Kerry and wider international audiences through public broadcasts and audio dramas \(detailed in section 5\). He has also used a case study of Irish immigrants to Derby, England, during the 1950s and 1960s and public responses to his work through oral history projects and public exhibitions. 

 McCrory’s research aims to assist in the first time capture of the diverse experiences of the second\-generation Irish community in Britain, a group she contends have been largely rendered invisible, barely perceived, excluded and silenced. The research argues that second\-generation Irish actively retain their creativity and use it to maintain connections with home and to re\-affirm and shape their sense of identity. Through her groundbreaking co\-edited anthology \[3.2\] combining fiction, poetry and essays by emerging and established/acclaimed writers, McCrory argues and articulates that newer explorations for narrative merging fact and fiction provide valuable expressions of experience. The anthology proposes how imagination and embellishment in storytelling shape Irish diasporic perceptions of the past by challenging conceptions of authenticity and belonging. McCrory’s publication \[3.3\] investigates social attitudes to bereavement and grief relating to female public expression in Irish culture and diasporic communities. The essay examines attitudes towards behaviours of mourning in this demographic past and present, arguing that these have enabled the establishment of a female voice and presence that spans generations. 

 Together, McCrory and McMahon’s research reveals how original creative, artistic and literary contributions explore how obscured or half\-forgotten pasts can be re\-engaged to forge a new understanding of diasporic experiences historically, on the part of individuals within such communities and those beyond.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Pathways to impacts have included exhibitions, broadcasts, online disseminations and public lectures and readings. The beneficiaries are the multi\-generational general public who are members of, or who have links to, the Irish diaspora globally and in the UK. 

 **Audio Drama** 

 McMahon’s radio drama ‘William Melville: Eve of War’ demonstrates his perceptive understanding of unappreciated Irish diasporic histories as well as his developing expertise in the needs and expectations of Irish radio audiences \(in this sense, the audio drama both benefitted from and informed the research process and findings for 3.1\). The audio drama challenged common perceptions of Irish immigrants in Ireland, the UK and internationally. Melville \(1850\-1918\) was an Irish immigrant who had a major impact on British history, for example, by working in the secret service, but his activities were not properly detailed or recognised until this audio drama. The drama was first broadcast by Radio Kerry \(01\-01\-2016\), and after McMahon’s appointment at Derby, was published by his company Henchman Productions on Soundcloud in 2016 \(251 plays by 18\-12\-2020, see 5.1\) and re\-broadcast by Radio Kerry in 2017 \(07\-04\-2017, approximately 33,000 listeners per broadcast, see 5.2\). McMahon’s production also drew international attention to the history of Melville in September 2016, when it was nominated amongst the 231 qualifying entries from 35 countries in the prestigious Prix Europa. It was described by the judging panel as amongst the ‘best television, radio, and online productions’ which were ‘changing Europe’ \[5.4\]. In June 2016, Henchman Productions won a Silver Trophy for the drama at the esteemed New York Festivals International Radio Program Awards \[5.5\], which honors, *“the exceptional and innovative programs being created on all continents.”* The Grand Jury consisted of over 100 award\-winning programming executives who sought to *“determine the World’s Best Radio Programs”* \[sic\] with entries from over 30 countries and *“exceptionally strong competition”* \[5.5\]. 

 Radio Kerry supported, broadcast and rebroadcasted McMahon’s work on William Melville who had *“largely been forgotten”*, bringing it to a *“large audience”* \[5.2\]. The testimonial by the General Manager of Radio Kerry emphasised that the *“research was thorough and reliable”*, and McMahon employed his creative writing and radio production skills, *“to bring it to listeners in an engaging, entertaining and professional way”* \[5.2\]. Furthermore, McMahon’s oeuvre, *“played a huge role in informing and educating Kerry audiences”* about Melville and, *“the Irish diaspora in the UK and further afield”*, representing and reinforcing, *“a different aspect of Irish identity often not told”* \[5.2\]. The General Manager also confirmed that, *“Daithi’s work and the audience reaction to it directly led the station \[to\] continuing to support this type of content”*; citing the example of the ‘Footprints’ slot on their regular current affairs radio programme, *Kerry Today*. ‘Footprints’ features a historian from Kerry Library presenting lesser\-known historical stories from the Library’s archives and newspaper collections to the station’s audience, enhancing awareness of local heritage and identity \[5.2\]. 

 The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland \(BAI\), who commissioned and funded the Melville project, deemed the work *“highly relevant to the Radio Kerry audience”* noting it has, *“enhanced understanding of Irish/Kerry history, heritage and experience”* and helped the audience, *“appreciate the challenges, successes, and experiences of the Irish diaspora in the UK historically”*. The BAI further *“welcomed”* what it emphasised was an, *“historically accurate high quality radio drama”* \[5.3\]. 

 **Engaging with Oral Histories of Irish Immigrants** 

 The personal experiences of fourteen first generation Irish emigrants were captured in the 26 minute film *Our Story* \[5.7\] which was shared publicly online from 21 December 2020 as part of the *To Be Irish Festival* and the content remains available online. Up to 31 December 2020, the film received 65 views, however, up to 12 January 2021 it received a further 1,146 views. An online survey was conducted to measure the public impact of the film with nine respondents completing it up to 31 December 2020 from three countries \(5.9\). A total of 90 respondents from five countries participated in the survey up to 12 January 2021. Of the nine, who responded by 31 December 2020, 66% felt the film changed their understanding of Irish diaspora communities \(31% of the 90 respondents by 12 January 2021\). Comments from these 9 respondents included: *“It has drawn my attention to the existence of the Irish community in Derby which I was not aware of. I also have a better understanding of why and how they arrived in the UK”*. Another wrote: *“I wasn't aware that there was an Irish diaspora in Derby so this has made me aware”* and, *“The life that flourished abroad is not likely to have enjoyed similar richness had they stayed in Ireland”*. The experiences which the respondents believed they had learned most from the film were how senses of community and identity were formed and shaped and the role of host nation hospitality in these processes. A selection of responses included: *“For me, it was how these people embraced their new country whilst maintaining strong 'Irishness' in accent, outlook and traditions.”* Another wrote: *“Many spoke of the importance of having Irish communities around them…to provide sense of belonging and community”* \[5.9\]. The Department of Foreign Affairs commented that *Our Story* allows for the: *“development of new ways to communicate and connect with the increasingly diverse global Irish, including non\-traditional diasporas and young emigrants.”* It also encourages: *“intergenerational engagement*… \[which will\]… *ultimately celebrate, maintain and strengthen the links between Ireland and the Global Irish”*, fostering a *“more vibrant sense of community and of Irish identity”* and improving, *“awareness and understanding of the Irish emigrant and diaspora experience…*\[which\] *…can help promote better awareness of Irish life and culture, to inspire and engage the next generation of the diaspora for years to come”* \[5.8\]. 

 A 4\-minute version of *Our Story* was exhibited at *FORMAT 19: Forever/Now*, the 2019 biennial iteration of the *FORMAT* International Photography Festival which was delivered in partnership with the University of Derby \[5.6a, 5.6b\]. The festival was featured in *The* *Guardian*/ *Observer* \(17\-3\-2019\), the website reached some 14,000 unique users, had 2.3m Facebook engagements and over 180,000 Twitter impressions \[5.6c\]. Based on the success and positive reception of the 4\- minute piece \[5.6a\] the 26\-minute version of *Our Story* was produced \[5.7\]. 

 **Creative and Analytical Work** 

 The impact of McCrory’s chapter ‘Memory and authenticity’ and her co\-edited book \[3.2\] is evident in the Irish Literary Society’s comment that the work’s essays are: *“vital aids in thinking about how the tropes of diaspora narratives inform a sense of identity and the stories we tell of ourselves to each other and to others”* \[5.10b\]. Novelist and poet, Martina Evans in a review for the *Irish Times* noted that the book was *“exceptionally fine”*, *“\[e\]rudite, hilarious and heart\-breaking”*, *“packed with ... terrific characters and stories”*, *“powerful”* and *“harrowing”*, whilst McCrory’s chapter ‘Memory and authenticity’ was adjudged *“excellent”* \[5.10a\]. Evans also noted the importance of the book in promoting intercommunity understanding, further describing the collection as, *“…ground\-breaking and thought\-provoking… \[a\] vital contribution’ to Anglo\-Irish relations”* \[5.10a\]. Impact has also been generated by live public readings and launch events which took place at the Five Leaves Bookshop in Nottingham, England \(20\-6\-2019\); Irish Literary Society/Cumann Éireannach na liteardhachta \(30\-09\-2019\); The Leeds Literary Festival \(05\-03\-2020\); and a live streamed launch at QUAD Arts Centre, Derby \(08\-09\-2020\) which attracted an audience of 80.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Cambridge Archaeological Unit \(CAU\) bridges the research and commercial activities of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Cambridge. The impact of two long\-term, high\-profile projects is detailed here: Must Farm, where unparalleled Bronze Age archaeology has been revealed, and the West and North West Cambridge \(Eddington\) developments, which provide new windows onto our understanding of rural life in Roman Britain and \(by excavations at Cambridge Observatory\) the archaeology of astronomy. Through a strong programme of public engagement and innovative collaborations with a wide variety of stakeholders, these research projects have resulted in far\-reaching impacts on education, the arts, industry and development both in East Anglia and nationally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 CAU undertakes approximately 50 archaeological investigations annually and has been a key research arm of Cambridge’s Department of Archaeology for three decades. Its research strategy is led by Executive Director Evans, elected FBA in 2018 for his contributions to archaeology. It boasts a broad portfolio of high\-impact projects in eastern England. Two examples are singled out here: Must Farm \(building on research at neighbouring Bradley Fen\) in Whittlesey, near Peterborough, \[R1,R2\] and major interrelated developments in West and North West Cambridge \(known as Eddington\) \(e.g. \[R3,R4\]\). 

 At Must Farm, Knight directs CAU fieldwork in the quarries of Forterra Building Products Ltd. A key methodological innovation of Knight’s previous research at Bradley Fen was recognising that significant archaeology \(beyond ‘wet’ votive deposits\) existed within deeper peat and silt layers than was previously appreciated \[R2\]. This insight led to many subsequent discoveries at Must Farm. Palaeochannel investigations located nine exceptionally well\-preserved logboats, several hurdle\-built fish\-weirs, more than 20 fish\-traps and Bronze and Iron Age weaponry. Most spectacular was a Late Bronze Age settlement of wooden structures built over a slow\-flowing watercourse – the Must Farm pile\-dwelling settlement. In 2015 to 2016, CAU conducted meticulous excavations of the remains which, following a catastrophic fire, had collapsed into the stream. Waterlogged silts preserved structures, inorganic artefacts and delicate organics such as textiles and foodstuffs, providing a unique opportunity to reveal, in fine detail, life in Bronze Age Britain. In post\-excavation analysis, led by Knight and Ballantyne, CAU is now reconstructing a Late Bronze Age community at the individual household level, and exploring its inhabitants’ lifeways over its approximately one year of occupation \[R1\]. 

 CAU’s North West Cambridge \(Eddington\) Project, directed by Evans and Brittain \(e.g. \[R4\]\), entailed excavating six major Bronze Age to Roman sites between 2012 and 2019. This work built on excavations in West Cambridge led by Evans between 1994 and 2018 \[R3\]. Results of these interrelated projects were enhanced by advances in statistical sampling procedures and artefact density analyses developed by Evans \(e.g. \[R5\]\). With four farmsteads, a villa\-estate complex and a roadside centre excavated, this research represents one of the most comprehensive landscape investigations of a Romano\-British countryside. The research also contributes to the archaeology of astronomy, through excavations at the Cambridge Observatory, including the Newall telescope of 1891, for a time the most powerful instrument of its kind in the world. The Observatory was the site of much scientific research, including a meeting in 1930 between Einstein and renowned Cambridge astronomer Arthur Eddington \[R6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CAU’s impact is rooted in long\-term engagement with archaeological research and stakeholders in eastern England. Developing impact is a cornerstone of the Unit’s research strategy, with far\-reaching contributions to education, the arts, development and industry. Must Farm and Eddington provide important examples. 

 **1. Educational Pathways and Impacts \(Must Farm\)** 

 Investigations at Must Farm in 2015 to 2016 were promoted proactively, capturing extensive press attention: television \(e.g. BBC, ITV, CNN\), documentaries \(e.g. BBC4, PBS\), radio \(e.g. BBC R4\) and print \(e.g. *Guardian*, *New York Times*, *Washington Post*\) \[E1\]. The project adopted an active social media policy \[E2,E3\]. As of July 2020, its Facebook page had 22,971 followers and a total post reach of 4,563,976. Its Twitter account had 6,792 followers and its content made 3,938,979 Impressions. Seven post\-excavation videos about Must Farm’s textiles have been viewed 101,662 times and attracted almost 500 comments \[E3\]. Must Farm’s social media impact is indicated by strong viewer engagement. The number of engaged Facebook users \(who interacted with page content\) was 381,292 between September 2015 and July 2020. Evaluation of 4,361 comments on Facebook posts between October 2015 and August 2016 indicates that the project inspired archaeological thinking among the general public, with followers asking informed questions and suggesting interpretations \(e.g. regarding the function of artefacts\) \[E2\]. 

 CAU’s engagement with Peterborough Museum, where the site archive will be deposited, has had important educational impacts. A Must Farm exhibition \(May to September 2017\) attracted 27,884 visitors, ‘ *by far the highest average number of visitors per month*’ among the museum’s temporary exhibitions \[E4\]. Evaluation\-form feedback shows that visitors left informed about archaeological finds from the local area. Thanks to connections made while engaging with Cambridge University, this local museum is now supported nationally through partnerships with the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, leading to the development of major exhibitions such as *Treasures* \(25 August 2018 to 6 January 2019\) \[E4\]. Moreover, as a result of working on Must Farm materials, museum staff across all areas have undertaken professional skills development, resulting in workforce upskilling \[E4\]. 

 CAU’s research and impact activities have embedded knowledge of Must Farm and archaeology nationally; evidence ranges from political caricature to the site being named by Historic England \(HE\) as one of the top 10 archaeological discoveries of the decade \(Figure 1\) \[E1\]. Moreover, Must Farm is now included in HE’s national curriculum teaching provision, with an online education pack for Key Stage 2 \[E5\] and a recommendation for its inclusion in Key Stage 4 \(GCSE\) Biology and Combined Science \[E6\].

Left: The Daily Telegraph \(13 January 2016\) deploys it to portray Jeremy Corbyn as a voice from the past \[E1\]; Right: CAU staff pictured in coverage of Historic England’s top 10 finds of the decade \(BBC News, 28 December 2019\) \[E1\]. 

 The project’s impact is widely recognised. In 2016, Must Farm was awarded Best Archaeological Discovery at the British Archaeological Awards. In 2017, it was named Rescue Project of the Year, and Mark Knight Archaeologist of the Year, by *Current Archaeology*, a popular magazine with 45,000 readers \[E1\]. In May 2020, a project publication \[R1\] received the Antiquity prize \[E1\]. 

 **2. Contributions to the Arts \(Must Farm and Eddington\)** 

 Must Farm and Eddington generated new artistic outputs, directions and career opportunities for artists. With CAU collaboration, artist Laura Wilson ‘ *developed new artworks on a far more ambitious scale than I have ever attempted before*’ \[E7\]. In 2017, she collaborated with CAU in an Arts Council\-funded project having Must Farm as focus. Wilson received GBP25,000 towards the performance piece and film *Deepening*, performed at the Must Farm quarry and shown at Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery \(from 18th January 2020 until COVID lockdown\). ‘ *Working with CAU, hearing about and experiencing their research firsthand, has changed the way in which I think about landscapes ... \[and\] pushed my work in new directions which I could not have imagined two years ago*’ \[E7\]. Collaboration on *Deepening* ‘ *led to new professional opportunities*’ \[E7\], including commissions for the Usher Gallery and The Collection \(Lincoln\). 

 The arts practice *Somewhere* were artists in residence with CAU at the Eddington development \(May 2013 to April 2014\). Work with CAU was a ‘ *very positive collaboration and experience*’ resulting in a public art project at Eddington ‘ *engaging with the transient nature of the site and this fleeting, unique archaeological access to the past*’ \[E8\]. In May and June of 2014, with 60 volunteers, they created an on\-site 12.5 scale cob model of the development \(Figure 2\). Volunteers included individuals supported by Inclusion Drug and Alcohol Service, Riverside English Churches Housing Group and Cambridge City Council Streetchamps. All responded that the experience was overwhelmingly positive \(e.g. ‘ *life changing for me*’\) \[E8\]. 

 Since February 2014, *Somewhere* have run a follow\-on project, Prospection, documenting ‘ *the evolution of the new Eddington community*’; it creates an annual ‘finds box’ of records, deposited with Cambridgeshire Archives \[E8\]. In September 2014, Kettle’s Yard Gallery invited a major *Somewhere* exhibition, including work with CAU. Inspired by their archaeological experiences, the artists have since collaborated with the British Museum on its project ResearchSpace and created new artworks by distilling soil samples – leading to a touring show for the UN Year of Soil and artistic fellowships with the National Trust and UCL \[E8\].

 **3. Contributions to Development and Industry \(Must Farm and Eddington\)** 

 In January 2020, a masterplan for Whittlesey’s development was released by Fenland District Council and Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority. Must Farm is recognised as ‘ *a precious town asset*’ and ‘ *a majority of people felt that Bronze Age heritage should be promoted as a tourist attraction*’ \[E9\]. Of the masterplan’s eight recommendations, two are for a new heritage centre and a heritage walk. Following approval of the Market Towns Programme Investment Prospectus in June 2020, Whittlesey is now invited to bid for funding from the Combined Authority for these initiatives \[E9\]. 

 CAU’s work with Forterra at Must Farm has led to changes in quarrying. With 2000 staff at 24 sites, Forterra is among the UK’s largest heavy buildings products manufacturers. The Head of Land & Mineral Resources \[E10\] notes that it now acts with ‘ *enhanced awareness and foresight during our quarrying*’, recognising ‘ *the enormous potential of this archaeological resource*’. Further, ‘ *CAU’s inclusion of “outreach” … and wider community involvement via social media, as part of the research design, has provided Forterra with an improved insight into the interest and importance of local history to the communities in which it is found*’, causing a ‘ *change of perspective in our organization*’. Forterra is ‘ *now much more aware of the potential of archaeology in helping us be a “good neighbour’’ to the communities in which we operate*’. 

 At Eddington, CAU’s research ‘ *informed and inspired*’ the new 150 hectare sustainable community of 3,000 homes, accommodation for 2,000 students, a school, a community centre, shops, a care village and sports facilities; ‘ *knowledge of the underlying archaeology supplied by CAU has been used to inform aspects of the built form and layout on the site*’, such as with the Roman villa, the incorporation of which is being planned \[E11\]. ‘ *Moreover, CAU’s outreach work … has been an important mechanism for community engagement with the whole project*’. Drawing on the Unit’s research on the Cambridge Observatory, ‘ *even the name of the new community, Eddington, was suggested by Christopher Evans*’ \[E11\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hills and colleagues’ research on mixed football has led to 5 changes in National policy, increasing the age limit at which boys and girls can play together from Under 11 \(U11\) to Under 18 \(U18\). During the research over 200,000 young people either played on or were involved in competitions with mixed teams. Young people benefitted from opportunities for physical and social development, enjoyment, developing and maintaining cross\-gender friendships, as well as learning to challenge gender stereotypes and inequalities. The benefits can extend to young people more broadly and in 2019\-20, 1,015,800 or 33% of 11–16\-year\-olds in England participated in football \(E3\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Background</ins>: 

 Until 2011, the English Football Association \(EFA\) banned girls and boys from playing competitive football on the same team beyond the age of 10. Pressure to review the age limit was initiated through a recommendation from a Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee and pressure from local clubs. This included a highly publicised meeting between the Chief Executive of the EFA, the Sports Minister, Tessa Jowell and ten\-year\-old Minnie Cruttwell who was protesting her removal from her U12 boys’ team. EFA consultation activities illustrated there was no available research or consistency in policy that could inform their decision. Subsequently, in 2008, the EFA commissioned Dr Laura Hills and colleagues to evaluate U12\-U14 trials of mixed gender football. In 2009, Hills’ team established that the trials were a success and recommended an increase of the age limit to U14. Although this policy change was approved at all levels of the EFA, the shareholders resisted with an unanticipated veto. Ultimately, the recommendations of Hills et al. led to raising of the age limit to U13 in 2011, and U14 in 2012. 

 The research for the FA was underpinned by Hills’ research on gender, increasing opportunities for girls and women in sport, and physical education. Her work analyses assumptions made about gender differences in the context of sport, the prevalence of hegemonic interpretations of sporting masculinity, and the potential value of mixed sport environments \(Ref 1, Ref 2\). Hills and colleagues’ \(Dr Amanda Croston, Dr Alison Maitland, Ms Sara Horne\) research with the FA is unique in establishing a rationale for policy change in mixed football \(Ref 3\). 

 <ins>R</ins><ins>esearch projects</ins> <ins>funded by the EFA</ins> 

 The research for this project was conducted in seven funded projects \(total of GBP198,000\) from 2008 to 2019, which led to a series of changes in the EFA’s policy on U12 to U18 mixed football. 

 The initial two projects in 2008 and 2009 \(Ref 4\) employed qualitative methods to investigate pilots of mixed football from U12 to U14. Five teams were used as case studies involving in\-depth interviews with 37 stakeholders \(players, coaches, parents, and officials\), focus groups with male players, and survey data from 59 stakeholders. This research found that girls benefitted from opportunities for skill development, challenge, and enjoyment. Both boys and girls were shown to benefit socially from the friendships they developed and gained respect for each other as teammates. 

 Subsequently, the research expanded to include annual risk assessments of mixed football involving mixed teams and control groups as well as interview data \(at U14, U15, U16 and U18\), which led to further policy changes \(Ref 5\) and subsequent reports that corroborated the findings \(Ref 6\). This involved cross\-disciplinary research with two colleagues from Biomechanics with expertise in performance analysis and injury in sport \(Professor Bill Baltzopoulos and Ms Sara Horne\). This research has contributed to policy change through an interdisciplinary analysis of the value, risks, and challenges associated with mixed football. The Brunel reports have shown that girls are not at increased risk of injury when playing on mixed teams and they have the necessary skills and technical knowledge. Theoretically, these changes were linked to challenging gender inequalities by shifting understandings of the capabilities of girls and relationships between boys and girls. Hills and colleagues were commissioned by the EFA to conduct research on a pilot of adult mixed recreational football and futsal and to advise on the potential for policy change at this level \(Ref 7\). This research was interrupted by the cessation of football because of the pandemic and further work has been agreed for ‘post\-COVID’ \(E1\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 During the research, 3,359 girls played in boys’ leagues and 32 boys played in girls’ leagues. A conservative estimate of 33,590 young people played on a mixed team and over 200,000 young people either played on or were involved in competitions with mixed teams \(Ref 4 – Ref 6\). 

 <ins>England – Policy change in Mixed Gender Football</ins> 

 The English FA responded to Hills and colleagues’ research by increasing the age limit year on year – to under 13 in 2011, then 14 in 2012, 15 in 2013, 16 in 2014, and finally 18 in 2015. The change in 2015 means that the English FA abolished the age limit, allowing boys and girls to play together in youth football. The policy is progressive and unique, in that it allows girls to play in boys’ leagues and boys to play in girls’ leagues. The current policy states: ‘A child in the age ranges Under 7 to Under 18 inclusive may play in a match involving boys and girls.’ \(E4\) 

 The National Women’s Football Development Manager acknowledged the impact of Hills’ research: “The project has had a massive effect on the way our sport is played in this country. It wasn’t that long ago that girls could not play with boys over the age of 11, and now we are seeing girls have a choice to play up to 18. This has helped players develop in both our grassroots and talent programmes, way beyond our expectations.” \(E1\) 

 The success of the policy change was demonstrated by SB Frankfort U12 Girls Football, which was undefeated in both their league, Devon Junior and Mini League, and the Argus Cup, having competed against boys’ only teams all season. \(E5\) 

 <ins>Impact on the Women’s game</ins> 

 The impact of Dr Hills’ research has been significant and contributed to the growth of women’s football in England, the success of the National team, the development of individual players throughout the country, and increasing positive respect and support for women footballers.  In her book *Playing with the Boys* which focuses on the challenges of trying to be allowed to play on boys’ football teams, Niamh McKevitt, the first ever girl in England to play mixed football through to under 16, acknowledged the contribution of Hills’ research in “promoting mixed football and allowing me to play.” \(E6 p7\) Describing her experience of participating in Hills’ research, she said that, “It was so good to meet someone in a position of authority who was entirely positive about mixed football. I felt that I was finally able to get my views across and that Dr Hills was genuinely interested in what I had to say.” \(E6 p204\) UEFA player of the year in 2019 and FIFA player of the year in 2020, England footballer Lucy Bronze related the importance of mixed football in her development as a footballer, as well as its contribution to establishing friendships between boys and girls, an important finding of Hills' research. She stated that she was devastated when she was banned from playing with boys at the age of 12. “It wasn’t about being told I had to play down in Blyth, Newcastle or Sunderland, which is about an hour away from Alnwick, it was the fact my mum had to take me away from my friends. That killed me at the time. I’d spent my childhood playing football with my friends.” \(E7\) 

 <ins>Informing the</ins> <ins>international game</ins> 

 In 2017, UEFA requested a summary of Hills’ findings on mixed football that could be distributed to member countries. The review \(E2\) was completed with the National Women's Football Development Manager for the English FA and submitted to UEFA. 

 <ins>Change in adult mixed football</ins> 

 Hills and colleagues were asked to observe the 2019 Soccer Aid match as part of their research into adult mixed football. The adult mixed game was given a boost by the match, as women were included in the well\-publicized charity event for the first time. The match had a national reach, being broadcast live on ITV to a peak television audience of 5,700,000 viewers \(E8\) and a stadium crowd of 40,000. 4 

 English and Brazilian veteran women players were among the football legends and celebrities participating in a game that raised over GBP6,700,000 on the night for UNICEF’s *Defending Play campaign.* 

 <ins>Social Change</ins> 

 In addition to the policy change, the research is associated with broader social changes in attitudes towards girls and sport, equitable practices, and relationships between boys and girls. For example, one father of a female player stated, “Playing on a girls’ team would involve ‘dropping standards’…it would also mean that that she leaves behind her peer group, her own friendship group, which is critical to her developing as a person.” The latter is unique in sport nationally and internationally. The change in policy has resulted in an increased acceptance of mixed football for young people. One U18 coach involved in the research stated, “I’m tending to see now that every local junior football team has girls in mixed teams, I think it’s becoming more popular so it’s just another player now.” In addition, it has influenced the FA’s transgender policy, as young people no longer need to identify their gender to play football. \(E9\)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This research informed prescribing\-practice for healthcare organisations internationally so increasing the accessibility and safety of medicines particularly to targeted populations. It led to the pan\-European €1.02 million EU funded SIMPATHY project which has shaped polypharmacy management strategies globally. A health economic tool from this shows polypharmacy management prevents the prescribing of over 120,000 inappropriate medications each year in Scotland alone, with significant costs savings and reduction in adverse effects. This research has driven changes to policy and NHS contracted services leading to education of 1000s of Pharmacist Independent Prescribers, who make significant impact in the delivery of high\-quality patient care.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Poor medication practice causes human harm, and globally costs US$42 billion annually. The World Health Organisation \(WHO\) pledged to cut severe avoidable harm by half by 2022. This work informs service improvements that increases the accessibility and safety of medicines by focussing on non\-medical prescribing, particularly by pharmacists, within the general and targeted populations, including older people with multimorbidity. 

 Since 2004, this research engaged international collaborators with multi\-professional input. Initial research identified positive experiences with the pharmacist prescribing education programmes, highlighting a strong need for pharmacist prescribing implementation, with positive views of pre\-implementation, as well as concerns from a range of policymakers, clinicians, and patient stakeholders. Research advanced to consider the progression of prescriber education into practice and encompassed the perspectives of the public, patients, pharmacist prescribers, non\-prescribing pharmacists, student pharmacists, and the wider care team. This work was used nationally and internationally by regulators and professional bodies to set standards that covered practice across the whole of the UK. 

 The work progressed to encompass an array of approaches, including evidence\-syntheses and primary research studies in the UK and internationally. The aim was to develop a multi\-perspective international evidence\-base for the benefit of non\-medical prescribing in terms of medication use that is safe and effective for patients. 

 A Cochrane Review, which involved collating evidence of clinical, patient‐reported, and resource use outcomes of non‐medical prescribing for managing acute and chronic health conditions in primary and secondary care settings as compared with medical prescribing. The findings suggested that non‐medical prescribers were as effective as usual care and deliver comparable outcomes \[1\].  Further reviews considered current policies and guidelines for polypharmacy management in older people \[2\] that also focussed on the views and experiences of stakeholders around pharmacist prescribing and the perceived facilitators and barriers to global implementation \[3\]. Over 30 papers have been published and the work widely disseminated, including invited presentations at international conferences. 

  

 Global issues required consideration of international dimensions. The Middle East \(ME\) was chosen to explore the transferability of evidence to international contexts. Evidence synthesis of poor prescribing practice in the ME led to success in obtaining US$600,000 of funding from the Qatar National Research Fund to quantify and characterise issues around medication errors \[4\]. Parallel research involving high\-level decision\-makers in Qatar showed support for the implementation of pharmacist prescribing \[5\]. The findings were largely positive, highlighting the potential for translation and adaptation of educational and care models to suit international contexts. Ongoing collaboration with the Qatar Supreme Council for Health is defining the education program, licensing credentials, and models of care to make Qatar the lead implementor of pharmacist prescribing in the ME. 

 This international work led to team members developing a €1.02 million collaborative project funded by the European Commission. This investigated best practice in prescribing and managing medicines in older, multimorbid people. Data collection spanned all EU states culminating in several publications \[6\] and the launch of a reference text for improving prescribing and career progression routes for pharmacist prescribers across Europe.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins>National Impact on Population Health</ins> 

 A pan\-European EU\-funded research project \(SIMPATHY\) investigated best practice in prescribing in older, multimorbid people. Part of this work evaluated the Scottish Polypharmacy Guidance document, partly based on our research, as the best in Europe \[C1\]. This implemented a comprehensive strategy for polypharmacy management in Scotland with significant economic saving and reduction in harm. An article from 2019 highlights that, as a result of this work in Scotland, more than 120,000 inappropriate medications are being stopped each year saving money and reducing patient harm \[C2\]. Pharmacist prescribers play a significant role in this. 

 In Scotland pharmacist prescribing developed from the national Pharmacy Strategy document ‘Achieving Excellence in Pharmaceutical Care’. This document stated a commitment that all patient\-facing pharmacists are independent prescribing \(IP\). More recently our research informed the contracting of a new service in Community Pharmacy – NHS Pharmacy First Plus where IP pharmacists prescribe medicines, usually only available from a GP appointment, for common clinical conditions \[C3\]. This is impacting significantly by reducing GP workload and enhancing accessibility of patient to services and medicines. 

 The NHS Education for Scotland \(NES\) website \[C4\] evidences the value and impact of our research in informing and progressing Scottish National Pharmacist education and so making a significant contribution to this national strategy. 

 Through the research work a postgraduate course in pharmacist IP has been developed. In August 2019, the maximum period of accreditation for the IP course was secured \[C5\]. The GPhC confirmed that the course can be delivered to 200 students annually. RGU is one of only a few institutions with such a high intake. This attracts funding from NES in excess of £200,000 annually and means that the School has generated more than 1,500 professionally prescribing pharmacists over the last 10 years. This has resulted in significant impact to patient care through these IP\-qualified pharmacists contributing to prescribing practice \[C4\] 

 The programme of work also led to a collaborative commission with Strathclyde University by the Scottish Government to deliver on a £400,000 study exploring pharmacy workforce issues and their contribution to General Practice workflows \[C6\]. A focus of this research was on the models of practice and capacity of pharmacist prescribers in the general practice setting. It showed that more than 70% were IP qualified with intentions to use this in their practice. 

 <ins>Impact on International Healthcare</ins> 

 Evidence of the impact of this work internationally in relation to prescribing in targeted populations comes from the EU\-funded SIMPATHY project. Its aim was to stimulate, promote and support the development of innovations across the EU in both the management of polypharmacy and adherence in the elderly in order to deliver efficient and sustainable healthcare systems. Team members made significant contributions to the eight\-country collaboration, and a key output from this was a polypharmacy international handbook titled ‘Polypharmacy Management by 2030: A Patient Safety Challenge’ \[C7\], which was launched at the European Parliament and has been adopted across Europe and globally to inform and direct organisational policy around polypharmacy management. 

 Evidence of the impact of this international handbook on Scottish policy is shown by reference to it in the Scottish National Polypharmacy Guidance \[C1\]. In 2017, this work was publicly commended by MSP Shona Robson, Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, at a European conference, noting that the work would influence change in polypharmacy and lead to new strategies for the safer, more effective use of medicines for multimorbidity in ageing \[C8\]. 

 Moreover, outcomes from the SIMPATHY project were integrated into the global launch \[C9\] of the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) Third Global Patient Safety Challenge \- Medication Without Harm and within a linked publication \[C10\]. The WHO have also used this work in a globally significant publication ‘Medication Safety in Polypharmacy’. In this, there is inclusion of the Scottish Polypharmacy Guidance \[C1\] and exemplar ‘case study’ materials developed from the SIMPATHY work. 

 This programme of work has extended its reach to cover populations beyond the elderly through a subsequent €3.5m EU funded three\-year project \(2019 to 2022\) entitled ‘iSIMPATHY’. Project partners include the Scottish Government/NHS Scotland, Northern Health & Social Care Trust / Medicines Optimisation Centre in Northern Ireland, and the Health Service Executive in the Republic of Ireland. 

  

 It is likely that iSIMPATHY will lead further national collaborations and make a significant contribution towards consolidating a single approach for polypharmacy management and  multi\-national compliance to the philosophy and practice of this to the benefit of patients and health services.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research in radiochemistry and biomolecular processes from the Chemistry Department at Hull has developed advances in molecular imaging science that have substantially improved diagnostic scanning capabilities for patients. Through a unique partnership with a local charity \(Daisy Appeal\) and Hull University Teaching Hospitals \(HUTH\) NHS Trust, this consortium has attracted >£15 million investment to build a bespoke centre where research and clinical services are integrated. The research has impacted upon the health of patients by providing much\-improved infrastructure for cancer diagnosis \(>12,500 patients scanned in the unit, equating to a 3\-fold increase in patient numbers\). The research and business communities have benefited with specialist training \(of >80 research and healthcare professionals, see 4.4\) and intellectual property \(see 3\). 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Chemistry research underpinned the partnership between The University of Hull \(UoH\) and Daisy Appeal that built a £3.5 million radiochemistry research centre \(on UoH campus, completed 2014\), a £2.5 million clinical scanning centre \(HUTH, completed 2014\) and a £9.5 million Molecular\-Imaging Research facility \(HUTH, completed 2021\). The Positron Emission Tomography \(PET\) research group at UoH has conducted radiochemistry research since 2004. It develops microfluidic methods for radiopharmaceutical synthesis, nanoparticles for theranostics and new radiometal chelators.<sup>1</sup> Currently 40 researchers and postgraduate students are involved in this research across the University and NHS. The key research activities underpinning this impact have been: optimising radioactive tracer synthesis \(2.1\), delivering dose\-on\-demand imaging drugs using compact cyclotrons \(2.2\), miniaturised radiodetector technology \(2.3\) and managing the successful implementation of interdisciplinary projects linking chemistry research to clinical developments that improve NHS practice \(2.4\). 

 **2.1  Optimised clinical radiotracer isotope production** 

 UoH research pioneered the use of flow synthesis radiochemistry labelling processes with microfluidic chips \(bespoke and fabricated in house\) or capillary reactors to optimise isotope\-processing technologies by the highly efficient removal of metal ion contaminants.<sup>2</sup> These chemical reactions are performed in yields that are comparable to leading clinical standards. They have been achieved with faster turnaround rates and greater potential for scalability to improve availability and supply to patients, to allow improved access to the best standard of diagnostic care.<sup>3</sup> Two patents were granted on this technology that, alongside  other patents \(see below\), underpinned a current Medical Research Council Developmental Pathway Funding Scheme \(MRC DPFS\) project to translate this method to clinical good manufacturing practice \(GMP\) standards with an aim of commercialisation through a new spinout company in 2022 on completion of the MRC project. 

 **2.2  Developing dose on demand for next generation PET radiopharmacy** 

 The new radiosynthesis processes developed at the UoH form an integrated production technology that minimises operator input and de\-skills production through automation. This has lower infrastructure requirements and reduces production cost by >30%. Synthesis of radiotracers had been demonstrated in microfluidic flow systems previously but the essential analytical chemistry for quality control \(QC\) testing was largely ignored by other researchers. The Hull team has developed an integrated microfluidic QC platform, compatible with compact cyclotrons, for the rapid, low volume \(10\-100 µL\) QC of radiotracers that tackles one of the biggest regulatory challenges to widespread use of this technology.<sup>4</sup> In the devices and processes developed at UoH, QC was fully integrated to ensure that the regulatory compliance needed in tracer production for patient administration was achieved.<sup>5</sup> Three patents have been granted, with one application pending \(see above for the commercialisation plan\). 

 **2.3: Miniaturised radiodetector technology** 

 The UoH group worked closely with colleagues in nuclear physics at the University of York to develop miniaturised radio\-HPLC detectors for the QC analysis of PET radiotracer molecules, based on a microfluidic device fabricated out of plastic scintillator and a small footprint, low\-cost silicon photomultiplier \(SiPM\) light sensor<sup>5</sup>. The platform enables real\-time detection of the radioisotope with low analysis volume to minimise sample waste and clinically\-relevant levels of activity \(10MBq to 5GBq\), while offering a far smaller and more versatile unit compared to conventional detectors.<sup>6</sup> This collaboration established the first positron detector available that can be integrated into miniaturised devices \(that are compatible with compact cyclotron technology\), for radiochemistry in tracer production. The patent application has been granted \(see 3\). 

 **2.4: Integrating research and clinical settings** 

 The chemistry research was central to underpin the healthcare advances. Archibald’s team synthesised radiotracers, provided radiopharmaceuticals and gave biomolecular process input for projects in clinical translation involving national and international collaborators. Archibald’s team *optimised scanning protocols for drug delivery* \(collaboration with Hull York Medical School \(HYMS\), HUTH NHS and Chiesi Farmaceutici, Italy\) through radiolabelling chemistry, providing chemical basis for new tracers in *analysed clinical data* \(collaboration with HUTH NHS and Jaber Alahmad Center for Molecular Imaging, Kuwait\) and *informed protocols* for administering radiopharmaceuticals to patients \(HUTH clinical cardiology team\). The chemistry capability in the PETRC on UoH campus was used to test and inform the clinical processes and planning. These projects range from optimising the amount of drug given to patients, through improving the understanding of the biochemical processes, to determining the timing of scans to maximise the potential of a successful clinical outcome. Archibald and Burke synthesised radiotracers to carry out preclinical studies with Nuclear Cardiology at Castle Hill Hospital to develop new 99mTc\-sestamibi scanning protocols used at the HUTH NHS Trust. The teams used the radiotracers to determine the impact of biochemical washout on mitochondrial function reporting to improve understanding of heart tissue viability in cardiac perfusion scans and improve patient treatment.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 
 Fig. 1: New MIRC building due for completion in July 2021: an impact of the research success within the REF period. 

Our impact derives from research innovations in Chemistry, and from partnership with a local charity \(Daisy Appeal\) and HUTH NHS. It improves patient care facilities and increases clinical trial opportunities at Castle Hill Hospital \(that serves Hull and the East Riding of Yorkshire\). Our research into radiopharmaceutical synthesis, molecular imaging processes and next generation NHS radiopharmacy facility design has resulted in multifaceted impacts. UoH’s innovative medical imaging technologies have impacted on patient health \(4.1\), NHS services \(4.2\) and research environment \(4.3\), facilitating international research interactions and attracting skilled workers to the region. These impacts underpinned the vision and strategy for the combined facility that was built on a needs analysis for the region’s medical imaging \(4.4\). A partnership with the NHS and Daisy Appeal charity was established to deliver >£15 million of new facilities that would improve patient care and allow commercial radiosynthesis opportunities to be developed from new technologies and UoH research \(see Fig. 1\). 

 
 Fig. 2: New clinical scanner allowing 3\-fold increase in patient numbers scanned and clinical research scanning. 

**4.1. Impact on patient health** 

 Research by the UoH team underpinned the investment in the next generation of tracers and technologies, and the building of a new clinical facility in Hull. The impact on patient health is facilitated by improved, advanced services for patient care in HUTH NHS. This is delivered through equipment and facilities purchased by Daisy Medical Research Ltd: a non\-profit company with turnover of >£0.5 million that was set up by the consortium. All funds are reinvested in the development of, and research opportunities for, medical imaging, Archibald has been a Director since the company was set up in 2014, contributing scientific expertise and the research strategy. The Jack Brignall PET\-CT centre, built by Daisy Medical Research, offers a huge improvement in patient care. It replaced a limited capacity mobile scanner that was only based at the hospital for two days a week. This permanent fixture increased the number of scans three\-fold, and its state\-of\-the\-art equipment has improved the healthcare and experience of >12,500 patients who have been scanned within the REF period \(see Fig. 2\). The availability of new types of scans tested in the University PET Research Centre has also improved the capabilities of Nuclear Cardiology at Castle Hill Hospital. For example, their research has resulted in changes to 99mTc\-sestamibi scanning protocols at the hospital to improve cardiac ischemia characterisation in >200 seriously ill patients per annum. Other patient groups have similarly benefited due the introduction of innovative scanning programmes/protocols. These include patients with amyloid scans; sarcoidosis and drug delivery to the lung with more than 50 patients benefitting per annum. 

 **4.2. Impact on the NHS** 

 The research relationship with HUTH NHS has led to the development of integrated research facilities at the hospital site and to major change in the practice and delivery of NHS radiopharmacy in Hull. These changes have improved the facilities for delivery of radiopharmacy and reduced the risk of patient service failure to ensure that all patients can receive their diagnosis as rapidly as possible. Three new buildings have been constructed for preclinical research \(including radiochemistry\), clinical scanning and clinical radiotracer production \(at a cost of >£15 million\). A collaborative team has been developed for molecular imaging research across multiple NHS departments and University disciplines. This ensures that service delivery for HUTH NHS is of the highest standard. The ongoing clinical trials have already upskilled the local workforce and enhanced their ability to handle an increased range of patient conditions. NHS staff have been integrated into the University teams with 25 new jobs created by the development so far. 

 **4.3. Impact on the cross\-sector research environment ** 

 As one of five company directors for the not\-for\-profit, Daisy Medical Research Ltd, Archibald has worked with clinical colleagues to ensure the Siemens Biograph PET\-CT flow \(owned by the company\) facilitates research and routine clinical studies. All funds are reinvested into the development of new facilities in the region and the expansion of research capability at UoH and HUTH NHS. Seven patent applications \(six granted\) filed in the REF period and led by the UoH focussed on radiosynthesis and analytical methods. They attracted MRC DPFS funding to bridge from invention to spinout company formation on completion of the MRC project in 2022. 

 **4.4 Driving translational interactions and attracting skilled workers to Hull** 

 Our facility has collaboration agreements for research with other institutions. We have supplied radiotracers synthesised in Hull for preclinical imaging to the University of Leeds and the Medicines Discovery Catapult, and we have delivered Cancer Research UK funded collaborative research studies \(with Imperial College\) to inform a planned clinical trial. Agreements are in progress to supply tracers to the Universities of Liverpool and Sheffield, making our centre a focus for translational medical imaging research in the North of England. The UoH has hosted placement students, internships, PhD studentships and visiting scientists from countries including Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, France, Turkey and Thailand,. We have provided expert training in radiochemistry technology training for researchers and healthcare professionals in the specialised area of positron emission tomography radiochemistry which has been taken back to the home countries. This has facilitated international capabilities for radiochemistry/ radiotracer production. In the REF period there have been 5 externally funded MSc and PhD studentships to explicitly gain radiochemistry skills for international researchers and >20 secondments and PhD student exchanges with staff trained in radiochemistry and radiopharmacy. These researchers have moved back to skilled radiochemistry positions in their home countries \(in many cases the specialised training was part of the funded recruitment process and a strategic expansion of expertise in the home country with UoH identified as a leading global centre for radiochemistry training\). 

 **4.5 Researchers’ design input into shared research\-healthcare facilities** 

 
 Fig. 3: New building designed with University Chemistry Department staff to integrate NHS production with research 

The chemistry research team worked hand\-in\-hand with the NHS radiopharmacy and nuclear medicine staff to design an integrated facility for the production of clinical radiopharmaceuticals \(see Fig. 3\). Archibald and Burke were essential members of the planning group, working with medical staff, the project managers and architects to design an integrated healthcare facility where research and healthcare would develop side by side. Archibald and Burke designed layouts, specified equipment and operational strategy \(staffing requirements\), and decisions on equipment procurement were made by a group led by Archibald. This integration benefits the University as translational studies into healthcare delivery are now possible; it also improved facilities at the Castle Hill Hospital site for radiopharmaceutical production dramatically. This process also upskilled NHS staff with the latest technology for future patient benefit \(eight NHS staff are affiliated to the UoH and five received additional hands\-on training on campus in the new radiochemistry technology\). This process therefore benefits our collective research capacity as well as healthcare delivery.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In the North East of England the severity of welfare austerity has led to significant cuts to local authority budgets. This has been particularly difficult for families with disabled members who have found their opportunities for social inclusion in society reduced. It has also increased the pressures on families to both manage the loss of support and to advocate for their needs and rights. McLaughlin’s research with families and disabled people, particularly children, and third sector organisations that advocate for them, captures both their experiences of austerity and of campaigning. Drawing from that research and working with families and organisations, her work has produced change in regional public policy. One area where the research approach is leading to direct change in local government policy is the Nowhere To Go collaboration with disability and carer groups and North East local authorities to improve the provision and accessibility of public toilets. These policy changes have had a proven positive impact on the approach to and implementation of specific public services, which will, post Covid\-19 \(see Covid\-19 impact statement\), reduce the social exclusion of disabled people and their families. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since coming to Newcastle University in 2001, the lives of families with disabled children in the North East have been at the heart of McLaughlin’s research **\[PUB 1** and **PUB 2\]**. Three ESRC funded projects have produced new insights that have contributed to medical sociology and to critical disability studies, as well as areas examining embodiment, family and kinship studies and youth transitions. The approaches taken in this portfolio of research are grounded in a core commitment to being **inclusive in design** and **impactful in outcomes**. 

  

 Key insights from the research include: 

1.  **The paucity of support provided by local and national state agencies and how this heightens the isolation and marginalisation of families.** McLaughlin has shown how crucial limitations in disability support and public services produce social exclusion for families with disabled children and inhibit their participation as equal citizens in society **\[PUB 1\]**. She has documented the ways in which families are required to fill the gaps in social care provision, something that has been exacerbated by welfare austerity. She has also captured the multiple roles carers must adopt, including that of being administrators and advocates for their children, as they navigate the complexities of welfare benefits and areas such as educational support **\[PUB 3\]**. 

1.  **The damage stigma has on the lives of disabled young people and their families.** While stigma is a well\-established concept across medical sociology and disability studies, McLaughlin’s research brings to the fore its embodied dynamics and locates its significance in broader socio\-economic contexts of welfare austerity and neo\-liberalism. Her work highlights the ‘embodied conditionality’ within state and social recognition of disabled people as citizens. This lack of recognition stems from the ways in which their embodiment does not match the norm of the independent, self\-sufficient individual agent celebrated by the neo\-liberal state **\[PUB 4** and **PUB 5\]**. 

1.  **The value of using varied and collaborative approaches to research design when working with families and disabled children and young people in research**. McLaughlin’s research deploys methodological approaches that are participant\-led and varied, including longitudinal narrative interviews, participant and non\-participant observation, journal writing and creative visual methods. For example, she has used drawing, photography work and craft making with disabled young people to go beyond the written word, creating a space for participants to represent the values they embody within their identity – values that provide a counter to the stigma they experience **\[PUB 6\]**. 

1.  **The necessity of** **building long term partnerships with organisations that are run by or work with disabled children and their families to ensure findings influence policy and practice**. Her research is informed by long term partnerships with: \(a\) organisations that support families and disabled children and young people, including Contact a Family North East \(unfortunately now closed\), Disability North, and Investing in Children; \(b\) healthcare providers including Northern Genetics Service and the Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; and \(c\) local authorities including Newcastle City Council and Northumberland County Council. 

1.  Challenging the conditional citizenship of disabled people and their families by **advocating for better conceptual frameworks to recognise their capacities to be citizens with the right to participate in both society and policies and practices that are supposed to benefit them**. McLaughlin makes a compelling case for moving away from basing capacity and rights justifications on liberal individualistic grounds. Instead, she draws from and contributes to feminist arguments about the **relationality of citizenship** by proposing that within egalitarian conditions, the relationships that disabled people exist within, including their families, can enable them to exercise rights and be fully recognised as citizens **\[PUB 1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 McLaughlin’s research and its associated impact began and has remained centred in the North East. The North East is a region where the impacts of welfare austerity over the last decade have been particularly severe for families with disabled members. 25% of people in the North East are disabled, the highest percentage in England, while a  [79% cut in central government](https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/councils-north-east-will-face-ps12bn-funding-gap-2025) funding to North East local authorities since 2010 have left them severely limited in their capacity to provide the public services disabled people and their families need. This is where McLaughlin's work has been able to have significant impact by capturing the costs of austerity on families in multiple areas, including impacts of the loss of public services on greater social exclusion. By facilitating collaboration between local government and families, she ensures a level of knowledge exchange that enables concrete change in policy and the provision of services. The case study highlights one area of important policy impact, which uses her research approach and knowledge to advocate successfully with families and organisations for greater public investment in public services, in particular: **accessible public toilets**. 

  

 **Nowhere To Go \(NTG\)** is a partnership, which began in 2017, between Carers Northumberland, McLaughlin, Professor Derek Bell \(Newcastle University\), other disability and carer organisations such as Disability North, Newcastle Disability Forum, Age UK, and more recently Northumberland County Council and Newcastle City Council. McLaughlin was asked to become involved due to her research with families with disabled children highlighting the impacts of limitations in public services **\[PUB 2\]**. The team began their work by consulting carers and disabled people about what they believed were the greatest contributors to their social exclusion. Resoundingly what people said was that the lack of public toilets and the poor accessibility of those that remained was a key reason they did not leave the house. Parents of disabled children in those discussions and in McLaughlin’s previous research spoke of changing children on the dirty floors of public toilets and of their battles with schools to adequately support their child’s toilet needs **\[PUB 2\]**. Local authorities have no statutory obligation to provide public toilets, and this has meant their availability and upkeep has been one of the main casualties of welfare austerity. For example, Newcastle City Council provides no stand\-alone public toilets, relying instead on toilets provided in commercial, leisure and community spaces.  [<ins>Kings Fund Research</ins>](https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2019/04/do-we-care-enough-public-toilets) found that local authority spending on public toilets had declined 50% between 2009 and 2019. Working with carer and disability organisations and with carers and disabled people, NTG have responded by producing a range of resources informed by McLaughlin’s research on embodied stigma **\[PUB 5\]**. The resources highlight the need to talk about and understand disabled people’s different toilet needs and to advocate for change in local authority policy. Alongside film and  [<ins>online</ins>](https://www.accessiblespaces.co.uk/) awareness raising material generating greater understanding of what the issues are, one very practical resource is the *How to Improve the Accessibility of Public and Customer Toilets Guide*. NTG ran a number of workshops between 2017 and 2019 that brought local government \(county, city and town and parish councils\), tourism agencies and disability and carer organisations together to inform the development of the resources and then to begin to shape policy and service provision amongst the local government actors and agencies. 

  

 Across council policy makers, advocacy organisations and disabled people and carers, the feedback has been that NTG has improved policy processes by creating spaces for voices to be heard, knowledge exchange to happen, for new partnerships to emerge and transformations in thinking to occur. A Town and Parish Councillor after a workshop in 2018 to launch the Guide and other resources confirmed that she would ‘ *discuss with my fellow parish councillors how we can support the provision of accessibility of different types of toilet provision*’ and that she would ‘ *plan in the budget for future provision of accessible and appropriate toilets… include all stakeholders particularly in new developments*’ **\[IMP 1\]**. The current CEO of Carers Northumberland in local press coverage of the launch of the guide explained ‘ *Carers have been instrumental in shaping the direction of the research carried out by Newcastle University and are buoyed that their experiences and suggestions have been considered for the implementation of the guide*’ **\[IMP 2\]**. A parent of a disabled young person echoed this when she voluntarily contacted NTG to say: ‘ *This was a project I am proud to have been involved with and the guide is excellent. I appreciate the amendments you made at my request for my own story’* **\[IMP 3\]**. The previous CEO of Carers Northumberland and now Head of Network Support in the Carers Trust explained that the benefit of working with NTG for them was that: ‘ *While we knew about all these issues anecdotally, what we didn’t have was access to research or resources that captured the experiences of carers and the people they care for, nor used their knowledge and experience to advocate for change*’ and that working with NTG ‘ *has helped Carers Northumberland build working relationships with other groups in our region and crucially a closer ongoing dialogue with the Council*’ **\[IMP 4\]**. The Head of Neighbourhood Services at Northumberland County Council noted that NTG: ‘ *gave policy and decision makers the opportunity to discuss individual needs with carers and individuals with disabilities, this fundamentally shifted my perspective and resulted in me considering the toileting needs of disabled people in every conversation I had about public conveniences thereafter*’ **\[IMP 5\]**. After a knowledge exchange seminar in 2019 where McLaughlin, along with Carers Northumberland and Northumberland County Council discussed their collective activities, an AHRC Strategy and Development Manager who had been present got in touch with McLaughlin to say: ‘ *I was so impressed by the rigour and sensitivity of the team, and I thought it was an excellent example of researchers engaging with local policy\-makers and providing a bridge between the Council and service users*’ *experiences*’ **\[IMP 6\]**. 

  

 NTG is also having a concrete influence on policy and practice to improve access to the public sphere and reduce social exclusion by raising the number and quality of public toilets in the region. Due to the precarious financial situation of local third sector organisations who work with disabled people and families, the focus of the *How to Improve the Accessibility of Public and Customer Toilets Guide* is on low\-cost design changes that such organisations could implement, enabling them to increase the accessibility of their toilets for their users with complex needs. This means that community organisations in areas where families are affected by significant health inequalities can implement recommendations. For example, the Meadow Well Community Organisation in North Shields used the Guide to review and update their toilet provision and training of staff and volunteers. Their Chief Officer explained: ‘ *As Chief Officer of a local charity, it is an absolute priority to make funds go as far as possible to meet the needs of our local residents where disability and health inequalities mean they live around 11 years less than those living just 2 miles away in St Mary’s ward. The research pointed us to easy and inexpensive ways to ensure that our toilets were properly signposted and accessible to those with hidden disabilities as well as those with visible needs*’ **\[IMP 7\]**. 

  

 The Guide, and the knowledge gained by working with NTG and its disability and carer organisation partners, are now changing the policies and service provision of Newcastle City Council and Northumberland County Council. This is leading to improvements in the availability and accessibility of toilets in the region. Newcastle City Council is working with NTG as part of their goal to make the city Dementia Friendly. Engaging with NTG raised their awareness of the difficulties created for those with Dementia and their families by poor toilet availability and design. As a direct result of the NTG work with the Council, the Newcastle Labour Party now has a manifesto commitment to develop partnerships with others to improve the quality of accessible toilets provided by organisations such as shopping centres, leisure centres and community organisations **\[IMP 8\]**. The Cabinet Member for Health and Social Care confirmed with us that: ‘ *I just wanted to let you know that at our manifesto planning session this week, we agreed to reaffirm our commitment to working with partners to provide and improve availability of accessible toilets and changing facilities in the city. As you know, as a result of our \[NTG\] meetings and joint work… my fellow councillors and wider party members were pleased to hear about the progress we have made with this practical example of making the city inclusive and welcoming to all*’ **\[IMP 9\]**. Prior to the first Covid\-19 lockdown, NTG were advising Newcastle City Council on improving the accessibility of toilets provided within the Grainger Market, a market used by older people from economically deprived areas of the city. While this work has been paused due to Covid\-19, NTG are providing advice to the Council on the need to factor accessible toilet issues and needs into the changes happening in the city due to the pandemic. 

  

 On the 7July 2020 \(delayed due to Covid\-19\), Northumberland County Council Cabinet approved a new policy that directs GBP300,000 of capital spend to improve accessible public toilet provision **\[IMP 10\]**. This funding will be used to completely refurbish public toilets \- including the provision of Changing Places toilets \- in two of the largest tourist areas in the region: Lindisfarne and Seahouses. The case for funding drew directly from NTG recommendations in the *How to Improve the Accessibility of Public and Customer Toilets Guide* and the case made in the Guide that improved toilet provision would be an asset to the tourist industry. Northumberland County Council’s Head of Neighbourhood Services acknowledged the importance of the work with NTG, saying that NTG ‘ *directly influenced activities we have undertaken and funding decisions on local services that have been made,’* and that ‘ *\[i\]ts grounding in Professor McLaughlin’s long\-term research on disability and family life gave us the confidence to make use of their findings*’ **\[IMP 5\]**. NTG are working with the Council on the refurbishment plans, including leading on consultations with users \(delayed by Covid\-19\) and plans for further significant investment \(GBP1,000,000\) within the medium\-term budget planning cycle for 2021\-2024. 

  

 In sum, McLaughlin’s work in the North East supports individual and collective advocacy, user organisation and policy maker knowledge exchange and efforts to improve important aspects of public services. As a consequence this will lead to important changes in the ability to participate in life outside the home for the people and families she has worked with.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 This case study shows how the Secretary of State’s eventual decision in 2018 to block the proposed merger between 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox and Sky on plurality grounds was rooted in evidence produced by Schlosberg over the course of the merger review, as referenced by the Secretary of State, Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\). The cost of the deal was put at £11.7 billion and it would have given 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox access to Sky’s 22 million customers in Europe and given the Murdoch family full control over the UK’s third largest television news provider, and an unparalleled news audience reach across platforms. 

 The implications of the CMA’s findings extend beyond the merger and set important precedents for media plurality regulation going forward. Ofcom’s report to the Secretary of State on media ownership rules in November 2018 repeated the CMA’s conclusions, noting that “the evidence indicates that the rise of news online has not yet materially reduced the influence of traditional news” whose “content is widely consumed on third party platforms”. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Probing the significance of agenda influence by mainstream and legacy news has formed the bedrock of Dr Schlosberg’s research into media plurality, most comprehensively addressed in his 2016 book *Media Ownership and Agenda Control* \(Routledge\)<sup>4</sup>. 

 This book revisited critical questions of media ownership and political economy amidst the complexities of the information age, from the resurgence of press barons to the new influence wielded by tech giants. It drew on a body of research led by Schlosberg and dating back to 2012. 

 A key message from Schlosberg’s research is that digital platforms like Google and Facebook are not inherently pluralising forces when it comes to news consumption, and that there remain a very small number of news providers at the level of wholesale daily newsgathering. In contrast to what is often assumed, the voice of ‘legacy media’ – including newspapers and television news – tends to be amplified rather than marginalised by the platforms. This is set against an emergent consensus on the need to replace legacy frameworks for regulating plurality, but a degree of policy inertia and uncertainty over how to do it. 

 Many of Schlosberg’s published outputs contain key policy recommendations that have gained significant traction in media policy debates, ranging from a proposed levy on intermediaries to reforms of the public interest test governing media mergers<sup>3,5</sup>.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Over the course of the 2010s, the internet has become an increasingly common way in which people access the news. This has produced a number of emergent policy and regulatory challenges, not least concerning how to ensure that the public is exposed to plural sources of news. In the UK and much of the developed world, the ascendance of platform monopolies has coincided with the consolidation of reach and dominance by ‘legacy’ media in the online news market. 

 Schlosberg’s research has been instrumental in understanding this rapidly changing landscape, the dangers it poses to media plurality, and in shaping governmental response. In 2014, Schlosberg was invited to present oral evidence to a Lords Select Committee Inquiry into media plurality, on behalf of the Media Reform Coalition and on the basis of his 2013 book on *Power beyond Scrutiny* \(output 6\). His evidence was cited in the Committee’s  [final report](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldselect/ldcomm/120/120.pdf)<sup>1</sup><sup>a</sup> immediately prior to a key recommendation: that any monitoring and assessment of media plurality should not limit itself to the media channel through which content is primarily delivered but should also factor in the influence of digital intermediaries. The government subsequently endorsed this recommendation in its response to the report<sup>1b</sup>. 

  

 In 2015, Schlosberg was invited to author an essay for the influential Westminster think tank ResPublica on the  [*Mission of Media in an Age of Monopoly*](http://www.respublica.org.uk/our-work/publications/mission-media-age-monopoly/) *.* In addition to echoing his evidence to the Select Committee, in this essay Schlosberg pushed the recommendation that major online platforms should be subject to plurality regulation. In 2018, Schlosberg also pressed this point with Dame Cairncross ahead of her government\-commissioned review into the  [sustainability of journalism](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/779882/021919_DCMS_Cairncross_Review_.pdf) *.* A key recommendation from the Cairncross Review was that a news quality obligation should be imposed on online platforms<sup>2</sup>. The Cairncross review was accepted by the government and in the resulting 2019  [white paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/online-harms-white-paper/online-harms-white-paper) on Online Harms called for a new code of practice and imposed a statutory duty of care on online platforms which included the objective of “promoting diverse news content” directly in line with Schlosberg’s recommendations<sup>3</sup>. 

 The evidence produced by Schlosberg’s research directly informed the Government’s review of the proposed merger between 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox Inc and Sky Plc. 

 In December 2016, Fox and Sky announced their intention to merge. The cost of this deal was put at £11.7 billion \(or GBP11,700,000,000\) and it would have given 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox access to Sky’s 22 million \(i.e. 22,000,000\) customers in Europe<sup>4</sup>. Most controversially, it would have allowed the Murdoch family to gain complete control over Sky News – the UK’s third biggest television news provider – alongside their existing dominance in both print and online news markets. \(Fox was also in a second £54.2 billion \(or GBP54,200,000,000\) merger negotiation with Disney at the same time which, if both mergers went ahead, would, by default, have given Disney full ownership of Sky, extending its global reach into Europe significantly\). The Fox/Sky merger proposal was submitted for government approval and opened to public consultation. From the beginning, Schlosberg’s research proved pivotal in opposing the merger. 

 Schlosberg wrote an initial report on behalf of Media Reform Coalition and Avaaz on the likely impact of the proposed merger on plurality \(output 2 in the underpinning research section\). According to the then Secretary of State, this was one of ‘approximately 50 written submissions’ from third parties submitted to the government in the wake of the merger proposal, but the only one cited in  [her letter of March 2017](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/610045/r_20130303_Sky_letter_FINAL.pdf) to the merging parties<sup>5</sup>. This informed the parties of her provisional decision to refer the merger for regulatory review, noting that “Aspects of \[Schlosberg’s\] report appear to support some of the considerations \[…\] that have informed the Secretary of State's current provisional view.” 

 Ofcom’s subsequent  [<ins>public interest test report</ins>](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/103620/public-interest-test-report.pdf)<sup>6</sup> in June 2017 made 26 references to a further submission authored by Schlosberg, considerably more than any other by third party experts or civil society groups. Issues which were uniquely vocalised in Schlosberg’s submission and featured Ofcom’s report include arguments about wholesale and inter\-media agenda influence. These were flagged in the key findings as raising substantial concerns about the public interest risks posed by the deal. 

 The second phase of the inquiry, which opened in September 2017, focused on two public interest grounds for considering the impact of the proposed merger: media plurality and a commitment to broadcasting standards. Schlosberg was the sole expert speaking to media plurality issues in  [<ins>a hearing convened</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a169f5740f0b627df214220/campaign-groups-transcript-hearing-271017.pdf) by the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\) with advocacy groups and other third parties in October 2017 and was the individual subject to most questions fielded by the CMA<sup>7</sup>. 

 Throughout the inquiry, Schlosberg was the sole author of reports and submissions on plurality made on behalf of the Media Reform Coalition and Avaaz but his work was recognised by other organisations who also campaigned against the merger primarily on grounds of the detrimental impact to broadcasting standards. 

 In November 2017, 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox submitted a  [<ins>93\-page dossier</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a0ae27e40f0b60b04839a98/fox-reply-to-mra-and-avaaz-response-to-issues-statement.pdf) to the CMA solely focussed on critiquing Schlosberg’s evidence, including two appended reports by commercial consultancy firms. Schlosberg responded  [<ins>in full</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a38df26e5274a7908e35d5d/media_reform_coalition.pdf) to this submission at the invitation of the CMA in a report that included a statement of support from Professor Philip M. Napoli, a leading global authority on media plurality whose record of publications and testimony to US regulators is extensive. 

 Both the CMA’s  [<ins>provisional findings</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a71fe2be5274a7f9c5862d4/provisional_findings_report.pdf)<sup>9a</sup> in January 2018 and  [<ins>final report</ins>](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cma-phase-2-report)<sup>9b</sup> published by the CMA in May 2018 broadly concurred with Ofcom’s findings and the arguments on plurality put forward by Schlosberg, including several direct quotations from his authored submissions and an  [<ins>appendix</ins>](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a6f31cce5274a0a3ad91fcf/appendices_and_glossary.pdf)<sup>9b</sup> in which Schlosberg’s analysis of news agenda leading was profiled \(along with a similar study conducted by researchers at Cardiff University in 2015\). This appendix found that ‘The evidence in these studies does, however, support the view at least that traditional news providers \(whether on their established print or broadcast medium or online\) together play a significant part in driving the news agenda.’ 

 The CMA went further than Ofcom’s public interest test report and adjusted Ofcom’s allocation of cross\-platform market shares to reflect, in part, two key findings from Schlosberg’s research: 1\) in the UK, much of the news consumed via intermediaries is in fact produced by wholesale news providers, including those owned and controlled by the Murdoch family and 2\) much of the news delivered by commercial UK radio stations is in fact produced by Sky. 

 The CMA concluded that these adjustments contributed to an increase in the combined market share attributable to Newscorp/Sky \(were the merger to go ahead\) by up to 3%. This adjustment meant that the merged entity would overtake ITN, giving it the largest cross\-market wholesale share of any news organisation apart from the BBC. 

 The CMA further underscored the significance of this by pointing out that the increase in market share as a result of the merger is large relative to the shares of all other established news providers, except BBC and ITN. But unlike Sky, both BBC and ITN have additional public service regulations which promote plurality. 

 Ultimately, the CMA found that the merger ‘may be expected to operate against the public interest taking account of the need, in relation to every different audience in the UK or in a particular area or locality of the UK, for there to be a sufficient plurality of persons with control of the media enterprises serving that audience \(the media plurality consideration\).’ 

 On 1<sup>st</sup> May 2018 the CMA submitted their final report to the Secretary of State, who accepted the CMA’s recommendation that the anticipated acquisition was not in the public interest due to media plurality concerns, a decision which sets an important precedent in media plurality policy and regulation in the UK.<sup>10</sup>

The Middlesex born innovation has advanced Computer Science generating measurable impacts in several directions and citizen groups often neglected by the technology giants. Here we present three of those areas: increasing inclusion for people with Down's syndrome, providing ambient assisted living support for older people in their homes, and encouraging citizens to be more physically active.  Our research on context\-aware systems guides our development and delivery of systems better tailored to the needs of individuals with specific needs.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Intelligent Environments are closely related to areas such as Ubiquitous Systems and IoT systems, and refer to systems which exist in a physical environment enriched with sensing technology and Artificial Intelligence algorithms to provide context\-sensitive help to humans. Specific challenges in these systems around the core concepts of contexts and context\-awareness, which our work focus on. There has been work on contexts from an Artificial Intelligence perspective led by J. McCarthy in the 80’s and 90’s and then focused on how inferences in different contexts relate to each other in general. However our work is much more guided by the specific needs from practical contexts and what users expect from system services in those contexts. 

 Our research group \( [http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/](http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/)\) has been working to improve the development of Intelligent Environments \(IE\) since its creation in 2013. Amongst the challenges we faced there were those on the engineering side with a lack of methods and tools specifically helpful for developing these types of systems.  Also, despite the interesting advances in AI, these powerful algorithms did not offer the right balance on expressiveness and efficiency to be run in systems with low resources and with fast reactions expected.  Advice on engineering Intelligent Environments \(IEs\) systems has been patchy or not transferrable.  Hence, we created our own refined versions of existing approaches to system development, including the “User\-centred Intelligent Environments Development Process” \[Augusto et al., 2017\], an iterative process centred on stakeholder’s engagement.  Part of that high level strategy also included our own method to gather “Requirements for Intelligent Environments” and an “Ethical Framework for Intelligent Environment Development *”* which were used to influence requirements and from there the whole system \[Jones et al., 2015\]. These were then complemented with specific strategies for “Context\-aware Systems Testing and Validation” \[Augusto et al., 2020a\], \[Augusto et al., 2020b\]. 

 In applying AI we have specialized algorithms to make known AI techniques to work in real life IE scenarios. Our algorithms include real\-time temporal reasoning to automate sensorized environments \[Gimenez\-Manuel et al., 2020\], machine learning to learn user’s habits \[Ali et al., 2019\], and handling possibly conflicting user preferences \[Oguego et al., 2018\].  Those automated learning and reasoning algorithms combined with context\-awareness resources and specialized interfaces provide a new system architecture \[Augusto et al., 2020a\] for intelligent environments. This consistent and integrated innovation allowed our team to win the BCS Machine Intelligence Competition RealAI \(2019 edition\):  [http://www.bcs\-sgai.org/micomp/intro.php](http://www.bcs-sgai.org/micomp/intro.php) 

 These advances on user\-centred engineering processes and tools facilitated the identification of relevant contexts and development of context\-awareness required for the successful development and deployment of real\-life services within various projects including: 

-  Supporting independence for people with Down’s syndrome \(Supported during 2013\-2016 by the EU through a 4M Euros funded project: “PersOnalized Smart Environments to increase Inclusion of people with DOwn's syndrome \(POSEIDON\)”\): to decide when users require advice or are in an emergency, or determine the system reaction in those detected contexts.  Contexts of interest are usually organized at system level \(e.g., battery level and connectivity\), person level \(e.g., physical or mental status\), and environment level \(e.g., weather or bus service\). 

-  Ambient Assisted Living \(Partly supported during 2016\-2019 by the EU through a 700K Euros funded project: “SecUre aCCESSibility for the internet of things \(SUCCESS\)”\): the contexts our Smart Home system detects unhealthy sleeping patterns, unhealthy eating patterns, and ‘wandering’, all of which are well known to be meaningful to people experiencing dementia\-like conditions.  These contexts are detected through a specially designed rule\-based temporal reasoning system fed by sensor data. House behaviour adapts to user preference through personalization interfaces and unsupervised learning algorithms.   The Smart Home system was set up as part of the Smart Spaces lab in our campus:  [http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/smart\-spaces\-lab/](http://ie.cs.mdx.ac.uk/smart-spaces-lab/) 

-  Encouraging increase in physical activity within Barnet \(a collaboration supported from 2018 onwards with £136,000 by Greenwich Leisure Limited, a charity company based in London working in the sports market with branches all over the UK, and by Barnet Council\):  this is a Gamification project to encourage citizens to be more physically active.  The system achieves that by combining various techniques stemming from psychology \(for example, behaviour change techniques or BCTs\) which relate individual behavioural contexts to personalized habit formation and lifestyles changes.  The stakeholders centred approaches and methods to identify and develop the context\-awareness of the system have been used in this project. This project is currently ongoing and use in the community was delayed for a year due to Covid, so it is expected to start trialled in the community after spring 2021.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The systems we developed based on our user\-centred systems engineering improvements and in our context\-awareness reasoning and learning algorithms improvements described in section 2 were used to create systems which had a diversity of positive effects: 

 <ins>Societal</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> our systems contributed to the quality of life of different sectors of society with special needs.  Some of them such as people with Down’s Syndrome are usually very much neglected by technology as they are not appealing to the larger dominant innovation companies dominating the digital markets. During the POSEIDON project a total of 200 EU citizens \(PwDS, carers and representatives of national organizations supporting PwDS\) participated from the workshops and pilots. We gathered evidence people with Down’s Syndrome were both keener and more able to use modern digital solutions than previously perceived \(see supporting evidence \[So1\]\).  Our system to support people with early stages of dementia relate to an increasing section of our ageing population who is willing to stay independent and healthier for longer whilst the human resources required are not sufficient.  There is also increasing awareness in society about the negative effects of sedentary life on humans’ health.  Our system to encourage more active lifestyles is building on that awareness to encourage citizens in Barnet to do more physical activity and benefit from that. Some features of the system aims to increase self\-esteem, others to provide reasons for habit building and others to increase social contact within the community \(see supporting evidence \[So2\]\). 

 <ins>Capacity\-building</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> as part of various projects we developed and perfected methods and tools. They are available in project repositories \(see supporting evidence \[Ca1\]\) which we also disseminated through Tutorials and Keynotes at International Conferences as well as eight research students which are now innovators working in other organizations, half of them in business/industry.    Our most recent application of the principles and tools we have designed to assist citizens with context awareness has been used by a company, GLL, to transition from traditional gym based physical activity as their only business model into incorporating app supported individual and team based physical activity.  \(see supporting evidence \[Ca2\]\) 

 <ins>Cultural</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> we informed relevant decision\-makers of the findings of our research which have impact in their specific section of society: 

-  We helped Down’s Syndrome associations to understand how people with Down’s Syndrome were able to increase independence and improve lifestyle choices through digital tools and how that can improve daily life experience for the family as a whole \(see supporting evidence \[So1\]\). 

-  We also informed three teams of senior managers from different boroughs in London about the potential of Ambient Assisted Technologies to provide a digital safety net and point of advice to citizens experiencing early symptoms of dementia\-like conditions \(see \[So2\]\). 

 <ins>Economic</ins> <ins>Impact</ins><ins>:</ins> given our products were not marketed by ourselves and consisted of prototypes, methods and tools which help then design other marketable products, we rely on third parties reporting of economic impact.  From our products the one which had best traceable benefits so far is our contribution to POSEIDON which has been used since by one of the Scandinavian companies involved in the project.  The company used the concepts developed with our help during POSEIDON to improve their offer resulting in a number of different variants of specific products which have been delivered to the European market, especially in the North of Europe. These reportedly produced financial gains to the company which are described to the extent they are traceable by the company Karde \(see supporting evidence \[Eco1\]\). 

 <ins>International Reach:</ins> some of our activities involved partners from outside the UK and we are aware that at least at European level our work on supporting the developments of contexts and their linking with specific situations of interest for citizens with specific needs has been exploited by a Scandinavian company.  Also as part of the legacy of the POSEIDON project we have raised awareness of the digital possibilities for this section of society and we are aware EDSA \(the European Down’s Syndrome Association\) still considers the project an important landmark \(see supporting evidence \[Int1\]\).  An independent U.S.A. based science journalist who has written for several of the most important USA newspapers have made several interviews on our work within the Ambient Assisted Living area to include our views and work in an upcoming book addressing the impact of technology in modern indoor living \[Int2\]. POSEIDON is one of the 90 global projects pre\-selected for the World Sumit on the information Society Prizes 2020 edition \[Int3\].

###  5. Sources to corroborate the impact \(indicative maximum of 10 references\) 

 \[So1\] POSEIDON participant’s questionnaires, interviews, workshops and pilots attracted participation of hundreds of families across Europe. Their feedback and statements from the various non\-academic stakeholders were positive on usefulness and usability and can be consulted in the deliverables available in the project webpage:  [http://www.poseidon\-project.org/research\-scientists/deliverables/](http://www.poseidon-project.org/research-scientists/deliverables/)  See also testimony of this in letter issued by DSA\-UK and signed by the organization representative.  The POSEIDON project then led to a smaller and more focused project with one of their branches: DSActive.  They commissioned from us an exploratory research project funding a Master by Research student who produced a prototype of an app to educate children with DS on the concept of healthy food.  See letter signed by DSACtive. 

 \[So2\] See letter from London Housing Association where they acknowledge their visit to our Hendon Campus Smart Home helped them to understand the benefits of work in this area and also the impact that caused on the visitors and the actions they will take in their respective boroughs: “ *…the visit to the lab changed for better their perception of what is feasible with Smart Homes technological augmentation …. Participants agreed on the importance of taking the knowledge gained from the workshop to their local authorities and other organisations.*”. 

 \[Ca1\] A number of guides, methods and tools for user\-centred design and development of context\-awareness features are offered for free through places such as: 

-  the Developers section in the webpage of the POSEIDON project:  [http://www.poseidon\-project.org/developers/](http://www.poseidon-project.org/developers/) 

-  the Research Group Github:  [https://github.com/GOODIES\-RG](https://github.com/GOODIES-RG) 

 These have been used to create the innovation in the three application clusters we have described, and externally at least by Karde \(one of the Scandinavian partners of POSEIDON\). 

 \[Ca2\] letter from GLL explaining the benefits of engagement with our Research Group on exploring Personalized Behaviour Change Techniques as an alternative to their business options. 

 \[Eco1\]  See letter signed by the C.E.O. of Karde company, a previous partner of our POSEIDON project, where they acknowledge: 

-  the positive influence of our participation in the group: “ *The collaboration with Middlesex University in the POSEIDON project had an impact on society through better understanding of the skills of people with learning disabilities and their abilities to become independent members of the society and actively take part in the working life. Also, our activities had a positive influence on public policy and services towards the target group because of increased attention from politicians and public sector. Finally, our collaboration increased the quality of life for the target group through more independence and better integration in the society.*” 

-  and the financial benefits that taking part of POSEIDON brought to their organization “ *Since POSEIDON Karde has won several national and international contracts for projects which aims to help people with learning disabilities. You may say following the spirit of POSEIDON. The projects have lasted one\-two years and have had budgets on around 50.000 \- 200.000 euros. Karde has had about 20 projects at an average of 100.000 euros which adds up to 2.000.000 euros in the period 2015 – 2020. It will be wrong to say that all of them are results of POSEIDON, but it can be fair to say that 50% is in the POSEIDON spirit, making e\-learning and support systems for people with learning disabilities.*”.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The Centre for Secure Information Technologies \(CSIT\) is a national cybersecurity research institute emphasising research excellence combined with a unique model for, and focus on, commercialisation and innovation. CSIT is the UK’s only Innovation and Knowledge Centre \(IKC\) for cybersecurity. CSIT played a key role in the development of major government reports on cybersecurity strategy and economic policy in the UK and EU. In addition, it has been instrumental in catalysing the development of the Northern Ireland Cybersecurity Ecosystem, DCMS programmes, start\-ups, attracting FDI which had led by 2019 to the creation of approximately 1600 jobs in this sector. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 CSIT was established in 2009 as the UK’s Innovation and Knowledge Centre \(IKC\) in Cyber Security with initial funding from EPSRC, Innovate UK, Invest Northern Ireland, and Industry totaling GBP\[text removed for publication\]. Based on its innovation translation and academic successes, a further GBP\[text removed for publication\] in phase 2 funding \(from 2015 to 2021\), was obtained. 

 The IKC call through which CSIT was created, stated that successful applicants would *“be established in an area of emerging technology where **world\-class scientific breakthroughs had already been achieved,** with the potential to bring about paradigm shifts in a broad range of market applications”*.  Key to the success of CSIT was its ability to produce significant high\-quality impactful research; examples include **R\[1\] Mc Canny, R\[2\] R\[3\], Sezer, R\[1\] R\[4\] R\[5\] O’Neill \(McLoone\), R\[6\] Fusco**. 

 Phase 1 and Phase 2 CSIT IKC funding, was predicated on established, and continued, world\-class high impact research excellence at QUB, in hardware design for applied cryptography; hardware accelerators for inspecting malicious content; physically secured wireless. A representative sample of this body of work sustained before and during CSIT IKC phases 1 and 2 are detailed below. 

 Selected research outputs related to the formation of both IKC phases are: 

 Novel hardware optimizations of the Advanced Encryption Standard \(AES\) resulting in the fastest reported AES design at the time, **R\[1\]**. This technology was successfully commercialized by Amphion Ltd and utilized to provide security in 100,000,000 set\-top box chip sets for which O’Neill \(2014\) was awarded an RAEng Silver Medal. 

 Research on lookup acceleration and pattern matching by Sezer for network processing, **R\[2\], R\[3\],** led to novel architectures for parallelization of data\-dependent pattern matching operations. The work resulted in the formation of a spin\-out company, Titan IC Systems Ltd, 2007, acquired by Mellanox 2020. 

 Research on a hardware evaluation of candidates for the SHA 3 Hash Algorithm, **R\[4\],** informed its standardization by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, post its presentation at the 2010 NIST SHA\-3 candidate conference. 

 A novel Physical Unclonable Function \(PUF\) Identity Generator, to date the lowest in cost, most robust, and efficient design for FPGA devices, was described in, **R\[5\],** and demonstrated by Thales for electronic component counterfeit protection. 

 In **R\[6\]**, a radio system was awarded the 2011 IET MAP Journal premium, then licensed to Microsense Ltd. for use in an advanced microwave security product<ins>,</ins> and won the 2010 regional finals of the Intertrade Ireland Seedcorn Business Competition. 

 Each of the above outputs has made a distinct and material contribution to the development of CSIT’s four key research areas: 

-  Secure connected services 

-  Networked security systems 

-  Industrial control systems 

-  Security intelligence 

 The quality of CSIT’s core body of research was recognized in 2012, through the peer\-reviewed award of Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research \(ACE\-CSR\) status, NCSC/EPSRC. It was one of the first eight UK universities to be awarded this status, renewed in 2017. 

 In 2015, CSIT was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education for its outstanding work in protecting online activity of internet users globally.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 As an IKC, CSIT overlaid its core research excellence with its dedicated business development function and its engineering team to promote industry engagement and facilitate the co\-creation of solutions with industry partners. This led to a unique research and innovation environment. 

 **CSIT’s Role in Job Creation and SME Support** 

 *CSIT* has been heavily involved in UK job creation in the Cyber sector. In 2020 CSIT, on behalf of the UK Government, co\-authored the most comprehensive analysis of the size and scale of the UK’s cyber security industry, **S\[1\]**, which cites 1600 new Cyber jobs in NI \(2019\). The Royal Society Policy Report **S\[2\]** states “\(CSIT\) has formed the centre of a local cybersecurity ecosystem that includes over forty companies”. CSIT has been pivotal to this, through its foreign direct investment engagement with, and provision of talent for, major sector players from the US and beyond, e.g. Black Duck \[text removed for publication\] jobs in Belfast \(2016\). In 2019 NI was the No.1 destination for FDI in cyber security for US companies, **S\[3\]**. **The Director of Technology Invest Northern Ireland said, “it is our assessment that CSIT, through its research, innovation, commercialisation and ecosystem development activities, has been pivotal in growing the NI cyber security sector since its foundation”, S\[4\].** 

 

 

 Six CSIT spin out companies have been created, including Liopa \(2016\) who use lip biometrics for authentication, \(\[text removed for publication\] staff\). This process is facilitated through *CSIT Labs* \(2016\) an incubator programme helping new businesses to start, scale and engineer cyber security products. This to date has assisted 16 early\-stage start\-ups with engineering support to minimum viable product stage. 

 In order to support early\-stage ideas and start\-ups, the UK Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sports has funded three major UK national initiatives in which CSIT is a co\-founding partner. 

 *HutZero* \(2016\) the leading Cyber entrepreneur bootcamp, which by 2020 had delivered five programmes \(116 people\), and seven Cyber security startups. 

 Cyber101 \(2017\), a five\-year programme of business advice and mentoring to help new UK cyber security firms grow. GBP\[text removed for publication\] has been raised by cyber security start\-ups since joining the Cyber 101 programme and 160 start\-ups/scale\-ups have been supported. 

 *The London Office for Rapid Cybersecurity Advancement \(LORCA\)*, Plexal/CSIT/Deloitte, GBP\[text removed for publication\] an innovation accelerator for UK cybersecurity start\-ups.  Since June 2018, 35 companies have completed the LORCA programme with a further 20 currently in progress. These include B\-Secur \(ECG biometric authentication\), a Belfast start\-up which benefitted from CSIT engineering support, and was selected by Tech Nation in 2018 for their *Upscale Programme* supporting 37 of the UK’s fastest growing Tech Companies. Another LORCA company, Angoka, decided to base their development office in Belfast in January 2020 **“all because of CSIT” \(Executive Chairman\) S\[5\].** 

 **The economic impact role played by CSIT was summarised by the ex\-Head Cyber Security Growth and Innovation, DCMS, “ **CSIT have played a critical role in not only developing the world class cyber ecosystem in Northern Ireland, but are an integral part of the wider UK cyber growth and innovation landscape, contributing strongly to the support of DCMS programmes in this area. This is further recognised by their reputation internationally as an exemplar for the role of academia in cyber innovation and ecosystem development”**, S\[6\].** 

 CSIT also co\-founded the international Ecosystem of Ecosystems Partnership in Innovation and Cyber Security \( *Global EPIC*\), 2017, which now has 30 Members in 17 countries, and has launched a global soft landing programme enabling trade and investment opportunities for UK cyber security companies. 

  

 **CSIT influence on Policy** 

 In July 2016, the Royal Society Cyber Security Research Policy Committee \(McCanny  CSIT PI was appointed co\-chair\) published a report on Progress and Research in Cybersecurity, **S\[7\].** The report highlighted that the original GBP850,000,000 UK National Cyber Security Strategy had no explicit cyber security research strategy, and gave little emphasis to research translation, and the role of high technology start\-ups. These key themes were subsequently implemented in the updated National Cybersecurity Strategy 2016 \(sections 7.2.4., 7.2.5., 7.3.\), **S\[8\]**. His work on **S\[8\]** led McCanny \(2017\) to be selected for expert consultation by the EU High Level Group of Scientific Advisors ‘Scientific Opinion No.2/2017 on Cybersecurity in the EU’, **S\[9\].** A Joint Communication to the European Parliament and Council was subsequently delivered, **S\[10\]**, which built on a number of the recommendations listed in **S\[7\]**. This resulted in the establishment of an EU cybersecurity certification framework, now embodied in the 2019 EU Cybersecurity Act.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Due to her research and expertise on the law relating to management of museum collections, from 2011, Ulph led or was centrally involved in a series of significant initiatives concerning guidance and law reform for museum collections. Her distinct contribution has three separate strands: \(1\) changing the guidance and practice on disposals from museum collections in the United Kingdom \(2\) developing guidance on museum closures in the United Kingdom; and \(3\) putting proposals for law reform relating to museum collections in England and Wales on to the policy agenda. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Starting in 2011, Ulph drew upon her extensive expertise in the field of heritage law and personal property law to research the management of museum collections in the United Kingdom. In 2011/12 she held an AHRC/ESRC Placement Fellowship with the Museums Association, for a research project on ‘The Ethical and Legal Aspects of Sales from Museum Collections’. That research led to an academic paper on establishing a due diligence process prior to the sale of collection items **\[R1\]** and to her development of Museums Association guidance on ‘financially motivated’ sales, where a museum sells a collection item with an intention to raise funds **\[E1**, discussed below **\]**. 

 Ulph went on to hold an AHRC Leadership Fellowship in 2014 and 2015 for a research project on ‘The Status of Museum Collections’. Arising out of this project, she published journal articles on the law and ethics of dealing with museum collections **\[R2\]**, on the Museums Association’s Code of Ethics of 2015 **\[R3\]**, and on museum items whose ownership is uncertain **\[R4\]**. She also developed the Museums Association’s ‘Guidance on curatorially motivated disposal in England, Wales and Northern Ireland’ \[ **E2**, discussed below\]. 

 Ulph’s research focused upon responsible management of museum collections. This included analysis of the relationship between law and ethics in relation to acquisitions **\[R5\]** and disposals **\[R1, R2, R4\]** and discussion of whether ethical principles can provide effective guidance in situations where the law may not **\[R3\]**. Her research explored how the need for financial sustainability has created tensions when balanced against an ethical obligation to recognise and protect the special cultural value of heritage items held for the public benefit. The research followed an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon legal and ethical sources, as well as museological, archaeological and palaeontological literature and debates. 

 Ulph’s research led to two key recommendations concerning the law relating to museum collections thatwould set the agenda for policy in the area. First, as her research showed that the law governing local authorities’ museum collections was highly uncertain, she recommended that legislation be adopted to clarify the powers of local authorities in relation to their collections, especially in relation to sales and other disposals **\[R1, R2\]**. Secondly, she recommended that accredited museums, archives and libraries should be able to obtain legal ownership of objects if they have had them in their possession for a minimum of 30 years, and reasonable efforts have been made to locate any possible owner **\[R4\]**. This was intended to address the common situation that museums may not know the owner of certain collection items, so that they cannot confidently dispose of or repair the items concerned or transfer them to other museums \(including in cases of repatriation\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *Changing guidance and practice relating to disposals in the heritage sector* 

 The main purpose of Ulph’s AHRC/ ESRC Placement Fellowship in 2011\-2012 was to collaborate with the Museums Association in developing its guidance on the sale of items from collections. The Museums Association and the Arts Council decided that, with Ulph’s assistance, the general guidance on disposals in *The Disposal Toolkit: Guidelines for Museums* \[ **E1**\]  should be updated . Ulph advised on key aspects of this document – including obtaining the advice of the Charity Commission to the effect that minor items such as medals or wedding dresses could be returned to owners where that was possible, and beneficial to the museum and in the public interest. 

 Ulph was also the main author of a separate Appendix 4 to the *Disposal* *Toolkit* entitled *Additional Guidance on Financially Motivated Disposal*, which relates to sales of collection items \[Appendix to **E2**: Ulph recognised as lead author at p 3\] **.** This guidance was entirely novel, as no equivalent provision had previously been made for sales from collections. Appendix 4 sets out key points that museums should reflect upon at each stage of the process, including legal issues relating to ownership, the obligations of a seller, export laws, and practical ethical matters, such as early con *sultation with public bodies. To quote the policy officer of the Museums Association “Ulph introduced the concept of a due diligence process for all disposals*” **\[E8\].** 

 The significance of the *Disposal Toolkit*, including its Appendix 4, is that the Museums Association’s Code of Ethics requires all museums to follow this guidance. In March 2015, the Museums Association, Arts Council England and other stakeholder bodies issued a formal Joint Statement condemning unethical sales and declaring that museums engaged in financially motivated sales were required to follow the procedure set out in the *Disposal Toolkit*. Arts Council England museum accreditation guidance \( **\[E3\]**, 2019\) includes requirements that all accredited organisations follow processes set out in the Museums Associations Disposal Toolkit and includes a section on financially\-motivated disposal. To quote a senior manager at the Arts Council England, the guidance on disposal and sale “ *are embedded and well\-used across the museum sector*” **\[E13\].** 

 If a sale was viewed as unethical, a museum’s reputation would be damaged, and it would risk losing its accreditation, and thereby the opportunity to apply for government grants. Prior to the publication of Appendix 4 in 2014, unethical sales had been an increasing problem: for example, Croydon Museum was publicly stripped of its accreditation for this reason in 2013, followed by Northampton Museums Service in 2014. Since 2015, however, no museum has been found to have been involved in an unethical sale, and that change can be attributed to the guidance. 

 Ulph went on to work with Arts Council England and the Museums Association in 2014\-2015, when she held an AHRC Leadership Fellowship to enable further research on the legal and ethical status of museum collections. In 2015, she was sole author of a 59\-page document entitled *Guidance on Curatorially Motivated Disposal in England, Wales and Northern Ireland* **\[E2\]**. The guidance is wide\-ranging in scope and advises on key issues for museums, such as how to distinguish between a gift, a loan and a trust, the implications for the museum if it does not clearly own a collection item and dealing with competing claims regarding a collection item *.* According to the Association’s policy officer “ *The Museums Association publishes this guidance on its website as part of our core suite of advice on disposal from collections, and it has been downloaded thousands of times since publication*” **\[E8\]**. 

 The 2015 guidance has frequently proven indispensable to museums seeking to resolve problems with other museums and with benefactors **\[E8\]**. Individual museums have sought direct assistance from Ulph: for example, the Norfolk Museums Development Officer sought advice when the museum was struggling to persuade the owner to take back a railway carriage, and Ulph’s assistance led to important cost savings for the museum **\[E11\].** 

 Since 2011, Ulph has been involved in some 30 workshops organised by the UK Registrars Group, the Collections Trust, and national museums, or regional groups, such as the Museum of London, Museums East and Museums Development North West \(MDNW\). The workshops primarily involved discussion of curatorially motivated and financially motivated disposals, acquisitions, and museum closures. Evidence of the practical effect of these workshops is provided by a museum curator who had worked for Fylde Council in Lancashire: in her words, as a result of Ulph’s advice on disposals at a workshop in 2017, “ *there had been an about\-turn in the views of Council leaders and the idea of selling from the collection had been dropped*” **\[E12\].** 

 *Influencing sector\-wide guidance on museums facing closure* 

 In 2016, Ulph was invited to be a member of a team convened by Arts Council England to consider the response to the High Court judgment in *R \(Hall\)* v. *Leicestershire County Council* \[2015\] EWHC 2985, a judicial review challenge to a planned museum closure. In his judgment, Mr Justice Blake had remarked upon the absence of policy guidance concerning museum closures from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund and the Museums Association. The Arts Council England group produced novel guidance, first published by the Museums Association in 2017, entitled *Museums Facing Closure: Legal and Ethical Issues* **\[E4\]**. To quote a senior manager at Arts Council England, Ulph “ *had a leading and highly influential role as the only legal representative and expert in cultural property law*” **\[E13\].** Her contributions addressed the implications of insolvency, of the public sector equality duty, charity law, and the ownership of collections. 

 The guidance concerning closures has continued to be highly relevant to the sector. To quote the Museum Association, “ *In 2016\-17, Prof Ulph advised the Museums Association on the production of guidance on Museums Facing Closure – an issue that has unfortunately been at the forefront of the sector’s concerns during austerity and more recently Covid\-19. Indeed, this document has become a key part of the sector’s response to the challenges of the pandemic*” **\[E8\]**. The Collections Trust noted the value of the guidance in its June 2020 evidence on the impact of COVID\-19 to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee **\[E7\]**. 

 Ulph’s expertise in relation to museum closures also led to an invitation from Lancashire County Council to a meeting on 3 August 2016 to discuss its plans to close five museums, and to disperse thousands of heritage objects. Participants at the meeting included a council member, representatives of the council legal department, and professionals from the museums concerned. As a result of Ulph’s advice, the local authority changed its disposal plans and Ulph was informed that her input was “crucial” to the decision to retain ownership of certain collections **\[E10\].** 

 *Putting the need for museums law reform* *on the policy agenda* 

 Through her research published in 2013 **\[R1\]**, 2015 **\[R2\]** and 2017 **\[R4\]**, Ulph has advocated for new legislation for England, Wales and Northern Ireland concerning museum collections, to clarify the powers of local authorities, and to address the highly uncertain legal regime relating to ownership of collections. 

 In 2016, she responded to the call by the Law Commission for England and Wales for suggestions for law reform, making the case for the legal regime relating to museum collections to be reformed. Relying on her published research **\[R1–R4\]**, she persuaded the Law Commission that law reform was needed and would serve the public benefit \(see testimonial of Law Commissioner **\[E9\]**\). The Law Commission then consulted the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport, which accepted the need for law reform on behalf of the Government **\[E9\]**. The Commission went on to include museum collections as a confirmed project in its *13<sup>th</sup> Programme of Law Reform*, published in December 2017 *.* It identified the two issues flagged by Ulph – uncertainty as to legal ownership, and the powers of local authorities over collections \- as the main ones it planned to examine \[ **E5**, paras 2.27 and 2.28\] *.* 

 The law reform project outlined by Ulph in 2016 has remained high on the policy agenda in the cultural heritage sector. In February 2017, she gave a presentation on it to a meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for the Protection of Cultural Heritage. At that meeting the APPG agreed that local authority powers in relation to museum collections needed further examination and that there should be new legislation to deal with uncertainty regarding ownership. At the APPG meeting the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport announced its own independent review into museums by Neil Mendoza, whose report in November 2017 supported an exploration of “how museums might acquire legal ownership of these objects where no owner can be traced after an appropriate length of time” \[ **E6**, at p. 45\]. More recently, the Collections Trust’s June 2020 evidence on the impact of COVID\-19 stated that “ *in view of the fact that proving title to the collections of insolvent museums is about to become very pressing indeed, we ask that the Law Commission be supported to fast\-track this investigation”* **\[E7\].** 

  

 *The public benefit of new guidance and law on museum collections* 

 There are approximately 2,500 museums in the UK of which about 1,800 have become accredited \[see **E8**\]. According to the Museums Association, visitors are likely to exceed 100 million each year \[ [https://www.museumsassociation.org/about/faqs/](https://www.museumsassociation.org/about/faqs/)\]. 

 Ulph’s research is therefore of wide public benefit, in that it recognises and protects the special cultural value of heritage items, by promoting responsible management of museums through the development of guidance and law reform proposals relating to museum collections.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The school component of English In Action \(EIA\) was a large\-scale project designed with the aim of improving English language teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools across Bangladesh. Using: i\) material delivered by mobile technologies; ii\) teacher development activities in the workplace and iii\) peer support opportunities, EIA provided an innovative way of improving English language teaching at scale. The EIA programme achieved large\-scale systemic engagement from teachers, head teachers and education officers across all eight divisions and 64 districts of Bangladesh. This has delivered an impact on: i\) **practitioners** by changing the classroom practice of 53,271 teachers \- away from presenting to students and towards encouraging more student\-talk in English ii\) **learning** by improving the English language competence of 7.4 million students and iii\) **public policy** by influencing two Government bodies to incorporate EIA materials into their curriculum resources and engage EIA expertise in the design of content for new teacher development programmes \- thus embedding the EIA materials and pedagogic approach within the Bangladesh educational system, to secure long\-term, sustainable, systemic change and iv\) public policy by influencing approaches to teacher development outside of Bangladesh. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 For many years, English language was the most failed subject in schools in Bangladesh. Poor quality English language teaching was identified as a root cause, with teachers not knowing how to put ‘Communicative Language Teaching’ into practice. Teachers themselves had limited English skills and students typically had very little opportunity to speak in English during English language lessons. Funded by DFID, over a 10\-year period, the school component of EIA focused on demonstrably improving English language teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools across Bangladesh. Researchers from the OU worked with international partners BMB Mott McDonald and BBC Media Action, as well as local NGOs such as Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programs \(UCEP\) and Friends in the Village Development Bangladesh \(FIVDB\) to develop an iterative EIA programme of research and development. Between 2008 and 2011 OU researchers developed and trialled their working hypothesis which posited that the most effective way of achieving large\-scale teacher development in Communicative English Language Teaching in Bangladesh was to implement a programme that was: 

 **Technology\-enabled**: bespoke audio resources alongside teacher development videos, that demonstrate and explore Communicative Language Teaching approaches in authentic classroom settings, are delivered using devices such as iPods/MP3 players or mobile phones. 

 **School\-based**: teacher development activities are delivered in the workplace \- where teachers enquire into their own classroom practice, explore new teaching\-learning approaches, and develop practical insights into improving student learning. 

 **Networked**: Teachers' development progresses through peer\-learning and shared journeys of discovery, as opposed to cascading 'knowledge' through teacher educators. 

 The initial EIA ‘intervention’ at the heart of the programme was therefore a school\-based professional development model that blended Technology Enhanced Learning \(where Communicative Language Teaching principles and examples were delivered through audio\- visual material on an MP3 player\) with face\-to\-face support, such as orientation workshops, cluster meetings with teachers on the same programme and visits from teacher facilitators. The appropriateness of this model was examined by conducting observations and interviews with 6 schools that were participating in a pre\-pilot intervention in 2009 \(randomly chosen from 15 pre\-pilot schools\). Data from classroom observations, regarding how teachers were using the technology, informed interviews with 12 teachers. Results indicated that the teachers responded well to both the pre\-loaded material on the iPod and the peer support from cluster meetings and facilitator visits. Furthermore, changes in practice were being reported after just four months **\[O1\]**. Further studies enabled a more nuanced understanding of the influence of the intervention. For example, field\-tests were undertaken with 40 teachers between March and April 2011 in order to ascertain whether teachers would prefer to use mobile phones \(with SD cards that contained pre\-loaded EIA material\) rather than iPods. Analysis of data taken from surveys, interviews and focus groups indicated that teachers preferred using mobile phones and found it easy to use the SD cards. These results informed the Upscaling Phase of EIA and enabled the programme to implement a more sustainable way forward **\[O2, O3\]**. Semi\-structured interviews were conducted with 600 primary school children from schools, in different regions in Bangladesh, who were participating in the pilot intervention phase in 2010. These interviews were used to examine the children’s beliefs concerning English language Learning and their perceptions regarding English language Teaching in an EIA pilot intervention school. Results indicated that overall, the children responded well to, and had positive beliefs about, the value of the activities associated with a Communicative Language Teaching approach **\[O4\]**. Finally, an overarching evaluation of the pilot intervention phase, used case study examples to illuminate the conclusion that teacher facilitators needed more support and guidance on how to enact their role in order to improve the effectiveness of the school\-based support model **\[O5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The EIA programme achieved large\-scale systemic engagement from teachers, head Teachers and education officers across all eight divisions and 64 districts of Bangladesh **\[C1\]**. Between 1st August 2013 to March 2018 EIA dramatically increased its reach, through a shift away from direct contact with international and national English Language Teaching \(ELT\) experts, towards a distinctive model where ELT practice expertise was embedded in Mediated Authentic Videos accessed on mobile phones, delivered through partnership with Government Teacher Professional Development systems and staff, and supported primarily by teachers’ peers \(including Teacher Facilitators\). From August 2013 to March 2018, over 53,000 teachers participated in EIA: 10,563 secondary teachers and 42,708 primary teachers **\[C2\]**. Collectively, these teachers taught approximately 7.4M school children \(3.1M primary and 4.3M secondary children\) **\[C2\]**. More specifically, EIA has achieved impacts on **practitioners**, **learning** and **public policy** in Bangladesh by: i\) changing the classroom practice of teachers; ii\) improving the English Language competence of students; iii\) shaping the content of English Language Teaching Curriculum Material and iv\) influencing approaches to teacher development in Bangladesh and v\) influencing approaches to teacher development outside of Bangladesh, demonstrating global impact. 

1.  **Changing the classroom practice of teachers** 

 There is evidence that EIA has contributed to changes in teachers’ confidence to speak English and use English in the classroom. For example, at a divisional workshop in Rajshahi in 2017, teachers underlined that EIA had triggered inner changes in them, which they saw as a pre\-condition for changing students: *“I changed myself, now I am a change maker. Without a change in students, a teacher is 0” \(*Assistant Teacher English/secondary and Teacher Facilitator, Rajshahi division, 23.8.2017\); *“EIA has developed me personally and professionally”* \(participant, Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\). The participants also reported that they felt more at ease speaking English among themselves and with their students: *“Now I am able to speak in English in any forum”* \(participant, Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. EIA has also brought about changes in the classroom practices of teachers. In 2014\-2015, 1,600 teachers provided self\-report data, analysis of which indicated that over 71% said they used the teacher development videos every week and over 80% said they used EIA activities in the classroom every week. Government Education Officers observed 4,727 classrooms during this time and found that that 61% of students were seen using English in more than 50% of their talk\-time, with 86% of lessons including pair and group work **\[C3\]**. Systematic timed observations of 346 lessons by the 2014\-2015 cohort of teachers, showed similar changes in practice. The results show that both primary and secondary teachers are using a wide range of activities in the classroom and involving students in these activities. In this study, primary teachers were found to be organising 33% of the time, presenting 29% of the time, asking questions 18% of the time, and giving feedback 19% of the time. Secondary teachers were found to be organising 27% of the time, presenting 38% of the time, asking questions 21% of the time, and giving feedback 15% of the time. This is a change from the baseline study where teachers were observed to be primarily reading from the textbook and rarely involving students in activities **\[C4\]**. For 2015\-2016 teachers, a quasi\-experimental study \(including 163 systematic timed lesson observations\) found statistically significant experimental effects after only six months, just half\-way through the treatment. Primary and secondary teachers spent less time ‘presenting’ to students \(effect size r=0.2\); student\-student talk \(pair and group\) increased fourfold in primary lessons, from 4%pts to 16%pts \(effect size r=0.3\); whilst in secondary lessons, teachers and students both used more spoken English \(effect size 0.2\) **\[C5\]**. At a Divisional workshop in Rajshahi in August 2017, participants confirmed sustained use of the EIA interactive teaching activities and learners’ increased participation in the classes: *“Before EIA, I never used body language, acting and dancing in the classroom. I thought this was only for male teachers \[…\] that it was not for me. Now I use songs, rhymes, miming, acting, dancing. I feel very efficient in my work. My student teams are standing out in crowd at education and digital fairs. This is thanks to EIA. I changed myself and my sub\-district”* \(teacher participating in Rajshahi Divisional Workshop, 23.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. 

 **ii\) Improving the English language Competence of students** 

 There is large\-scale evidence for an improvement in learning outcomes for students who are taught by teachers who have engaged with EIA. Over 1,000 students \(579 primary, 480 secondary\) from the 2014 cohort took part in an end\-line study of English Language Competence \(ELC\), carried out by independent assessors. There were statistically significant differences showing substantial improvements over baseline for both primary and secondary students. For primary students, the pass\-rate rose 34.4%pts from 35.2% to 69.6%, whilst for secondary students, the pass\-rate rose 8.3%pts, from 74.5% to 82.8% **\[C6\]**. For 2015\-2016 students, a quasi\-experimental study \(1,802 students in pre\- and post\-test\) was conducted after only six months, just half\-way through the treatment. In treatment schools, the differences between pre\- and post\-test ELC were larger than in control schools \(rising by 0.3 Graded Examination in Spoken English \(GESE\) grades in treatment, compared to 0.2 grades in control\), but at this early stage the differences were not yet statistically significant. However, there were small\-to\-medium sized experimental effects for rural secondary students \(r=0.2\) and urban primary students \(r=0.2\) **\[C5\]**. Discussions with various stakeholders also indicate that teachers acknowledge that being in an EIA school has increased students’ confidence and proficiency in using English, in the classroom and among themselves: *“I visited 2\-3 classes in EIA schools in Manikgonj district. EIA is very fine; secondary students were spontaneously talking to us; students spoke English very fluently. In Bangladesh, children’s attitude towards English has changed. They have a courage for English and think that they can answer all questions. EIA has contributed to this. Students’ English results have also improved in the recent years. EIA has contributed to this”* \(Director \- Secondary at Department of Schools and Higher Education \(DSHE\), 21.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. 

 **iii\) Shaping the content of English language teaching curriculum materials in Bangladesh** 

 The EIA Programme team has influenced both primary and secondary curriculum in Bangladesh through its contributions to the work of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board \(NCTB\) in Bangladesh. BMB Mott MacDonald \(lead partner on EIA\) conducted two studies that produced recommendations, and the textbooks for primary schools were revised to implement these. EIA then helped review the new textbooks for primary teachers, grades one to five with regards to English language teaching. EIA worked with the Centre for British Teachers, who worked with NCTB, on the textbooks. The textbook revisions included the referencing of EIA classroom audios, where relevant to particular lessons. The new textbooks were distributed to teachers in 2013 \(grades one to three\) and 2015 \(grades four to five\). All teachers received EIA classroom audio recordings, as part of the NCTB’s distribution of the revised textbooks. The 2015 Terms of Reference for The NCTB Textbook Revision acknowledge EIA inputs into the English Textbooks for grades four to five **\[C1, C7\]**. ‘Teacher Editions’ are versions of the national textbook series that include instructional guides for teachers, on how to use the textbook content to support Communicative Language Teaching. In 2014, EIA technical experts contributed to writing all five Teacher Editions for English language primary teachers \(grades one to five\) **\[C8\]**. Content from EIA print materials \(i.e. *Activity Guides*\) were integrated into the Teacher Editions, particularly where they gave guidance regarding how to integrate digital audio resources in classroom teaching of specific lesson content. The Teacher Editions were published in August 2016. By 2017 they had been provided in print to every primary school \(two per school\) and had been distributed to all local Education Offices. They were also made available in soft copy on the NCTB website **\[C1\]**. Commissioned by the NCTB, EIA produced 36 audio recordings of ‘English for Today’ listening texts that accompany the NCTB textbooks for all secondary grades. Together with EIA’s own audios, these audios were uploaded on the NCTB website **\[C1\]**. The National Curriculum Coordinator Committee approved the audios and in 2014 the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education \(DSHE\) issued a circular asking all District Education Officers and Upazila Secondary Education Officers to ensure every head teacher/principal of a secondary school downloaded and used EIA audio materials **\[C9\]**. 

 **iv\) Influencing approaches to teacher development programmes in Bangladesh** 

 EIA materials and models have been integrated into in\-service teacher development in Bangladesh through the Subject\-Based Training \(SBT\) in English and the Customised Training Programme\-English \(CTP\-E\). SBT was a six\-day face\-to\-face training for in\-service teachers managed by the Department of Primary Education \(DPE\). The SBT Manual integrated 23 EIA A/V materials, and interactive teaching/learning activities. EIA supported the production of a Guide for trainers \(including a DVD with EIA digital contents\), and the training of 112 ‘Master Trainers’. Between 2014 and 2017, 115,000 Bangladeshi teachers have undergone SBT\-English, giving EIA inputs a wide reach. SBT has since stopped and has been replaced by the CTP\-E. The government has engaged several EIA staff as consultants in the design of the English element of this programme and its supporting materials \(e.g. Training Manual\) and the programme has integrated some of EIAs core components. For example, use of ICT and online/offline A/V materials is a key focus with all the trainers and teachers getting access to EIA digital A/V materials \(17 EIA videos have been integrated with different sessions on different days\) **\[C1\]**. Furthermore, most of the Government’s Master Trainers \(MTs\) for the CTP\-E are people who have been oriented to EIA, including many of EIA’s teacher facilitators/teachers: “ *EIA human resource is our resource*” \(DPE Deputy Director, 24.8.2017\). Among the 31 pilot Master Trainers, 22 have been oriented/exposed to EIA **\[C1\]**. 

 **v\) Influencing teacher development programmes outside of Bangladesh** 

 Key stakeholders have testified that EIA has had an impact beyond Bangladesh: *“EIA added to the global knowledge and debate around teacher professional development, by proposing a specific model based on 5 elements and by putting teachers at the centre of the classroom and evidencing what works in the classroom and to build teachers’ capacities”* \(DFID Education Adviser, 24.8.2017\) **\[C1\]**. One example of the global impact of EIA is the Teacher Development Programme \(TDP\) in Nigeria. TDP, funded by DFID \(2013\-2019\), was implemented in partnership with the Nigerian Federal Government and 5 Northern State Governments. It aimed to improve the quality of teaching for 62,000 teachers in primary and junior secondary schools and in Colleges of Education. Several EIA staff members were commissioned to work with TDP on the construction of materials such as a Facilitators Guide and a Head Teachers Guide. In addition, TDP has modelled its approach on EIA, in that both EIA and TDP are school\-based teacher professional development programmes, with a blend of self\-study and face\-to\-face training and support **\[C1\]**. In 2017 the scale and quality of impacts achieved by the EIA project were recognised through two awards: The Times Higher Education Supplement \(THES\) award for International Impact \(November 2017\) and the Pie\-oneer Award for Progressive Education Delivery in H.E \(September 2017\). The THES judges said that EIA was a: *“clear winner for its global impact on English communication abilities in difficult\-to\-access regions”.* They commended staff at the OU *for their: “innovative and pragmatic solution as well as their collaborative approach, working with intergovernmental agencies and in\-country partners” and stated that “The OU’s development of teaching materials specifically designed for use on low\-cost mobile phones has had a transformative impact on the regions in which they have been deployed”.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex sports research, by utilising novel physiological and biomechanical measurements in elite athletes, underpins changes in coaching and organisational practice, which result in improvements in elite athlete performance with associated cultural and economic impacts. This case study highlights **six examples** **within** **three elite sports** where Essex research has underpinned the impact. For **England Golf** and players of the **PGA European Tour** development, validation and implementation of new training, profiling and warm\-up protocols which were adopted by 100% of players, led to wins for all England golf squads at the Home Internationals and 2<sup>nd</sup> in the European Team Championships in 2018 and, since 2018, 12 players have won an event in PGA European Tour. For International field hockey teams \( **Team GB** & **Team USA**\) new training protocols improved sports performance in National, International and Olympic competitions \(Rio 2016\), with Team GB moving from bronze to Olympic gold and Team USA moving up from 12<sup>th</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup>. For elite **synchronised swimming** the use of novel physiological measurements had cultural impacts by being showcased in a multi\-award winning science documentary \( **NHK Japan**\) watched by 21.3 million people in Japan \(receiving six National and International awards\). For European high technology SME \( **Artinis Inc. Netherlands**\) the showcasing of the use of new equipment by Essex research in elite athletes resulted in economic impacts, increasing sales \(GBP 250,000\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The primary aim of the Essex Sports Performance Research Group is to provide evidence\-based research to understand, inform and drive improvements in athlete success; secondary aims include enabling economic activity arising from our research and facilitating public and cultural engagement in the science of sports performance. **This impact case study utilises six examples within three elite sports to highlight Essex research in this area:** 

 **Elite Golf** 

 From 2016 till present, Coughlan was a consultant with England Golf and the European Golf Tour. Therefore, even prior to publication, these organisations were able to apply his original research \(described below\) on elite golfers to inform their practice and improve performance. Coughlan’s work on athlete profiling in golf \[R1, R2\] revealed that the previous use of jump height to inform greater driving distance was flawed, due to its penalisation of high body mass; he showed that countermovement jump impulse or jump power are more strongly related to club head speed and should be used instead, especially when combined with medicine ball throws and isometric mid\-thigh pulls. In \[R2\] Coughlan further highlighted key physical attributes which should be assessed and relate to club head speed in high level youth golfers. Where previous research in this area had little impact, this unique publication was undertaken in a key developmental area with an elite cohort. It was therefore directly relevant to National Governing Bodies. In \[R3\] Coughlan demonstrated how a simple and player accessible, range based warm up could improve club head speed and shot quality, both important determinants in golf play outcomes. Research into this specific group of young elite athletes is rare and highlighted the usefulness of these tests when looking to improve club head speed. In \[R4\] Coughlan evidenced that training only once per week is sufficient to support meaningful changes in club head speed in youth golfers. Given the limited strength and conditioning time given to youth golfers, this finding into training dose and response held real and direct value for practitioners and players in terms of training effectiveness. 

 **Elite Hockey** 

 Cooper’s Near Infrared Spectroscopy \(NIRS\) research on elite athletes’ training adaptations following high intensity training led Team GB women’s field hockey’s strength and conditioning \(S&C\) coach to engage Essex to develop and validate new training approaches for Team GB hockey.  Cooper and Jones did so, reporting the first measurements of muscle oxygenation and haemodynamics in individual Olympic athletes in response to a sprint interval cycling training programme approach \[R5\]. This work was significant because the use of NIRS to detect training effects in response to exercise is usually reported as group data, within untrained or recreationally active cohorts. \[R5\] showed that NIRS can report on training induced changes in individual elite athletes and further how it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of future sport performance enhancing practices. Additionally, this work evidenced and validated the development of a low volume, time efficient, bike training protocol that led to enhanced muscle oxygen consumption; the subsequent increase in running performance in elite hockey players, was significant given the rarity of previous research evidencing such a performance effect in elite athletes. 

 **Underwater Physiology Measurements in Elite synchronised swimming** 

 NIRS technology had been exclusively used within “dry” applied sport & exercise fields, the lack of waterproofing preventing use in more challenging aquatic environments. In 2013, however, Cooper began the development, testing and *in vivo* validation of a new waterproof NIRS device, facilitating measurements in previously inaccessible exercise settings \[R6\]. The exemplar paper by Cooper and Jones \[R6\] showed that, using appropriate caution, adaptations could be made to NIRS devices that enabled underwater measurements equivalent to those on dry land. NIRS use was well tolerated and yielded interesting physiological measures during cold water immersion and sprint swimming in club level athletes and triathletes. This research therefore described the first use of NIRS to measure muscle oxygenation during swim exercise and enabled the future use of NIRS technology to provide novel physiological measurements in an aquatic environment.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We evidence six examples \( **highlighted in bold below**\) of our research’s impact within three elite sports: physical profiling and training interventions in golf research, both amateur \( **England Golf\)**\) and professional \( **PGA European Tour**\), changing organisational practice leading to enhanced performance; non\-invasive muscle optics physiological monitoring improving elite **Team GB** & **Team USA** hockey players’ performance; underwater NIRS use in synchronised swimmers  benefitting creativity, culture and society by enabling the  co\-creation of a new cultural artefact for **NHK Japan**; and research improving the economic performance of a business by contributing to entrepreneurial activity and improving existing products for **Artinis Inc**. 

 **England Golf and European Tour \- Research led to a change in organisational practice leading to improved sports performance** 

 **England Golf \[S1, S2\]** 

 Athlete profiling by Coughlan \[R1, R2\] revealed that the previous use of jump height to inform greater driving distance was flawed. England Golf consequently trained eleven staff in this area and now use isometric mid\-thigh pulls and countermovement jump to profile all of their National players and medicine ball throws and countermovement jump power to profile all regional players. The demonstration in \[R3\] that a standardised warm up led to longer, more accurate drives led to its adoption by England Golf for all players in the England system. \[R4\] showed that even if youth golfers only train once per week, it has a meaningful positive impact on their club head speed and drive distance; this directly led England Golf to encourage all regional programmes to deliver face to face weekly S&C sessions. Equipment was purchased and all S&C staff trained to complete testing according to \[R1\] and interpret the results and provide training recommendations based on \[R3\] and \[R4\]. According to the Lead S&C Coach at England Golf, Essex “ *research has helped us define our programmes sport science support*” \[S1\]. 

 Coughlan then collaborated with England Golf to develop new physical profiling protocols \[S2\]. In profiling, England Golf now require all S&C staff working with national players and players in regional squads to complete physical profiling using key measures from \[R1\] & \[R2\] \[S2\]. They add “ *profiling tests from your first study looking into the physical characteristics of players have been incorporated across all regional squads, with 100% uptake. These profiling tests are now used across \~200 regional under 18 players twice annually and have been since 2017. The results from the profiling are being used to provide training goals and specific training recommendations to all regional players and form a significant part of how we evaluate the effectiveness of our regional strength and conditioning support”* \[S2\] *.* They noted *“100% of our 40 national level players complete these profiling tests twice annually, from which they receive specific training advice to advance their performance*” \[S2\]. 

 In terms of warm up, “ *your research into the effectiveness of warm\-up in golf \[R3\] has been used as the foundation for our nation\-wide approach to warm\-up education for the players in both regional and national squads \[S2\]. All players \(\~240 across the programme\) are taught the warm\-up used in your study \[R3\] when they enter our pathway and are expected to use that or variants of that warm\-up throughout the competitive season*” \[S2\]. 

 In S&C, “ *your research into the effectiveness of strength and conditioning training \[R4\] has helped us to develop and justify resourcing strength and conditioning coaches to deliver once\-weekly sessions for players in the regional programme. This is now our preferred delivery strategy, especially in the off\-season*” \[S2\]. 

 In terms of performance outcomes, England Golf have noticed a dramatic increase in success following the policy changes introduced as a result of the recommendations in \[R1\-R4\]: “ *Over the past year \[to July 2020\], we have had incredible success as a nation, including wins for all squads \(Women’s, Girls’, Men’s and Boys’\) at the Home Internationals and placing 2<sup>nd</sup> in the European Team Championships* *Our players are hitting the ball further; we are seeing injuries less frequently and we are commonly observing more positive training and warm\-up behaviours*” \[S2\]. The research “ *played a significant part in achieving the world leading success England Golf has enjoyed and had it not been for your work the quality of our sports science support and results achieved would not have been possible. This research has allowed us to gain a major performance advantage on the international stage*” \[S2\]. 

 **European Tour \[S3, S4\].** 

 According to Director of the European Tour Performance Institute \(ETPI\) “ *In 2017, as a consequence of our discussions with Essex’s sports performance research team and on the basis of the evidence in their work, we began using a predicted countermovement jump peak power measure of explosive strength*” \[S3\]. Coughlan then collaborated with the Tour to develop new physical profiling protocols for ETPI, \[S4\], based on and referencing \[R1 & R2\]. Coughlan facilitated the implementation of his research to PGA European Tour members via ETPI so that they could implement the protocols outlined in \[R3\] and \[R4\]. Specifically ETPI “ *purchased the required equipment to mimic the testing methodologies used in your club head velocity and force paper. We took on contractors to supply strength and conditioning support to players, and you trained and supported them directly, so they could deliver the standardised profiling assessment used in your work*” \[S3\]. Profiling based on the recommendations from Essex research \[S4\] “ *is now offered free of charge, to all 650 players who compete under the PGA European Tour and its associated tournaments”* \[S3\]. 

 According to ETPI, Coughlan’s research directly resulted in “ *organisational level change and practitioner level change in practice regarding profiling and training for players*” \[S3\]. The increased knowledge gained about optimising golf physical preparation as a result of \[R1\-4\] and “ *helped inform the facilities we offer at events*” \[S3\]. Notably “ *at the 2018 and 2019 Open Championship as well as the victorious 2018 and up\-coming 2020 \[now 2021\] Ryder Cups, the PGA European Tour and R&A have provided and will continue to provide bespoke training facilities, tailored to the needs of players, based on your research*” \[S3\]. 

 ETPI have noted significant associated performance outcomes.  “ *During any given tournament, approximately 25% of the total field will have been through the physical profiling assessment to inform their training. Since 2018, 12 players have won an event following training recommendations directly related to the profiling they received. Most of the players we profile, who follow the tailored recommendations, report meaningful increases in their driving distance, which gives them an important competitive advantage*” \[S3\]. 

 **Elite Hockey Team GB \+ Team USA \(change in coach methods & teams’ performance\) \[S5\]** 

 Seeking to enhance the performance of Team GB women’s field hockey, their S&C coach contacted Essex in 2013 to explore the use of NIRS to test new training adaptations and devise a protocol for them prior to the 2016 Rio Olympics \[S5\]. They were especially interested in Cooper’s previous use of NIRS in research testing performance in elite rugby players: “ *the use of off\-feet \(bike\) training had resulted in both performance and peripheral muscle adaptions, suggesting that such an additional training load can be introduced without the need for impact \(run\) training*” \[S5\]. Crucially, Essex research had demonstrated that “ *bike training can yield improvements in such \[elite\] athletes*” and that “ *the use of NIRS analysis meant that information could be obtained at the peripheral level, which is of interest to a practitioner like me*” \[S5\]. In collaboration with Team GB women’s field hockey, a specific training programme was devised and validated by Cooper’s research, subsequently published in \[R5\]. The new training methods were implemented in Team GB hockey players from 2014 onwards. This had a “ *notable effect on the player’s physical capacity*”, “ *increased the player’s final running velocity*” and “ *capacity to undertake more high intensity efforts*”, which the coach believed was “ *a key determinant in winning matches*” \[S5\]. Crucially “ *the players did not experience injuries or overtraining as a consequence*” \[S5\]. This Essex research changed the S&C coach’s whole “ *approach to training regimes for high intensity efforts*” \[S5\]. When he subsequently moved to be Head of Performance Science for Team USA women field hockey, they “ *implemented training protocols from 2014\-2016 based upon University of Essex research*” that “ *resulted in notable improvement in the players capacity to improve high intensity efforts and thereby increased their ability to sway decisive points to their advantage. During this time the team improved, raising their Olympic performance from 12th in London 2012 to 5th in Rio 2016, earning fourth place at the 2014 World Cup and winning the gold medal in the FIH \(Federation Internationale Hockey\) championship challenge in May 2014. Performance gains in elite athletes already near their limits are hard to achieve, nevertheless, the insights from working with your group gave us such advantages*” \[S5\]. 

 The “novel insights” \[S5\] from Essex research \[R5\] therefore improved a coach’s approach, leading to changes in training programmes for two national field hockey teams. Indeed, without Essex’s contribution these teams “ *would have lacked an advantage in a critical aspect of their performance for international competition*s” \[S5\]. 

 **Enabling physiological measurements in elite synchronised swimmers:  impact on creativity, culture and society by co\-creating TV programme \(new cultural artefact\) \[S6\-8\]** 

 The demonstration by Cooper and Jones that NIRS could be used successfully underwater \[R6\] directly led the Production Research Manager from Japan's national broadcasting organization \(NHK\) to contact Cooper in January 2016 to discuss aiding with the scientific content for a new TV programme \- “Russia’s Golden Mermaids”. This formed part of the Japanese public broadcaster NHK’s highly successful “Miracle Body” Series focussing on the science underpinning performance in elite synchronised swimming \[S6\]. Jones continued these discussions; assisted with the planning of the programme; personally took the oxygenation measurements on the muscle and brains of swimmers in Tokyo and Barcelona that featured extensively as key visuals in the programme \[S7\]; and explained the meaning of the data to the production team and on camera to the TV audience. As noted by Konishi “ *Ben was invaluable to us not only for the data acquisition but also in interpreting the data obtained from these tests*” \[S6\]. His analysis featured extensively in the finished programme as helping “ *immensely in translating scientific methodology and analysis into language which could be appreciated by our general public audience*” \[S6\]. NHK considered the programme highly successful as it received above average viewing figures for a NHK special documentary of 6.6% \(9.9 million\) in the Kanto \(around Tokyo\) area, and 7.6% \(11.4 million\) in the Kansai area and was syndicated in six other countries \[S6\]. “Russia’s Golden Mermaids was praised by critics winning six national and international awards \[S6\], most noticeably the Takayanagi Grand Prix Prize for best TV science documentary prize in Japan \(2016\), the “Silver Screen”. In the year following the documentary \(2017\), the Japanese Swimming Federation saw a 5% increase in registered synchronised swimmers, against a backdrop of a fall in other registered swimmers \[S6, S8 p11\]. 

 **Artinis Inc.  economic impact via contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity and improving the performance of a business through improvement of existing products \[S9\]** 

 Artinis Inc. \(established 2002\) are a Dutch SME with approximately 50 employees that manufacture innovative NIRS systems for muscle and brain oxygenation measurements. For over 10 years they have had a close working collaboration with Cooper and Jones and the CEO notes that “ *The University of Essex research group have been instrumental in our product design and algorithm” and the collaboration has led to “innovative product design and advancement*” \[S9\]. Artinis consider Cooper’s research team “ *world leading in the applied work that they conduct*” with Artinis products \[S9\] and when contacted by potential customers “ *we always mention the special work by the University of Essex in speed skating, sport and elite sport*”. The company uses Essex research on elite athletes \(e.g. \[R5\] as marketing\) to enhance sales of their muscle Portamon device. Additional markets were opened by the demonstration that University of Essex modifications of Artinis devices enabled their successful use underwater, both in club athletes \[R6\] and elite synchronised swimmers \(see NHK documentary above\). Artinis note that “ *As with all new products, market introduction is difficult*” but that highlighting the research of Cooper’s group “ *aided with the marketing process*”. The research “ *aided in product requests and sales that have benefited the company demonstrably*”, “ *increased sales rates in the region of GBP 250,000, which has enabled company growth and increased company employment*” \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Human papillomavirus \(HPV\), a common sexually transmitted infection, which has no treatment, causes \~5% of cancers \(e.g., cervical, anal, oropharyngeal\). Since 2008, the UK has offered HPV vaccination to girls, and, after much lobbying, to boys from Sept 2019. Sherman’s programme of research, developed with clinicians and charities, contributed to the government’s u\-turn over gender neutral HPV vaccination and underpins European guidance. It has informed healthcare professional \(HCP\) education, leading to the revision of Public Health England \(PHE\) materials and has been used to educate the public about HPV through media engagement and informing charity and health authority communication strategy.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Sherman, Senior Lecturer and academic lead for the School of Psychology’s Health and Wellbeing Research Group \(HWB\), has conducted research into issues surrounding knowledge about HPV and related conditions for the past 9 years. HWB promotes collaborative research: members work with clinicians, charity representatives, academics, and patients, both nationally and internationally. Sherman’s work focuses on how improving knowledge in HCPs, parents of teenage children, and women can increase engagement with vaccination and screening. 

 The underpinning research emerged during a highly charged political debate in the UK about extending HPV vaccination to boys. Simultaneously, the NHS cervical screening programme \(NHSCSP\) piloted, then rolled out, HPV testing as primary screening to replace cytology \(examining cervical cells for pre\-cancerous changes\). Sherman’s research provided a solid evidence base on public and HCP knowledge about HPV and attitudes towards these changes to inform communication and implementation. It continues to inform the roll\-out of gender\-neutral vaccination across Europe. 

  

 <ins>HPV and HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 Sherman’s Wellcome\-funded study in PLOS ONE \( **3.1**\) demonstrated: a\) only 50% of parents sampled have heard of HPV, and only 50% have heard of the HPV vaccine, b\) before receiving information about the vaccine most of the 50% who had heard of it wanted it to be available for boys, c\) after brief information was provided to the entire cohort \(including those who had not previously heard of it\) most parents thought the vaccine should be extended to boys. This was the first UK study to find out what parents know about HPV and males and what they think about HPV vaccination for boys. It was influential because it demonstrated public demand for a vaccine but simultaneously a lack of public knowledge about the health consequences of HPV for males. 

 Sherman and Leicester NHS Trust colleagues published a systematic review exploring what European adolescents know about HPV and HPV vaccination \( **3.2**\). Knowledge about both HPV and the vaccination was suboptimal. Boys know less than girls, which has implications for engagement with gender\-neutral HPV vaccination as it is introduced across Europe. 

  

 <ins>HPV and cervical screening:</ins> 

 Working with gynaecological oncologists from Royal Stoke and Leicester NHS Trusts, and an epidemiologist from King’s College London, Sherman pitched to and published an article in the BMJ highlighting that 20% of new cervical cancer diagnoses and 50% of deaths in the UK are women aged 65\+ who are past the eligible age for cervical screening \( **3.3**\). This article attracted considerable attention nationally and internationally. 

  

 Sherman, alongside colleagues at Leicester NHS Trust, Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust \(Jo’s Trust\), and in New Zealand, conducted a series of surveys \( **3.4**, **3.5**\) to understand what HCPs know about HPV, HPV vaccination, and changes to the NHSCSP. The findings consistently reveal that while basic knowledge is satisfactory, gaps in knowledge exist, particularly regarding changes to the NHSCSP and knowledge of the health consequences of HPV for males. The main UK study \( **3.4**\) recruited 643 HCPs who had previously contacted Jo’s Trust and has been used to inform Jo’s Trust advocacy work and update PHE training materials.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sherman’s research has generated impact benefiting HCPs and the public by informing and influencing key partners involved in HPV vaccination and screening, including: PHE, Jo’s Trust and HPV Action. Impact has been achieved through inclusion in national and international materials and guidance documents, invited practitioner workshops and talks, and media engagement. 

1.  **Shaping government policy and decision making, UK, Europe, New Zealand** 

 <ins>HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 The European Cancer Organisation \(ECCO, 2019\) stated that “By 2030, gender\-neutral vaccination programmes against the HPV infection should be in place in all European countries”. Sherman’s research forms part of the evidence used to encourage governments to meet this goal. 

 In 2018, after 5 years of evidence gathering, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI\) advised the UK Government to extend the school\-based HPV vaccination programme to boys and the Government agreed. **3.1** findings were submitted to the public phase of the JCVI consultation and Peter Baker, Campaign Director of HPV Action, who spearheaded the successful campaign for gender\-neutral vaccination, confirms **3.1** “formed a significant part of the evidence base underpinning this policy change” **\(5.1\).**  The vaccination is estimated to benefit 400,000 boys annually. 

 Currently, 17 countries in Europe lack gender\-neutral HPV vaccination. In 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published guidance about gender\-neutral and nonavalent HPV vaccination citing **3.2** as evidence **\(5.2\).** 

 <ins>Cervical Screening:</ins> 

 Based on **3.6**, a New Zealand National Cervical Screening Programme \(NCSP\) report recommended that the NCSP continue to monitor cancer incidence trends in women under 30, with an emphasis on “engaging women with a high coverage rate at age 25” **\(5.3\).** 

1.  **Improving HCP knowledge** 

 <ins>HPV and HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 Following **3.3**, Nursing in Practice \(circulation:12,000\), commissioned an article with learning points about HPV from Sherman **\(5.4\).** Sherman gave an invited gender\-neutral HPV vaccination workshop at the 2019 School and Public Health Nurses Association conference. Greater Manchester Health & Social Care Partnership \(GMHSCP\) invited Sherman to present at their Universal HPV vaccination launch event **\(5.5\).** 80\-100% of respondents from each event said they had/intended to use the information to inform their own practice and to disseminate the information further. 

 **3.4** was cited as underpinning evidence for a call to improve public and professional awareness and education about HPV in a major report by ECCO urging action to reduce the annual 87,000 HPV\-related cancers across 50 countries **\(5.6\).** 

 <ins>HPV and cervical screening:</ins> 

 Jo’s Trust use **3.4** to advocate for and deliver training to HCPs **\(5.7\)** and PHE used **3.4** to update smear taker online training materials \(see screenshot\). 



1.  **Raising public awareness and improving understanding** 

 PHE \(2017\) seeks to halt declining cervical screening numbers and protect against future fluctuations in HPV vaccination. Public knowledge and awareness about HPV, vaccination, and screening are important to ensure optimal engagement with the programmes. A campaign of media activity \(2015\-2020\) has led to Sherman’s research being disseminated to over 20 million people **\(5.9\)** and it has informed NHS and charity communications. 

 <ins>HPV and HPV Vaccination:</ins> 

 **3.1** informed development of the GMHSCP communication strategy for the expansion of the HPV vaccine programme to boys **\(5.5\)** and informed Jo’s Trust’s interactions with the 4 nations’ national screening programmes to advocate for language around gender\-neutral vaccination **\(5.7\).** Following **3.1**, Peter Baker \(HPV Action\) invited Sherman onto the expert advisory group which helped develop the website launched to inform the public about male HPV vaccination **\(5.1\).** 

 A Conversation article **\(5.8\)** about **3.1** received 7,082 readers, 23 comments, 70 retweets, 247 Facebook shares, was republished by Medical Xpress, and Radio Stoke \(weekly audience 121,000\) interviewed Sherman about the research. Following publication of **3.4** and the announcement of universal HPV vaccination, further media interviews took place **\(5.9\).** Social media activity around Sherman’s publications indicate considerable reach. **3.1:** 82 tweets from 59 users, reach\-404,522; **3.2:** 42 tweets from 22 users, reach\-58,915 \(Altmetric\). 

 <ins>HPV and cervical screening:</ins> 

 **3.3** received extensive national and international media coverage during Cervical Screening Awareness Week, including the Today Programme, Woman's Hour, BBC 5 Live \(combined daily listeners: 8 million\), national print newspapers including the Metro, Daily Mirror, i, Daily Express, Independent, Telegraph, Times, frontpage of The Scotsman \(combined daily readership, 2015: 3.3 million\) **\(5.9\),** and a BBC Breakfast Show interview **\(5.9\)**. There were 40\+ pieces of regional coverage, international coverage in 14\+ countries and the BMJ identified it as one of their biggest stories of 2015 **\(5.10\).** Jo’s Trust confirmed that **3.3** significantly amplified their own awareness campaign and has been influential in focusing a spotlight on the issue of cervical screening for older women **\(5.7\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The research underpinning this case study identified five key elements of an effective strategy for developing reading for pleasure within primary schools. This has resulted in impacts on the **understanding and learning** and **practice** of 308 primary schools, 5,320 primary school practitioners \(and their pupils\), 30 Initial Teacher Education Providers and 3,858 student teachers and on **public policy** by influencing five national Reading for Pleasure initiatives. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Reading for Pleasure \(RfP\) programme of research at the OU seeks to address recurring evidence that children in England enjoy reading less than their international peers and engage less often. Yet although RfP is now mandated in schools, reading improvement initiatives are often focused on increasing proficiency rather than sustaining engagement by nurturing readers. The RfP research has documented weaknesses in supporting reading for pleasure within schools, including for disadvantaged children and RfP researchers have worked with teachers to identify the key elements of an effective reading for pleasure strategy. Taken as a whole, the research revealed that: i\) teachers’ knowledge of children’s literature is too limited to enable reader development or respond to diverse children; ii\) that the diversity of children’s informal multimedia reading practices at home is underestimated by teachers; iii\) that reading and talk are mutually supportive learning experiences for children and adults. The work argued that to effectively develop children’s reading for pleasure, teachers need to develop: a\) considerable knowledge of children’s literature and other texts; b\) knowledge of children’s reading practices; c\) a reading for pleasure pedagogy, encompassing social reading environments; reading aloud; informal book talk and recommendations; d\) independent reading time; e\) an identity as ‘Reading Teachers’\- teachers who read and readers who teach and f\) reciprocal and interactive reading communities within and beyond school. 

 A survey was conducted of 1,200 teachers’ personal and professional reading practices. The research revealed that teachers have limited knowledge of children’s authors, poets and picture fiction creators and instead rely upon childhood favourites and ‘celebrity’ authors. This limited knowledge impacts on their ability to foster reading for pleasure and reader development amongst pupils **\[O1\]**. A second study involved teacher–researchers from five Local Authorities documenting and developing their own and children’s reading practices and identities **\[O2, O3\]**. Results identified that: developing teachers’ knowledge of children’s literature positively impacts upon pedagogic practice, reader to reader relationships and the creation of reading communities; teachers who develop their knowledge of children’s reading practices widen what counts as reading in their classrooms, which engages children, whose everyday reading are respected; a robust RfP pedagogy encompasses four specific practices: reading aloud, informal book\-talk and recommendations, and independent reading time within a highly social reading environment. When responsively combined they make a positive impact on children’s RfP; teachers who explore their own reading practices develop a wider conceptualisation of reading and of the social nature of reading, this influences their pedagogy and impacts upon children’s reading for pleasure. In schools that developed these practices a shift in the locus of control around reading and the creation of newly interactive and highly reciprocal reading communities was observed. A third study involved 18 teachers from five Local Authorities adopting an ethnographic stance and visiting homes, researching children’s literacy lives and building on their new understandings in school **\[O3\]**. This research identified an urgent need to align professional understandings with the lived experiences of learners and to broaden what is valued as literacy in school. It argued teachers should build on children’s funds of knowledge and create ‘two\-way traffic’ between home and school reading. Another study sought to identify the key features of extra\-curricular reading groups within the Carnegie and Kate Greenaway shadowing scheme **\[O4\]**. The research identified the groups as social reading environments that supported reading for pleasure. In addition, extensive book talk and teacher and librarian knowledge of texts was evidenced, enabling book recommendations to be made and reciprocity to develop in reader\- to\-reader relationships. Drawing on work which focused on developing an evaluation tool for digital books; 6 facets of reader engagement in relation to digital book apps were identified which expanded understanding about what teachers need to know about children’s everyday digital reading practices **\[O5\]**. Finally, RfP pedagogy within four case study low SES schools was investigated. The study found that within the schools RfP pedagogies did not support engagement as readers because teachers’ understandings of reading were primarily about proficiency. It argued that teachers need to reconceptualise reading as social and volitional and ensure their RfP pedagogies reflect this **\[O6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Impact has been developed by working with a range of beneficiaries including: 1\) Primary school practitioners with responsibility for reading including: English Subject Leaders, teachers, head\-teachers, school librarians, teaching assistants and external reading consultants or literacy specialists 2\) Initial Teacher Education stakeholders including teacher educators and student teachers 3\) The Department for Education and related government bodies with a role in developing reading skills in primary education. Two key pathways to impact the research team have developed are an interactive RfP website and Teachers’ Reading Groups \(TRGs\). Advised by a reference group of current teachers the RfP website hosts accessible resources which engage teachers with the OU research\-informed approach to effective RfP. Users can upload ‘Examples of Practice’ explicitly linking change in their RfP practice to the research. TRGs are local CPD\-focused groups run by volunteer leaders. The RfP research team support TRG leaders by offering training, mentoring and resources. Texts for the TRGs have been donated by the OU, UKLA and commercial publishers. TRG Members are supported to plan and implement changes to their practice as a result of their engagement with the research findings. Overall, these and other activities have had an impact on: 

-  **The understanding and learning** and **practice** of primary schools, primary school practitioners \(and their pupils\), Initial Teacher Education Providers and student teachers by transforming whole school RfP practice; shaping RfP related Initial Teacher Education provision; and influencing pupils reading practices and attainment. 

-  **public policy** of Department for Education and related bodies who have a responsibility for developing reading skills in primary education by influencing national RfP initiatives. 

 **Transformed whole\-school RfP practice:** Between 2018 and 2020, **69 schools** have paid for sustained support from the RfP team who have worked with the English Lead, Head Teacher, and change management team to develop their RfP practices. In 2018\-2019 in Macclesfield, the RfP team worked with The Aspirer Teaching Alliance to support development across five schools. In the West Midlands they worked with the Birmingham Diocesan Multi\-Academy Trust \(BDMAT\) to support development across eight schools. In 2019\-20 the RfP team worked with eight Nottingham and eight Birmingham schools, in 2020\-2021 with 27 Sheffield and Rotherham schools, linked to St Wilfred’s English Hub, and a further 13 Birmingham schools. Development days were held to enable staff from participating schools, including teachers, teaching assistants, senior leaders, and head teachers, to engage with the research \(approx.1,500 practitioners in total\). Consequently, RfP Lead Teachers have developed ‘Action Plans’ for their school and individual teachers have planned change to their practice. End of year one evaluation data from across the Aspirer and BDMAT Trusts revealed that 96% indicated that the RfP research had considerably influenced their own and their staff’s RfP pedagogy **\[C1\]**. At the end of year school conference, teachers from schools in the Aspirer Trust shared the practices they employed to engage the whole staff team with the RfP research such as including examples from the RfP website on the agenda for every staff meeting **\[C1\]**. Examples of whole\-school practices adopted by one of these schools, Puss Bank School and Nursery, include: teachers taking time to share their reading preferences and habits with their classes, teachers creating a ‘book door’ leading into their classroom and introducing birthday book gifting **\[C1\]**. The Head teacher of Peover Superior Endowed Primary School describes how engaging in RfP research started a ripple\-effect within the School and Trust leading to outcomes such as an NQT winning a RfP Teacher of the Year award and the head\-teacher offering RfP in\-service training to eight other schools within the wider Trust **\[C2\]**. The RfP team is currently working with **34 government funded English Hubs** and their 170 English Leaders \(each Hub works with 120 schools in high challenge areas\) by contributing to the Hub training programme. In 2020, 141 Leaders attended five RfP training sessions led by Cremin in London, Wilmslow, Wakefield, and Bristol. After the training, 85% of attendees reported that they intended to implement what they had learnt, with examples including: ‘ *staff training on not killing stories’* and ‘ *getting to know my children really well’*. The person responsible for leading training across the Hubs testifies that the RfP research has “ *enriched teachers’ understanding of why and how they should put reading for pleasure at the heart of their schools*” **\[C3\]**. The Strategic Lead for the English Hub covering North East London and Essex testifies that they run a TRG group with 18 school representatives and that evaluation responses are very positive with all participants reporting that “ *it had already transformed \(or was transforming\) the teaching of Reading for Pleasure in their school*” **\[C3\]**. Further evidence of impact on whole school practice can be found in testimonials from **school leaders**. For example, at St Mathews C.E Teaching and Research School, RfP is embedded through activities such as introducing ‘reading aloud’ at the end of every day, incorporating Reading for Pleasure weeks on a two\-week cycle and training teachers on understanding the pedagogy behind RfP **\[C2\]**. Sneiton St Stephens Church of England Primary School have responded to the RfP research by making sure everybody \(including the caretaker\) was reading more current children’s literature; doing a ‘book swap’ for children on a Monday morning in the hall before school and holding reading assemblies which parents are invited to **\[C2\]**. At the University of Cambridge Primary School an RfP culture has been developed through setting up a TRG group for teachers and learning coaches, establishing a separate ‘parents RfP’ group with 20 parents, running workshops for parents and developing a RfP professional development course for 50\-60 practitioners from 20 schools **\[C2\]**. The RfP research has informed whole\-school approaches in a further 67 schools, as evidenced by the **case studies** of whole\-school change that have been uploaded to the RfP website by teachers \[https://tinyurl.com/ya48rfkb\]. For example, a teacher at Moorlands Primary Academy describes how they recruited 35 staff to become ‘reading buddies’ to less experienced readers in the school and how this has led to “significantly more book talk around the school”. 

 **Shaped RfP related Initial Teacher Education provision:** Since 2016, the RfP team have partnered with 30 Initial Teacher Education providers including Edge Hill University, Cardiff University, University of Glasgow, Sheffield Hallam, Roehampton, University of the West of England, and St Mary’s University College Belfast. The RfP team supports them in using RfP findings within their teaching materials, activities, or assignments. In addition, 14 universities have established their own TRG groups for ITE students, or in combination with local teachers. At the University of Greenwich, RfP is embedded in the BA QTS course \(500 students since 2017\); School Direct \(80 since 2017\); the PGCE \(360 since 2017\) and CPD in 11 schools has been run. In Year 3, a specialist course is run for around 20 students per year who want to develop their RfP practice, where they either examine their understanding of children’s books or their own identity as a reader **\[C4\]**. The University of Roehampton directs students to the RfP website to inform their developing practice and Year 2 BA QTS students \(320 per year\) are tasked to undertake a RfP case study during their placement. A senior English lecturer testifies how engagement with RfP has also influenced her own practice and the RfP ethos of 40 other staff at Roehampton, with examples including staff having posters on their doors to identify what they are currently reading **\[C4\]**. At the University of the West of England, the RfP research is shared with first year students and PGCE students \(660 students since 2018\). First year students focus on RfP as part of their placement and, drawing on RfP research, write an assignment that reflects on the effective teaching of reading **\[C4\]**. A 2019 survey of 20 partner Initial Teacher Education providers working with student teachers from a range of courses revealed that RfP research findings had been shared with 4,300 students and developed with 1,238 students. Regarding the impact of the RfP research on students, respondents felt there had been an impact: on students’ knowledge of children’s literature and other texts \(82% agreeing or strongly agreeing\); on RfP pedagogy in terms of social reading environments \(94% agreeing or strongly agreeing\), Reading Teachers \(94% agreeing or strongly agreeing\), reading aloud \(88% agreeing or strongly agreeing\) and independent reading \(82% agreeing or strongly agreeing\); and on reading communities \(71% agreeing or strongly agreeing\) **\[C5\]**. 

 **Transformed primary school practitioners understanding and implementation of RfP:** 

 To date around 450 detailed accounts of RfP practice that has been influenced by OU RfP research have been uploaded to the RfP website by teachers, librarians, teacher educators and student teachers from over 25 schools in England \(e.g. Bexley, Birmingham, Cambridge, Coventry, Dagenham, Grimsby, London, Northampton, Macclesfield, Manchester, Margate, Rochdale, Weston\-Supermare & York\) Wales, Republic of Ireland, Dubai and Pakistan \[https://tinyurl.com/ya48rfkb\]. Since 2017, the RfP team have supported 200 ‘Teachers and Reading Groups’ \(TRGs\) across the UK and 4 international groups, involving approximately 3,600 members, who collectively are teaching approximately 900,000 pupils. A 2019 survey of 63 TRG leaders and 357 TRG members revealed that engagement in the RfP research had influenced TRG members knowledge and understanding of: children’s literature and other texts \(91%\), children’s reading practices \(85%\); RfP pedagogy\-social environments \(81%\); RfP pedagogy\-reading aloud \(74%\); RfP pedagogy\- independent reading \(75%\); RfP pedagogy\-informal book talk \(85%\); Reading teachers \(87%\) and reading communities \(89%\). TRG leaders indicate that this had contributed to an increase in confidence and a sense of being empowered to make changes in practice. TRG members also report impacts on their own knowledge and practice. For example: “ *My attitude towards it \[RfP pedagogy\] and awareness of the importance of it has changed my practice*” \(literacy lead, KS1\) and “ *it \[the TRG\] has kept me focused on my aims and ensured I kept up with what I have wanted to achieve*” \(literacy lead, KS2\) **\[C6\]**. A TRG leader in Rochdale testifies that as a result of attending the training and becoming a TRG leader they i\) invited the Mayor and head of the Royal British Legion into school to read stories to the school’s most vulnerable children; ii\) started the Rochdale Children’s Literature festival with 8 TRG members which involved pupils as festival ambassadors; and iii\) buddied up less experienced readers with members of staff **\[C2\]**. 

 **Influenced pupils’ reading practices and attainment:** Practitioner uploads of practice case studies to the RfP website, school evaluations and practitioner testimonials highlight pupils are more enthusiastic, willing, and able to voice their views about books and identify themselves as readers. Their perceptions of why we read have changed from predominantly functional to pleasurable. For example, responses to the 2019 TRG member survey included: “ *some Year 2 boys formed their own book club in the playground where they were sharing books by the same author*” **\[C6**\]. St. Matthew's C.E. Teaching and Research School reports that: “ *we’ve found that that engagement with RfP \[…\] has enabled our children to really take on board any type of reading that they do across the curriculum*” **\[C2\]**. A teacher from University Cambridge Primary testifies: “ *the RfP work was instrumental in helping us create that culture which has transformed children’s lives*”. They described how a Year 6 boy who’d hated reading in Year 2 asked if he could “ *run an intervention group with Year 1 children who find it difficult to read*” **\[C2\]**.  Elmhurst Primary School reports that in 2019 the number of pupils reaching the ‘Higher standard’ increased from 30% to 43% **\[C3\]**. Whole\-school data from schools in the BDMA and Aspire Trusts shows significant shifts in readers’ attitudes through baseline/end\-of\-year surveys. For example, a shift from 44% to 97% KS1 students liking reading at Victoria Road Primary School; a shift from 3% to 60% KS2 students liking reading at Coleshill Church of England Primary School\) and 50% to 75% KS1 and KS2 students liking reading at Nethersole Church of England Academy **\[C1\]**. 

 **Influenced national RfP initiatives:** The scale and quality of impact of the RfP research has been recognised by the Department for Education \(DfE\) who during the pandemic invited Cremin to advise on the Reading for Pleasure component of the BBC BiteSize resources which were created to support home\-schooling and to work with the Oak National Academy to produce a daily reading curriculum for 5 to16 year olds for 2020\-2021. In addition, at the request of the DfE, Cremin has developed a tool for Schools to audit their RfP practice. Linked to this work Cremin has been asked to Chair the DfE RfP subcommittee and has been asked by the Minister of State for School Standards to serve as one of three ‘reading experts’ on the English Hubs Council programme **\[C7\]**. These appointments have enabled Cremin to make a significant contribution to the initiation and launch of the first National Reading Together Day \(16/07/2020\). Co\-ordinated by the Reading Agency, the aim of the event was to encourage families and young people to read together by participating in a shared schedule of events **\[C7\]**. Cremin also initiated an OU RfP partnership with the Reading Agency to launch a Teachers Reading Challenge \(Aug to Oct 2020\). \[https://teachersreadingchallenge.org.uk/\]. The 2,500 teachers who signed up to the Challenge were supported to use the OU RfP pedagogy to source book recommendations, take part in discussions and produce and share 2,000 book reviews. Commenting on the success of all the initiatives outlined here, the DfE English Hubs Policy Team Leader concludes that the RfP research has played a “ *a highly important and influential role on our policy\-making, which has resulted in excellent outputs such as the Reading Together Day and various helpful documents, products and tools for schools across the country”* **\[C7\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Galligan’s research on women’s political representation played an important role in the introduction of mandatory gender quotas in general elections in the Republic of Ireland. These helped lead to a doubling of the proportion of female *candidates* and a 48% rise in the proportion of women *elected representatives* in the 2016 Irish general election, and there were further increases at the 2020 general election. A rise in women’s representation in the 2019 Irish local government election can also be attributed, in part, to the indirect impact of mandatory quotas. In addition, Galligan’s research had a significant beneficial impact on the policies and practice of one major political party, Fianna Fáil, through the work of a commission on women’s representation chaired by Galligan. Finally, Galligan’s research also led to the establishment of a women’s caucus at the Northern Ireland Assembly and, indirectly, to the setting up of a similar body in the Irish parliament. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Galligan has published widely on the democratic problem of women's under\-representation in Ireland. In research articles, public presentations and commissioned reports for political parties, she has developed a case for the use of gender quotas in political and public settings as a means of addressing the persistent gender deficit in public decision\-making in the country. 

 In the early 2000s, Galligan \(with Kathleen Knight of Columbia University and Una Nic Giolla Choille of Trinity College, Dublin\) played a leading role in a research study on women’s underrepresentation in Irish politics. The research examined elected women representatives' experience of political life and the attitudes of women political elites in Ireland toward positive action initiatives that would assist in increasing women's legislative presence. This study, which was based on a survey of the views of both current and retired female elected representatives, was the first systematic research in Ireland conducted on female politicians' views on the measures needed to support women's political ambitions and careers. The survey found majority support among Irish female elected representatives \(current and retired\) for a legal requirement that Irish political parties should field a minimum percentage of women candidates \[1\]. 

 In \[2\], Galligan provided a comprehensive review of what she referred to as the “glacial” pace of progress in addressing the under\-representation of women in Irish politics. This review, published in 2009, presented a wealth of data on women’s under\-representation. Galligan concluded that political parties would need to take “strong affirmative action” measures in order to make any significant progress on the issue. 

 In \[3\], published in 2006, Galligan reviewed the relative effectiveness of the implementation of a range of gender quota options – both mandatory and voluntary. She concluded that, while voluntary quotas might appear to be more effective in some respects, they were vulnerable to the risk of abandonment. 

 She also highlighted the importance of female politicians joining forces, together with civil society representatives, to press for gender parity: 

 Coalition building to press for political parity has yielded particularly positive results ― sensitising society to gender equality, creating a climate accepting of gender equality norms, and providing political women with an important source of leverage in pursuit of parity claims.  The most effective and enduring strategies stem from a coalition of female politicians, women leaders and feminist activists \[3\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Galligan’s research can be seen in a number of critical developments which have taken place since August 2013. Firstly, in the considerable and very significant impact of legislation on gender quotas which her work helped to shape. This was most evident in the 2016 Irish general election but the legislation’s beneficial impact could also be seen in the 2020 Irish general election. Secondly, in the impact of a commission chaired by Galligan on the policies and practice of a major political party. Thirdly, in the indirect impact of the legislation on government policy and representation of women in the Irish 2019 local government election and, finally, in the impact of Galligan’s research on the establishment of women’s caucuses in the Oireachtas \(Irish Houses of Parliament\) and in the Northern Ireland Assembly. 

 **Impact of gender quota legislation: 2016 general election** 

 In 2012, the Electoral \(Amendment\) \(Political Funding\) Act was passed by the Oireachtas. This Act provided for a gender quota of 30%, rising to 40% at a later date, a measure which was directly influenced by Galligan’s research \[1\] and \[3\] \[A\]. A major aspect of the impact of her research from August 2013 onwards, reported here, derives from the impact of the relevant section of that Act. 

 For this reason, it is necessary to briefly trace how that link arises, even though the Act itself was passed during the previous REF impact period. On 9<sup>th</sup> September 2009, Galligan gave evidence to a joint Oireachtas committee which was investigating the issue of women’s participation in politics \[A\]. In its report, the committee drew extensively on Galligan’s oral submission, and on her published work \[A\]. Most notably, Galligan’s submission and research helped shape the sub\-committee’s recommendation that provisions should be made for a 33.3% female candidate quota, potentially rising thereafter. This recommendation, slightly adapted, was adopted in Section 42 of the Act \[A\]. 

 The first opportunity to put this legislation into practice arose with the 2016 General Election in Ireland. The legislation had considerable impact. There was a marked increase in both the proportion of candidates selected who were women and in the proportion of representatives who were actually elected. Overall, there was a doubling \(100% increase\) in the proportion of candidates who were women compared to the most recent 2011 General Election; 30% of the candidates who contested the election were women, compared to just 15% in 2011. The 2016 proportion was the highest ever percentage of female candidates for a general election in Ireland \[B\]. 

 Moreover, the impact of these changes in the gender of the candidates helped to bring about a significant change in the gender mix of the Dáil \(lower house and principal chamber of the Oireachtas\). There was a 48% increase in the proportion of women elected compared to 2011, meaning 22% of TDs \(Irish members of parliament\) elected were women, the highest proportion of women deputies in the history of the Irish state. Indeed, analysing these results, Buckley et al. conclude: 

 Without doubt, gender quotas contributed to an increase in women’s candidate selection and election in the 2016 general election. They helped create a cultural shift in political parties whereby women party members and their electoral ambitions were no longer overlooked \[B\]. 

 A leading Irish women’s organisation, the National Women’s Council of Ireland \(NWCI\) also publicly attributed the transformation to the introduction of gender quotas. Louise Glennon of the NWCI commented: 

 Gender quotas were necessary to accelerate the pace of change for women’s equality, and it is clear that they were successful. Progress wasn’t happening without quotas… \[C\] 

 **Impact of Markievicz Commission on party policy and practice** 

 Of the larger parties, Fianna Fáil oversaw the most spectacular transformation. No female Fianna Fáil candidates had been elected in 2011. However, in 2016, the party increased its proportion of women candidates by 111% and was successful in returning six female TDs. In order to help achieve this change, the party implemented a number of recommendations which were made by a special commission, the Markievicz Commission. 

 The Commission, which was chaired by Galligan and drew on Galligan’s research and expertise, was tasked with examining how the party could ensure greater female participation in politics. The Commission’s report was launched by the party’s leader, Micheál Martin TD, in January 2015.  He acknowledged the challenge which the report presented for the party: 

 … I am delighted with the work Professor Galligan and her colleagues on the Commission have carried out. It represents a constructive challenge to the entire party organisation which I am determined we will meet \[D\]. 

 The Commission’s report recommended a series of measures, including two which related specifically to the forthcoming 2016 general election campaign: 

1.  the party’s National Constituencies Committee should direct constituencies to select a woman where necessary 

1.  the party should ensure that it met the 30% minimum quota of female candidates \[E\] 

 These recommendations were fully implemented; party headquarters issued directives to its members in five constituencies, and 31% of the candidates selected overall were women \[F\]. In total, Fianna Fáil implemented 14 of the report’s 16 recommendations in full or in part; seven recommendations were implemented in full and seven further recommendations were implemented in part \[F\]. In addition, the Commission’s report was discussed at the party’s Ard Fheis \(annual conference\) and at all party branch meetings. The then President of the Fianna Fáil Women’s Network has described the report as being “very significant” in enabling the party to adopt a major change in policy and practice \[G\]. 

 **Impact in 2019 local government election and 2020 general election: women’s representation and government policy** 

 The success of the quota measure in the 2016 general election led to a call by the NWCI for the government to introduce a similar mandatory quota for the local government election in 2019 \[C\]. Although this did not happen, in 2019, the Irish government introduced a funding scheme to incentivise political parties to field more women candidates in the 2019 local government election, including a specific measure to incentivise parties to field at least 30% female candidates. While not a legal requirement, this was in line with the 2012 legislation and, according to the government, the use of the 30% threshold was influenced by that legislation \[H\]. 

 In that election, the proportion of female candidates rose significantly from 22% in the previous local government election in 2014 to 28% in 2019, while women as a proportion of elected candidates also rose, from 21% in 2014 to 24% \[I\]. 

 The following year, there was another general election which was held on 8<sup>th</sup> February, 2020. In that election, all the major parties met or exceeded the mandatory 30% quota, helping to ensure that the highest ever number of female candidates was fielded \[C\]. There was also a further slight increase in the proportion of women elected, to 23% \(from 22% in 2016\) \[J\]. 

 **Impact in Dáil and Northern Ireland Assembly: women’s caucuses** 

 Galligan’s work has also had a significant impact on the work of the Northern Ireland Assembly, although this was curtailed by the dissolution of the Assembly in January 2017. In March 2016, the Assembly launched a cross\-party Assembly Women’s Caucus \[K\]. The establishment of a Caucus was due, at least in part, to a submission from Galligan to a high\-level Assembly committee which, drawing on her work in \[3\] and elsewhere, advocated the establishment of an Assembly Women’s Caucus. The Committee’s report endorsed this and other recommendations from Galligan, and this led to the setting up of the Caucus \[L\]. According to the then Chair of the Caucus, Galligan “played a key role in advising us on how to move forward” \[L\]. Moreover, the Caucus Chair subsequently recommended to the Speaker of the Dáil that the Oireachtas should establish a Women’s Caucus and the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus was established in 2017 \[K\] \[L\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Scottish Government is seeking to increase the number of adult learners of Gaelic. Research led by Professor Michelle Macleod and Dr Marsaili MacLeod has enabled this by informing policy, shaping pedagogy and influencing practice in this area. Macleod and MacLeod identified weaknesses in earlier learning provision, such as the over\-reliance on one teaching method, the lack of learning materials and the absence of a means to measure progress. Their work has underpinned a significant change in how funds for supporting adult learning are distributed and, working with colleague Dr Moray Watson, influenced the creation and implementation of new teaching methods and materials and assessment tools for adult Gaelic learners worldwide. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Gaelic in Scotland is a minoritised language with around 50,000 fluent speakers and a learning population of approximately 3,000 at any one time. Significant investment by the Scottish Government, through the Non\-Departmental Public Body *Bòrd na Gàidhlig*, has attempted to slow the decline in speakers and increase the number of learners. A key element of this strategy has been the *National Gaelic Plan 2012\-17*, priorities of which include: ‘extending access to, and participation in, a wide range of Gaelic learning opportunities for adults’ and ‘ensuring good resources are available to support adults learning Gaelic’. For adult learners, a key aspect of Bòrd na Gàidhlig’s provision was through significant funding of the *Ùlpan* method. 

 In 2015, MacLeod and Macleod were commissioned by Bòrd na Gàidhlig to produce a research report on adult Gaelic acquisition, *Delivery of Gaelic to Adults through Ùlpan*, in order to assess the success, or otherwise, of their policy decision to invest in this mode of Gaelic teaching \[P1\]. Their report \[1\], drew attention to a number of important shortcomings regarding this investment. 

 MacLeod and Macleod demonstrated that adult learners undertaking the *Ùlpan* programme were lacking in motivation, were not progressing through the levels, found the rigidity of the pedagogy to be stifling and needed additional materials for out\-of\-class support.  MacLeod and Macleod’s research showed that learners were not aware of what progress they were making or how to record their progression \[1\]. Adult learners were looking for additional learning opportunities \(more grammar instruction, more opportunities to hear and speak the language\) and for the ability to measure their progress \[1; 2\], and those needs were not being met by the *Ùlpan* programme. 

 Macleod and MacLeod also found that ‘heritage’ learners \(those who have Gaelic in their family background\) taking the course in the Western Isles, where Gaelic is still a community language, were having more success in acquiring fluency compared to those elsewhere.  A follow\-up study \[P2\] concluded that more exposure to the spoken language was enabling ‘heritage’ learners to achieve better results than learners without this aural exposure \[P2\]. 

 In parallel with the *Ùlpan* \[1\] research, Macleod, collaborating with the University of Glasgow, was funded in 2014 by the Scottish Funding Council and Bòrd na Gàidhlig \[P3\] to create a new framework for measuring Gaelic language competencies \[3\].  The aim of the project, Comasan Labhairt ann an Gàidhlig \(CLAG\) / Gaelic Adult Proficiency \(GAP\), was to lay the groundwork for a methodology to map proficiency scales in Gaelic from beginner to advanced level, aligning Gaelic language learning with the gold\-standard Common European Framework of Reference for Languages \(CEFR\) as well as existing assessment frameworks used by the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework. Macleod’s contribution to the project led to the production of linguistic baselines for measuring competency \(from native speaker recordings\) and also assessed and aligned existing frameworks with the new one \[P3\].  Watson, co\-editor of *Edinburgh Companion to the Gaelic Language* \[4\], collaborated with Michelle Macleod and external partners to explore how these new linguistic baselines could be assessed \[P5\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research led by the University of Aberdeen has impacted the policy, structure and delivery of adult learning of Gaelic in Scotland and worldwide by: 

 ● informing key funding decisions regarding learning methodology by Bòrd na Gàidhlig; 

 ● developing frameworks to assess language competencies; 

 ● developing innovative learning materials. 

 **Informing Bòrd na Gàidhlig strategy** 

 MacLeod and Macleod’s *Ùlpan* report \[P3\] has been used by Bòrd na Gàidhlig to re\-design their policy on supporting and developing adult language acquisition.  According to Bòrd na Gàidhlig ‘The research was invaluable in informing our policy decisions regarding adult language acquisition and informing the National Gaelic Language Plan 2018\-23’. Bòrd na Gàidhlig confirms that the report ‘has had a significant, positive impact on Gaelic for adults in Scotland and has been an important part of the development of this sector in recent years’ \[S1\]. Prior to Aberdeen’s research, Bòrd na Gàidhlig allocated most of its funding for adult learning through the *Ùlpan* method: this method, as reported by MacLeod and Macleod, was not well supported by materials outside of the class, leading to reduced engagement by learners, who in turn faced difficulties assessing their own progress.  MacLeod and Macleod’s findings raised Bòrd na Gàidhlig’s awareness of the issues regarding the *Ùlpan* method and helped to inform Bòrd na Gàidhlig’s decisions regarding funding allocation \[S1\]. 

 **Developing frameworks to assess language competencies** 

 Michelle Macleod worked with the University of Glasgow to create the first empirically derived framework for the measurement of Gaelic linguistic competencies.  The Comasan Luchd\-ionnsachaidh na Gàidhlig / CLAG framework \(based on the international standard Common European Framework of Reference for languages\) has been adopted by Learngaelic.net \(the national portal for information about learning Gaelic\) to support learners’ progression. Macleod’s contribution led to the production of linguistic baselines for measuring competency, derived from native speaker recordings, and also aligned the CLAG framework with existing measures \(e.g. the SQA and SCQF\) with the new one. This provided an objective means of describing learner proficiency. The pages went live on the LearnGaelic.net website on 6 January 2020 and, as of December 2020, 4371 people have accessed the site’s self\-assessment tool \[S2\].  Bòrd na Gàidhlig has said, ‘ *The resource will sit within a suite of resources envisaged in the strategy currently being developed by the Bòrd and other national partners*’ \[S3\].  With funding support from Bòrd na Gàidhlig, Watson and Macleod undertook a CEFR\-GLAG test implementation pilot for the first level of the framework with 12 adult learners from across Scotland, which took place on 1 August 2020 \[P5; S4\]. Agreement has been reached with LearnGaelic.net to roll out more tests at different levels in the future. 

 **Developing innovative learning materials** 

 Macleod and MacLeod’s research \[1\] pointed to the need for more innovative learning materials. In 2017 Dr Watson worked with international language company Glossika \(https://ai.glossika.com/\), to develop language courses for a global audience for Scottish Gaelic, Irish, Welsh and Breton Fluency 1\-3 \[P4\]. Glossika is an immersive learning portal, supported by a team of linguists and polyglots based in Taiwan, dedicated to helping learners achieve fluency through a spaced repetition language\-learning method, which is completely audio\-based. Watson worked with Glossika to develop content for both Scottish Gaelic and other Celtic languages. The Scottish Gaelic course, which is freely accessible on the website, is available via the Glossika app and has had 2514 registered learners \(4 December 2020\) \[S5\]. The online newspaper *Isle of Man Today* cited the Manx language development officer for Culture Vannin saying: ‘ *This is a fantastic addition to the already substantial body of on\-line material available for the learner of Manx. It is also great that Glossika are providing the course free to learners as a way of supporting minority languages. This will be of long\-term benefit to the language and culture of the island*’ \[S6\]. According to Glossika, Gaelic was the third most popular free course on Glossika \[S7\]. In addition to the Glossika materials, and in line with one of the recommendations of \[1\] that there was a need for more learning materials, Watson has published three new Gaelic textbooks during the census period adding to his Progressive Gaelic series: 

 Progressive Gaelic 3, Aberdeen: Follais Books, 2017: pp. 220. 

 Progressive Gaelic 4, Aberdeen: Follais Books, 2018: pp. 230. 

 Gaelic Workbook 1, Aberdeen: Follais Books, 2020: pp. 222. 

 His most recent edition, ‘Gaelic Workbook 1: Progressive Gaelic Level 1 Workbook’, published in May 2020 remains \#2 best seller out of 64,000 \[S7\]. A user review from Reddit Gaidhlig \[S8\] highlighted the accessibility of his research material: 

 ‘*I have found the best books so far, for me, have been the Moray Watson Progressive Gaelic books \(on Amazon\). Very strong but operate at a pace that respects the capacity of the learner*’ \[S8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research undertaken by Professor Graham Edgar and co\-researchers has led to the development of a world\-leading approach to the measurement of situation awareness \(SA\).  Good SA underpins effective human performance in almost any context.   The measurement methodology incorporates unique, theoretically robust, measures and is referred to as QASA \(Quantitative Analysis of Situation Awareness\) or \(formerly\) QUASA.  QASA has been applied across multiple domains, and has been adopted by users worldwide, particularly in the domain of firefighting, where QASA has been developed into a training tool referred to as Firemind and, as such, has been incorporated into firefighter training in the UK and Netherlands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Situation awareness is widely regarded as one of the key issues for human factors, and one of the world’s leading researchers in the field \(Mica Endsley\) was, until recently, chief scientific adviser to the US Chief of Staff.  Failures of SA are often identified as a key factor underlying major errors and catastrophic accidents that carry enormous human and financial cost.  Situation awareness is fundamental to good performance and decision\-making in any context. 

 There have been many techniques developed for the measurement of SA, that measure either actual situation awareness \(knowledge of a situation compared to the, ‘ground truth’\) or perceived situation awareness \(how good or bad an individual *believes* their SA to be\).  The QASA approach<sup>6</sup>, originally developed by Edgar within the military domain while employed by BAe Systems, measures both actual and perceived situation awareness, together with another measure that is unique to the QASA tool and provides a measure of information use \(bias\) – a key component of the process of building SA. 

 The underpinning research for QASA spans a wide range, from fundamental neuroscience<sup>3,</sup> through cognitive psychology<sup>6</sup> to applied research<sup>1,2,4,5</sup>. 

 QASA, originally developed in the military domain, has been refined and applied in areas including health, education, driving, and fire and rescue.  A strength of the QASA approach is the strong theoretical underpinning; something that is relatively under\-developed in many SA measures.  The tool is underpinned by research in the new area of ‘neuroergonomics’ funded by a grant won from the Ministry of Defence’s ‘Competition of Ideas.’  This has led to the publication of one of the first ever papers linking SA to the underpinning neuroscience<sup>3</sup>. 

 The QASA approach was tested initially within a military command and control simulation<sup>7</sup>, providing an explanation for the cognitive processes that may underpin, ‘friendly fire’, and was then successfully applied in highly realistic army brigade\-level simulations and international tri\-service disaster relief simulations \(findings unpublished due to security considerations\).  The unique bias measure within QASA gave insights \(that there are individual differences in information use when building SA\) that would not have been obtainable with any other current measure. 

 A finding that information is used selectively when building SA drove the application of the QASA approach in the health domain<sup>5</sup>, where missing key information can lead to poor patient outcome, particularly in the domain investigated \(obstetrics\).  This research was funded by a grant from Great Western Research and United Bristol Healthcare.  A key finding of this research was, again, that individuals use available information in different ways when building SA and also that interruptions are a key factor in lapses in SA. 

 The application of QASA in the domain of firefighting has been supported by two Erasmus\+ grants generating a body of research<sup>1,2,4,G</sup> on individual and cultural differences in situation awareness and an  [online training tool](https://www.labvanced.com/player.html?id=9894) has now been implemented to allow firefighters and trainers to access the tool remotely and to use it to either self\-test or incorporate into formal training sessions.  A paper describing the approach, produced in collaboration with stakeholders across Europe, has been published in premier international professional publications for firefighters<sup>1,4</sup>.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The QASA approach was first developed in the military domain and it is here that it has been adopted by others to look at a range of real\-world issues such as: 

-  Improving SA in single\-ship naval anti\-air warfare and also measuring SA in anti\-submarine warfare helicopter crew \(ASW\) where the approach was well accepted <sup>E</sup>. 

-  The impact of collaborative work support systems in a large\-scale military 

 experiment with Canadian Forces officers <sup>I</sup>. 

-  Performance in a digital warfighting exercise <sup>H</sup>. 

-  Situation awareness within the context of a realistic command\-and\-control scenario <sup>F</sup>. 

 The QASA approach has also been used by other workers in non\-military scenarios such as: 

-  Improving CCTV security surveillance <sup>J</sup>. 

-  Developing effective human\-robot interaction in teleoperated systems <sup>B</sup>. 

 The QASA approach has been widely adopted by other researchers and, to quote a paper in the area <sup>F</sup>, 

 ‘*QUASA, as developed by Edgar et al. \(2000, see also Edgar et al. 2003\) is, currently, one of the most frequently used method of collecting and analysing data on SA.*’ 

 The QASA approach has now been developed into a tool designed for use in firefighter training.  The development of this tool was supported by an EU grant under the EU Erasmus\+ scheme and the tool is referred to as, ‘ [Firemind](https://uniofglos.blog/firemind/).’  Firemind research has been accepted for publication in professional fire and rescue publications<sup>1,4</sup>.  Papers have been published in International Fire Professional \(IFP\), the Journal of the Institution of Fire Engineers \- a global organisation for fire professionals established in 1918 and also in ‘Fire’ magazine \(established in 1908\), the leading magazine for firefighters, distributed to fire services nationally and internationally. 

 The Firemind approach was presented at the Annual Conference on Fire\-related Research and Development, UK, where it was awarded the Research Excellence Award \(best paper\) sponsored jointly by Gore Associates \(a large, multinational company\) and Fire magazine<sup>G</sup>.  A publication<sup>2</sup> in the International Journal Emergency Services was an Outstanding Paper Award Winner. 

 Firemind, was developed initially with the UK Fire and Rescue service.<sup>2,G</sup>.  The introduction of the world\-leading methodology into the training of incident commanders generated transformational changes for the end\-users.  UK incident commanders that took part in the training reported changes in their day\-to\-day practice of incident command<sup>G</sup>. Firemind has now been further developed across six other countries \(Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, The Netherlands, Spain and Poland\).  The Firemind tool has revealed differences in information processing across the firefighters in the different countries<sup>1</sup>.  As a result of the Firemind research two members of the unit \(Edgar and Baker\) were invited to attend an EU\-funded Exchange of Experts on the topic of mental strength, and to present a paper to a symposium on SA, hosted by the Institute for Safety \(IFV\) that is responsible for developing and implementing the training of firefighters in the Netherlands. 

 Firemind has been used by IFV Netherlands in a longitudinal study of firefighter SA<sup>A</sup> and has been incorporated into the training of Firefighters in the Netherlands <sup>C,D</sup>. 

 Members of the UoA \(Edgar & Baker\) have again successfully bid into the EU Erasmus\+ scheme to fund a development of the Firemind tool \(Firefront\) that expands the tool to measure situation *understanding*, as well as situation *awareness*.  Firefront involves two of the original Firemind partners \(Belgium and the Netherlands\) together with 4 new partners \(two new partners from Denmark, Estonia and Spain\).  All of the EU partners are actively involved in the training of firefighters. 

 The Firefront training scenario has now been migrated to an  [online platform](https://www.labvanced.com/player.html?id=9894) and is available as a self\-contained package that can be used by firefighters and trainers worldwide, either to self\-test \(the package gives detailed and individualised feedback on performance\) or to incorporate into formal training.
