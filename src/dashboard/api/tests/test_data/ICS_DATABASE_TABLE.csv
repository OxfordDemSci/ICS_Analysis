 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of South Wales \(USW\) research underpinned the UK Government innovation and skills policy by delivering the 2030 Future of Work report for the UK Commission for Employment and Skills \(UKCES\) to predict how changes in the economic, technological and employment landscape were going to impact future workforce informing national and regional economic policy development. Working with economic development stakeholders in Wales, USW research informed Welsh economic policy development and implementation in the public, private and voluntary sectors, leading to policy change in the Wales Council for Voluntary Action and the significant investment by the Welsh Government in the Heads of the Valleys area economic regeneration.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The UK Commission for Employment and Skills \( [UKCES](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-commission-for-employment-and-skills/about)\) was a publicly funded, industry\-led organisation offering UK employers guidance on skills and employment issues in the UK. In 2013, the rapidly changing economic, technological and employment landscape led the organisation to advertise a tender to understand the potential impacts of these changes upon future workforce skills requirements. 

 **UKCES commissions USW\-led research** 

 In 2013, Professor Martin **Rhisiart,** Director of the Centre for Research in Futures and Innovation \(CRFI\) at USW and a recognised academic in the field of futures research **\[R2\]** successfully bid to UKCES to carry out the research entitled ‘The Future of Work: Jobs and Skills in 2030’ **\[R1, F1\]** to analyse trends shaping the future of UK analyse trends and potential disruptions for the labour market in the UK. **Rhisiart** worked with private consultancy firm Z\-punkt to interview senior business leaders from the UK and internationally and develop 2030 scenarios for skills and employment in the UK. The study identified options and implications for key stakeholders in the skills and employment agenda: employers, education and training providers, individuals and policymakers. The 2030 scenarios focused on seven of the key economic sectors for the UK and assessed possible impacts on representative occupations. The 2030 qualitative Foresight project complements the other research conducted by UKCES on quantitative skills projections. As result, two main project outputs were launched by UKCES – a Key Findings Report \(20 pages\) and a full report \(evidence report\). 

 Key themes emerging from the research include the need for a focus on technology and innovation, a focus on interconnectivity and collaboration \(including between organisations, education providers and policy makers\), an increase in individual responsibility \(both from employees as well as those developing their own business\), and the impact on sectors particularly public services due to limited resources. **Rhisiart**’s research identified the key factors driving change and the four future work scenarios. He specifically identified the growing importance and potential contribution of Social Enterprises \(SE\) to the labour market as a key future trend. The outputs of the work are published by the UK Government and underpinned further research commission by UKCES   [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jobs\-and\-skills\-in\-2030](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jobs-and-skills-in-2030) .  **Rhisiart** and his partners Z\_punkt went on to evaluate how the findings of the Future of Work report were being used by UKCES and its member organisations, education providers and policy makers to encourage debate and inform future policy and strategic investment decisions. The research identified the importance of engaging stakeholders \(over 200 had been engaged\) into foresight activities to co\-create its products and to build in pathways to implementation. Also the importance of social media and scenario visualisations were importance factors in successful take up **\[R4, R5\].** 

 Following the death of **Rhisiart** in 2017 the Business School continued to address opportunities for regional economic development using the scenario planning and stakeholder engagement techniques. USW Business School continued to work with the Welsh Government **\[F2\]** to develop a regional economic development strategy aimed at maximising the potential impact of the enhancing a trunk road in the “Heads of the Valleys” region. The project brought together existing research and evidence to develop a clear action plan to support the Valleys Taskforce. The research drew out three priority actions and recommendations for next steps, providing a framework for the future evaluation of the infrastructure development programme across the Heads of the Valleys. 

 **USW research highlights key role of Social Enterprise \(SE\) in South Wales** 

 Although the research into SE and their future importance is deemed a lower impact in the UKCES report, they are seen as a way of regenerating and developing new jobs, skills, and regeneration opportunities. Historically, SE’s have been seen to be set up to serve the most deprived areas, with nearly a third of SEs in the UK operating in the most socially deprived regions. Wales is the lowest performing economy in the UK. As such, the South Wales valleys has seen a steady and significant decline over the past 30 years as heavy industry \(coal and steel\) moved away from the area. 

 In 2016 **Rhisiart** and his research partners were commissioned by the  [Wales Council for Voluntary Action \(WCVA\)](https://wcva.cymru/about/) and the 19 Voluntary Councils in Wales to apply futures research theories to develop a new common strategic framework between the WCVA and CVCs in Wales. This was needed to address the new legislation in the Welsh Government’s Wellbeing of Future Generations Act of 2015. WCVA provides services and support to charities, community groups, voluntary organisations, social enterprises, and volunteers and consists of over 2,500 third sector organisations. **Rhisiart** applied some of the concepts developed in R1 to identify future trends relevant to third sector organisations in Wales and develop challenging and responsive scenarios for the sector to be integrated into the programme of strategic review **\[R6\].** Findings included the future importance of the third sector as an advocate of community concerns in environmental policy development; the role of the sector in innovative approaches to finance and access to capital in Wales; potential implications of third sector organisations having to compete with private sector businesses. 

 Furthermore, research carried out by **White** and others **\[R3\]** investigated the barriers to adoption and success of social enterprises in the region, bringing together social entrepreneurs, policy makers and academics to build on the UKCES report recommendations. The research found that many tensions faced by SEs are common regardless of geography and socio\-economic circumstances and derive from pressures on SEs to balance commercial and social success. The research also identified that issues such as social value need to be developed. In addition, the research identified four new factors not previously recognised in the literature shown to impinge upon the successful operation of SEs: ‘Leadership’, the ‘Professionalisation of Marketing’, Perception of Social Enterprise Validity’ and ‘Situatedness’.

 **USW Research Impacts on UK and Regional Government Economic development policy.** 

 The UKCES 2030 Future of Work report was published in 2014 and the next year **Rhisiart** returned to UKCES to evaluate how the results had been used by UKCES **\[R5\]** and the impact. He found that UKCES had disseminated the findings through a social media campaign, stakeholder workshops and national media/press channels leading to considerable take up by employers and the public sector across the regions of the UK and across industry sectors. Some of these developments provided further applied research opportunities leading to further impact. Examples of the impacts that arose are described here. 

 In April 2016, as a result of this research and his expertise in foresight scenario planning, **Rhisiart** was invited to participate in an expert workshop and one\-to\-one discussions led by the Public Policy Institute for Wales \(PPIW\) to consider how to improve the economic performance of Wales and identify future opportunities for innovation and economic development to present to the Welsh Government. This led to a report “Improving the Economic Performance of Wales: Existing Evidence and Evidence Needs” **\[S3\]** to which **Rhisiart** made a key contribution. The report summarises the evidence and future evidence needs for what works in improving the performance of an economy in Wales. As a result, in July that year, the Welsh Government \(WG\) established the  [Ministerial Taskforce for the South Wales Valley](https://www.sewales-ret.co.uk/valleys-taskforce/) , comprising the Cabinet Secretary for Economy and the Minister for Skills, together with a group of expert advisors and chaired by the Deputy Minister for Economy and Transport. Over the next two years the Taskforce undertook extensive consultation and engagement with people living and working in the South Wales valleys and other stakeholders. 

 Very sadly, Martin **Rhisiart** passed away in this period, but the Welsh Government continued to work with his USW Business School colleagues and commissioned a study **\[F2\]** to investigate the economic benefits of improving the A465, the so called “Heads of the Valleys” road. 

 The USW team led by **Page**, then Head of the Business school and supported by researchers **Yeung Min** and **Netana** applied the future scenario planning concepts and stakeholder engagement to understand how the community and other stakeholders in the Heads of the Valleys area perceived the planned infrastructure investments. Concerns were raised about whether the benefits of the taskforce’s proposals would be felt as equally by communities at the Heads of the Valleys as those closer to Cardiff, Swansea, and Newport. The USW team facilitated a workshop to explore how the benefits of the A465 investment could be maximised for the Heads of the Valleys communities from which a set of priorities and proposals for investment were developed **\[S1 p22\].** USW analysed existing evidence and engaged with relevant stakeholders to identify the priorities. The main priority was the development of the A465 Innovation Chain: a multi\-purpose innovation cluster based on an inter\-regional smart specialisation strategy. The South Wales Valley Taskforce went on to designate seven Strategic Hub areas including 2 in the Heads of the Valleys area: Ebbw Vale; Merthyr Tydfil **\[S4\].** 

  

 In 2019, as noted in the Valleys Taskforce update report in 2019 **\[S4 p.10\]** “Following on from the work undertaken by USW last year **\[R6\]** the Valleys taskforce has brought together a group of key stakeholders from across the Valleys who are currently assessing how this work could be progressed further.” The subsequent development of a Strategic Hub in Ebbw Vale has been started and is called the “National Digital Exploitation Centre \( [NDEC](https://www.ndec.org.uk/)\) **\[S4: p. 23 and S5\]**. This involved global technology company Thales and USW’s Cyber Security academic team to establish a £20m cyber centre to sit at the heart of its Tech Valleys programme. 

 *“The NDEC and its innovative digital activities have a demonstrable influence and impact on Wales at a local, regional and national level, positively impacting all areas of the community from mature businesses and SME start\-ups, to individuals and schools.”*  [https://www.ndec.org.uk/](https://www.ndec.org.uk/) 

 The Centre is the first research and development facility of its kind in Wales and will provide the setting for SMEs and microbusinesses to test and develop their digital concepts. The Centre will be delivered by Thales in collaboration with USW. Both the Welsh Government and Thales have committed £10m each to the project which is expected to generate significant income. Other impacts from the Taskforce to September 2019 that resulted from the USW research **\[R6\]** include £1.5m being allocated to valleys based Foundational Economy projects and a further £8m invested in tourism initiatives throughout the regions **\[S4\].** 

 **UKCES report by USW researchers had national, international and sectoral influence:** 

 The 2030 Future of Work study **\[R1\]** generated impacts across a wide range of areas. The study is the most downloaded of all UKCES reports **\[R4 Section 5.1 p208\]**, indicating the wider appeal and dissemination of the study. The findings of the research were drawn on by UKCES to conduct further research and analysis into specific industries and subject areas. For example, a review of STEM skills to advise and inform future development of this kind of provision **\[S8\],** Careers of the Future report and guide **\[S6\],** and an assessment of UK skills which set out long\-term priorities and principles for growth **\[S7\]** co\-developed with the Confederation of British Industry \(CBI\) and Trade Union Congress \(TUC\). The work carried out by USW led to follow up research by the Construction Industry Training Board \(CITB\) into sector specific skills futures and influenced policy within the Sector Skills Councils **\[S9\].** The study was used by the cross\-Government group on the Future of Work, with the specific focus on development and design of Government Work and services including the Department for Work and Pensions, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and the Cabinet Office. The report was also presented to over 80 nations delegates at the British Council event ‘Bringing the Learning Home’ in Jordan, November 2016 **\[S10\],** comprising skills experts and practitioners, providing a platform to forge new relationships, enhance existing projects and accelerate international collaboration. 

 **USW’s research informed policy on supporting third sector development in Wales:** 

 **Rhisiart** also applied his scenario planning techniques to help the Welsh voluntary sector develop a strategic toolkit to help plan for the future. Research **\[R6\]** led to the development of 

 planning tools designed to help voluntary organisations in Wales to plan in the context of change, much of which we cannot predict. The WCVA published report **\[R6\]** set out a way for the sector to predict how society in Wales could change and explore the potential implications for the third sector in Wales. The Shape Your Future report was commissioned by WCVA and the CVCs to contribute to their strategic planning and provides a useful resource for the wider third sector and partners in Wales. USW research \[R3\] fed into stakeholder engagement events hosted in 2016 by USW to raise awareness, stimulate discussion and debate, and further delegates’ understanding of operational challenges. The events were attended by key stakeholders including social enterprises and entrepreneurs, academia, and local government \[S2: p.32\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Each year over $15bn of pharmaceuticals are sold which unintentionally cause or exacerbate heart disease. Since 2002 Coventry University researchers have developed a novel predictive Work\-Loop assay, and complementary computational methods, to improve the early detection of adverse drug issues on heart contraction. 

 One result of this research was the successful spin\-out company InoCardia Ltd., founded in 2013 to provide innovative services in cardiovascular safety assessment, creating revenue and jobs from its Coventry headquarters. Research has driven health sector innovation and productivity gains for \[text removed for publication\] and benefitted patient outcomes. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 One of the major reasons for safety\-related attrition \(drug failure\) is adverse effects drugs can have on the cardiovascular system, including effects on the force of contraction of the heart \(inotropy\). Current cardiovascular tests used within the pharmaceutical industry cannot reliably predict drug effects on human hearts, and this often results in postponements or withdrawal to the development of safe and effective products. 

 Responding to this, CU’s Professor Helen Maddock and Professor Rob James investigated the use of an in\-vitro test, using heart tissue in the lab to closely mimic the physiology of the contraction and relaxation of the heart. This aimed to improve the safety assessment of drugs in development within the pharmaceutical industry, and reduce drug\-induced cardiotoxicity \[R1\-3\] \[G1\-8\]. 

 From 2000, initial research by Maddock using a functional working heart model \[R4\] \[G1\], and by James using skeletal muscle \[R5\] \[G2\], led to collaborative work where they developed a heart tissue in\-vitro test referred to as the work\-loop assay. This was capable of more closely simulating cardiac contractile physiology, mimicking the forces that are required to occur when the heart fills with blood in order for it to be pumped around the body, and enabled researchers to successfully predict both the negative and positive side effects medical drugs would have on the heart, before the clinical testing stage \[G3\] \[R1\-3; R6\]. 

 Using papillary muscle, the work\-loop assay was considered to be important to the pharmaceutical industry and in 2013 InoCardia Ltd. was founded to providing a cardiac drug safety assessment service for pharmaceutical companies, using an investment of £529,000 over four years from the Mercia Fund. From 2013\-20 Maddock led on the development and expansion of their research portfolio and in collaboration with James, with InoCardia and CU respectively building InoCardia’s cardiac safety assessment portfolio, supported by over £2.5m funding \[G3\-8\] from InnovateUK, NC3R, European Development Research Fund and Horizon 2020. 

 From development of the initial academic research \[R1; R3\], InoCardia has optimised and industrialised the in vitro work *\-*loop: the world's first non\-clinical contractility assay which offers superior predictivity and is currently revolutionising the field of cardiac safety assessment \[R1\-3 **;** R6\]. The resultant ‘Work\-Loop Platform’ is superior to competitor technologies in that it is better able to predict the risk that a new medicine may affect heart contractility in humans. The platform is validated for use by safety pharmacologists prior to experimental medicine entering clinic, to manage embedded inotropy risk. 

 Following funding from an EIT\-Digital\-Horizon 2020 award \[G7\] InoCardia launched an online virtual screen named ‘The Contractome\-AI’. Rather than physical testing in the lab, this  provides users with the ability to perform risk\-assessments on drugs using computer modelling, helping assess their safety far before they reach clinical trial stages \[R6\] \[G7\-8\]. Research underpinning InoCardia’s work received a recent ‘Technological Innovation Award’ from the global Safety Pharmacology Society in 2020, and in December 2020 Maddock was awarded a Women in Innovation award, recognising InoCardia’s contribution to solving a pressing societal, environmental and economic challenges in the UK \[G8\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 As a consequence of CU’s research, the commercially successful spin\-out company InoCardia Ltd. has changed the face of drug development by offering new capabilities and knowledge within safety testing in pharmaceutical production, to improve patient health outcomes. 

 <ins>Spin\-Out \- InoCardia</ins> 

 In December 2013, InoCardia Ltd. was spun out from CU as a company specialising in the provision of predictive cardiac contractility assessment for early drug discovery. InoCardia is a successful self\-funding business and has leveraged \[text removed for publication\] investor and public UK/EU funding from bodies including InnovateUK, NC3Rs, and EIT Digital \[S1, G5\-8\], to develop the innovative Work\-Loop Platform \[S1\]. Since its foundation the company has created seven full\-time staff positions at its Coventry Headquarters and employs an additional three PhD students. InoCardia has worked with global pharmaceutical companies \[text removed for publication\] \[S1\] to screen new drugs in development, develop bespoke testing assays, and identify cardiovascular toxicity in exemplars from compound libraries \[S1\]. The novel assay has been used in the assessment of \[text removed for publication\], providing a predictive test approach to preclinical safety and efficacy assessment \[S1\]. 

 <ins>Informing Drugs’ Development</ins> 

 Both the *in\-vitro* work\-loop heart cell test and the Contractome\-AI have established InoCardia as a world leader in cardiac contractility safety assessment, through better prediction of drug activity prior to clinical trials. InoCardia brings an ‘entirely new approach to characterise drug effects on the full contractile/relaxation cycle in vitro’ \[S2; S3\]. As the Senior Director of UCB Biopharma states, the Work\-Loop Platform has ‘greater predictivity to humans than existing tests’ \[S4; S5\]. Safety Pharmacology Society \(SPS\) acknowledges InoCardia has enabled companies ‘to better characterise drug treatment effects’, taking into account ‘the full contraction/relaxation phase of the contractile response’ \[S6\]. The former Pfizer head of Global Safety Pharmacology attests that the assays ‘add fundamental scientific knowledge and relevant improvements’ in the relatively unexplored ‘area of cardiovascular safety pharmacology’ \[S2\]. 

 <ins>Improving Drugs Testing and Production</ins> 

 InoCardia’s radical approach is a major step forward in the production of safe, effective medicines. The effectiveness of the Work\-Loop Platform has changed ‘confidence in the predictivity of the *in vitro* assays’ rather than *in vivo* animal testing, allowing project teams to make ‘a better allocation of resources to compounds that have a greater chance of success’ \[S2\]. The Work\-Loop assay ‘only requires milligram quantities of material’ and therefore, ‘can be used much earlier in the drug discovery process’ \[S2\]. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies have reduced money they would have spent on the development of drugs doomed to fail at clinical trial; the ‘ability to detect cardiac contractility issues earlier allows money \(many millions of pounds\) to be spent on compounds with a higher chance of success’ \[S4\]. 

 The most recent innovation from InoCardia, the *in\-silico* Contractome\-AI, has given pharmaceutical companies a pioneering new capacity to model compounds for cardiac contractility virtually, based on known qualities of components. Developed in collaboration with a computational chemistry\-modelling company Cresset, used by eight of the top ten pharmaceutical companies, this has allowed an ‘even earlier assessment of compounds’ potential effects on cardiac contractility’\[S7; S8\]. As the Senior Director of UCB states, ‘pharmaceutical companies of all sizes’ can now make these savings, ‘with no reduction in confidence in the compound safety’ \[S4\]. Informed by InoCardia, the collaboration also drove ‘scientific development of Cresset’, which ‘encouraged the company scientists to take a more holistic view of biological issues \[S7; S8\]. 

 InoCardia’s processes, underpinned by CU research, have driven gains in productivity, enhanced processes, and reduced waste. The company have also used their human tissue assay in safety assessments to advocate for technology that reduces and replaces animal use in research: in May 2017 Maddock organised a Safety Pharmacology Society meeting with NC3RS, which provided ‘valuable information’ on how use of ‘human tissue in safety assessment has evolved’, to inform and optimise practice \[S6; S9, p.29\]. InoCardia’s innovative services have helped position the UK as a leader in new drugs development technologies  which reduce animal tissue use, which according to the former Pfizer Head of Global Safety Pharmacology, marks a ‘…new era of drug discovery’ \[S2\]. 

 <ins>Improving Patient Health Outcomes</ins> 

 Further to improving patient health outcomes through improved drugs development, Maddock has also collaborated with University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire \(UHCW\) to support improvements in the detection of cardiac injury in cancer patients. The research which underpins InoCardia’s work has also given ‘important clinical insight and knowledge in relation to therapy induced cardiac toxicity’ in a clinical setting \[S10\].  It has ‘provided fundamental scientific knowledge, research culture and support’ to practitioners at UHCW, resulting in institutional change represented by the creation of a ‘new and important collaborative multi\-disciplinary Cardio\-Oncology team between Oncology and Cardiology colleagues’ \[S10\]. This has driven ‘beneficial changes’ in the clinicians’ abilities ’to undertake research and improve clinical patient outcomes’, as there was previously little formal collaboration between cancer treatment teams and cardiac health specialists, despite the negative responses the heart can have to radiotherapy \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Kirklees local authority was listed in the highest 10% of deprived districts in the 2019 Indices of Multiple Deprivation. Like much of the UK, Kirklees is experiencing shop closures on the high street, exacerbated by the credit crunch in 2007, austerity policies and a move to online retail. Using Huddersfield town as a case study for modelling and reflecting on cultural re\-development, the School of Art, Design and Architecture \(ADA\) at the University of Huddersfield has engaged in action research to support the conditions for creative and cultural activity and contribute to the vibrancy of the town centre. 

 Researchers at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\) worked closely with the Creative and Cultural Development team at Kirklees Council to populate approximately 40 former retail units with a two\-year programme of events and activities, that continues to iterate into 2021. Impact arising from the research has included benefits to artists, creative organisations and audiences based in Huddersfield, through a more visible, vibrant and collaborative cultural offering. Further impact was achieved through changing the way that Kirklees Council envisioned creative and cultural activity, embedding collaborative working into the ‘Huddersfield Blueprint’ regeneration plan and post\-Covid\-19 road maps to cultural recovery. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Huddersfield is situated in the North of England with a population of around 160,000. The town, and the wider Kirklees region, have many positive attributes, however, in the 2019 Indices of Multiple Deprivation published by the government, Kirklees was listed in the highest 10% of deprived districts and scored extremely low for living environment, crime, education, skills and training. The town has been experiencing, like much of the UK, a change in the ways consumers use the high street. Within the centre of Huddersfield many units in the Queensgate Indoor market and surrounding high street stood empty. Sociologists have argued that shop closures may lead to a breakdown in the social contract \(Yuill, C., 2017; Hubbard, P., 2019\). However, cultural production has been identified by Kirklees Council as one of the ways to sustain economic benefits and prosperity in Huddersfield. This research addresses the problem of shop closures as part of a proposed model of cultural redevelopment. 

 During 2014\-2016, **Professor Steve Swindells** \(tenure at Huddersfield 1999\-2017\) and **Dr Anna Powell** partnered with Kirklees Council and Huddersfield Art Gallery in a programme of research titled ROTOЯ III & IV. The ROTOЯ projects were collaborative exhibition programmes, testing public engagement strategies and partnership working models, based at Huddersfield Art Gallery and funded by Arts Council England. The insights that ROTOЯ III & IV generated included: the efficacy of its partnership model \(based around a council and HEI and incorporating other creative and cultural producers\), the importance of stakeholder consultation, and the value of establishing localised networks of creative and cultural practitioners to respond to wider social problems with site specificity. These insights were effectively disseminated in a range of publications **\(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\)**. In February 2018, Professor Swindells and Dr Powell brought together the network they had established through ROTOЯ for the *Culture, Community, Creativity* conference. This was an opportunity to reflect on what had emerged during ROTOЯ, identify the concerns of the network and develop strategies to implement live action research in the town. At the conference, the most important question that the network settled on for future collaborative working, using Huddersfield as a case study, was: *How might creative thinking and action be nurtured and lead to the growth of places?* This question, along with the insights from the ROTOЯ research, led directly to the creation of a new programme launched in 2018 by **Dr Rowan Bailey, Professor Nic Clear** and **Professor Donal Fitzpatrick** titled *Temporary Contemporary*. 

 Using the method of live action research, *Temporary Contemporary* tested its contention that embedding creative and cultural activity into the town and making this activity visible through a shared ecology would bring benefits for the participants, including but not limited to: **artists, cultural organisations, arts development professionals, audiences** and **students**. It initiated this testing through a collaborative programme that occupied shop and indoor market retail units, encouraged the formation of a network of cultural activities and producers, and then reflected on the benefits of the programme as it unfolded. The aim of the programme, in direct partnership with the Creative and Cultural Development Team at Kirklees Council, was to strengthen the conditions for creative and cultural production in Huddersfield by extending the partnership network initiated by ROTOЯ. The programme, combining research exhibitions, art, craft, music ‘greening’, sport, public meeting spaces, food, drink and opportunities for young people, entrepreneurs, artisans and retailers, interrogated the nature of **place\-based making** and the values of generating a **‘mixed ecology’**. The exhibitions themselves included reflections on Huddersfield **\(3.4\)**, place\-based making, commoning practices and future visions/ways of seeing the town. 

 The findings of the research \(disseminated in a book **3.5** and journal article **3.6**\) have helped to augment the population of vacant retail units in Huddersfield \(within Queensgate Market and the Piazza shopping centre\) with ‘happenings’ \(exhibition events\) and by fostering a network/critical mass of partners – including local authorities and HEIs – has improved the conditions for cultural creation in the town. Moreover, the research has found that the values arising from the initiative have not been exclusively economic, but rather social, aesthetic, educational and ‘ecological’, meaning that different cultural practices and people are more effectively and meaningfully linked. This model of collaborative working and its findings has influenced other space providers in Huddersfield through the network and has led to a set of guidelines, shared branding and advertising through Creative Kirklees and Hello Huddersfield \(the platform run by Huddersfield Business Improvement District \(Hudd BID\)\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Benefits to the locally\-based cultural organisations, workers and audiences \(activities, opportunities\)** 

 As part of this live action research project, the *Temporary Contemporary* initiative strengthened the conditions for cultural production in the town and demonstrated a strategy that increased the vibrancy of the high street, to the benefit of cultural organisations, cultural workers and audiences. The project began in 2018, in Queensgate Market, an important modernist landmark and retail destination in Huddersfield, when around 30\-40 of the Market’s approx. 100 stalls were vacant. In 2019, the Piazza shopping centre, an area of high footfall in the town centre, had over 13 empty units. The vacant spaces in the market and the shopping centre were occupied during the research project by arts and cultural organisations including: West Yorkshire Print Workshop, Children’s Art School and Lawrence Batley Theatre at low or no cost \(the rents, rates and utilities value of the spaces are around £700pcm\) on a rolling, temporary basis that suited their project\-based work.  Crucially, the temporary nature of the occupation of the units was underpinned by a longer\-term membership of the network, with joined up marketing and strategy meetings and a sense of shared identity, the further impacts of which are outlined below. 

 Prior to *Temporary Contemporary*, cultural sector workers based in Huddersfield and the surrounding region did not have regular opportunities to convene and plan future partnerships. The importance of *Temporary Contemporary* in strengthening the conditions for the creative sector is underscored by the Director for Northern Economy and Partnerships, Arts Council England, who writes: “Cultural practitioners that operate in Huddersfield are based over a wide geography – including Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield. It is important to have opportunities like the *Temporary Contemporary* happenings to meet and network in Huddersfield. It is critically important and shouldn’t be under\-estimated” **\(5.1\).** This is reiterated by the Curator of Yorkshire Sculpture Park: “\[ *Temporary Contemporary\]* has created conditions for supporting arts and culture in Huddersfield, by embedding arts and culture within a wider ecology and cultivating a network of practitioners and organisations. This is a huge benefit to artists and organisations based outside of large cultural centres who may not otherwise have seen themselves as part of a critical mass” **\(5.2\)**. 

 Specific cultural sector workers who have benefited from *Temporary Contemporary* include Victoria McCorkell, an independent arts development professional, who set up the ‘Parlour’ space in Queensgate market to provide artists with professional development training opportunities. McCorkell explains that Parlour has benefitted from sitting within *Temporary Contemporary* where it provides artist development support: “\[being situated in an\] open space in the heart of a community with links to *Temporary Contemporary* and an artistic and creative community led to new networks and relationships being formed in a short space of time \[… *Temporary Contemporary has*\] had a direct impact on our success to date” **\(5.3\)**. Local artisan beverage businesses Magic Rock and Kwas have benefitted from promoting and selling their products at *Temporary Contemporary* events. Duncan Sime from Kwas confirmed that it had enabled them to reach new audiences and connect to other creatives: “The happenings have given us a platform and connected us with new audiences, it has been a networking opportunity – helping us spread the love\!” **\(5.4\)**. 

 The second phase of the project in the Piazza involved delivering joint programming and benefitted  from the crossing\-over of the arts organisations’ different audiences. The Director of WOVEN in Textiles organisation in Kirklees, which temporarily occupied a Piazza shopping centre unit, describes the impact of the programme in creating a community of cultural producers in Huddersfield: “The \[second phase of *Temporary Contemporary*\] is offering a unique opportunity to bring \[diverse\] organisations together as a collective voice. The partners may not naturally have come together, however, within the opportunity afforded to them they see the power in working together” **\(5.5\)**. 

 In July 2020, between the April and November Covid\-19 lockdowns in the UK, the project partners organised the event *Temporary Contemporary: What’s Next?* using the Zoom platform, to reflect on the first two years of programming and plan for the future, given what was already known about the likely effects of Covid\-19 on Huddersfield. Following the event, around 15 beneficiaries \(locally\-based cultural organisations, workers and audiences who had participated in *Temporary Contemporary*\) took the opportunity out of around 200 attendees to feed back to the partners about the first two years of programming and the vision for the future of the initiative in the context of Covid\-19. Their feedback included that the initiative promoted: “Social collaboration and cohesion” and was “innovative and exciting”. Another said that the values they associated with the initiative were that it: “\[filled\] a gap in arts and visual culture that takes place outside the traditional arts venue \[and had\] power to support regeneration and cultural development” **\(5.6\)**. The event confirmed the impacts of the initiative to date and helped to shape funding proposals for the onward development of the initiative, in the context of Covid\-19 cultural recovery. 

 **Changes to culture, society and environment in Huddersfield** 

 During the period 2018\-2020, *Temporary Contemporary* has increased the vibrancy of the market with: over 20 research exhibitions \(some of which have toured internationally to China and New Zealand\), music and artisan pop ups, exhibitions by emerging and mid\-career artists and practitioners, undergraduate and postgraduate research showcases from the School of Art, Design and Architecture, providing opportunities for students to curate in the public realm, and a host of ‘happenings’ to create networking possibilities for cultural producers. These new activities both support the cultural life of the town and offer a solution to the changes happening on the high street. Audiences reported enjoying “the atmosphere, the space, the curation, the market as an example of classic modernist architecture” and remarked that the initiative added “character to what had become a dated market” **\(5.7\)**. 

 Kirklees Council comprised the other main stakeholder and beneficiary group. Insights from the *Temporary Contemporary* programme fed directly into the Huddersfield Blueprint regeneration plan **\(5.8\),** as confirmed by the Creative Economy Manager of Kirklees Council and the Chief Executive of Kirklees Council **\(5.9, 5.10\)**. The Blueprint is a 10\-year vision, launched in 2019 to ‘create a thriving, modern town centre.’ The Creative Economy Manager of Kirklees Council writes: “Eighteen months into the \[ *Temporary Contemporary*\] programme and we have been extremely pleased with the results. The partnership has created a sustained, flexible, sensitive and cultural offer that supports place\-based making. The perception of the indoor market has shifted from being seen as a building in a managed decline to now a building with potential – it has been identified as a site for cultural activity in the future of the town through its new master plan, The Huddersfield Blueprint”. \[…\] Further to this, the insights and reflections of Art, Design and Architecture have provided a greater understanding of how creative spaces can contribute to wider place\-based making” **\(5.9\)**. 

 The Chief Executive of Kirklees writes, “For Kirklees Council, the most important insight generated through the *Temporary Contemporary* research initiative is the importance, not just of arts and culture in place\-based\-making, but in the close co\-existence and negotiation of the arts with food, drink, sport, green spaces, retail and people – all of which, we believe, make a town centre thriving and attractive. \[… *Temporary Contemporary*\] benefits the community of artists and makers involved in the initiative, as well as the wider community” **\(5.10\)**. 

 The Markets Manager corroborated other testimonials: “A huge benefit to the market, arising from the initiative, is that people can get involved and feel greater ownership of the market – a space that belongs to everyone. \[…\] The occupation of the vacant market stalls has increased the vibrancy of the market. \[…\] It has encouraged people to set up small businesses or events here – they can recognise that there is strength and value in setting up something new within an established community of traders and catering outlets. *Temporary Contemporary* has generated a change in people’s mindset about more established market contexts and what they can offer against a backdrop of changes on the British high street” **\(5.11\)**. 

 *Temporary Contemporary* is now a core feature of Kirklees Council arts and culture planning. For example, it is embedded within a range of consortia, including the High Street Heritage Action Zone, to help strengthen the cultural offer of the high street, WOVEN in Kirklees and is now operating in collaboration with other space providers in Huddersfield to offer vacant/meanwhile spaces for a range of creative and cultural activities. The *Temporary Contemporary* partnership secured Innovation of the Year in the National Association of British Market Authorities awards in 2018 **\(5.12\)**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Wireless communications technologies depend on international agreement for the allocation of radio frequency spectrum. High Altitude Platform Stations \(HAPS\) are an emerging technology with potentials of extending mobile broadband coverage; greater international consensus on more HAPS spectrum is critical for HAPS operational, technical, and business viability, especially for rural coverage on a global scale. Through insights from its research on solar\-powered HAPS for communications area coverage, the LHU team have: 

1.  improved awareness of the significance and potential of HAPS among policymakers, journalists and the general public, and 

1.  influenced the position of government representatives, policymakers and regulators to favourably support the allocation of additional HAPS spectrum during the 2019 World Radio Conference \(WRC\-2019\), using the platform of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation \(CTO\), with a membership of 53 countries. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 According to the International Telecommunications Union \(ITU\), approximately 3,700,000,000 people are currently offline, with a significant concentration of this population in least developed countries where rural dwellers are severely impacted. The need to address communications infrastructure issues in rural and unserved parts of the world has created the urgency to look at options like HAPS as likely candidate for this mission. One main reason for this challenge is the economic cost, terrain and logistics of deploying satellite or terrestrial infrastructure. It is therefore important to develop cost\-effective and technically viable options like HAPS to bridge the coverage gap. 

 HAPS is defined by the International Telecommunications Union \(ITU\) as “a station located on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50km and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to the earth”. At this stratospheric altitude, wind profile is described as mild and suitable for hosting platforms with minimal station\-keeping requirements. HAPS can be used to provide persistent communications coverage to mobile and fixed users \(see **Figure 1**\), leveraging its unique technical strengths, which combine those of terrestrial and satellite communication systems **\[R1\]**, **\[R2\]**. The capacity to offer large footprints with signal latency similar to terrestrial systems further places it as a dominant aerial infrastructure. As an aerial platform, it can be easily recovered and redeployed to meet various operational scenarios, an additional capability that neither satellite nor terrestrial systems can offer effectively **\[R2\]**. 



 The HAPS team at LHU is a multi\-disciplinary team of researchers looking at various aspects of the problem. For instance, Dr. Charlesworth is an ex\-Airbus specialist with expertise in unmanned aerial vehicles \(UAVs\) and satellite communications, bringing a wealth of industry experience. Prof Nagar, who leads the team has several decades of experience in mathematics and its application to research problems; while Drs. Gurvinder and Anicho also come with industry experience and broad understanding of telecommunications, and application of algorithms within the domain. Anicho also has expertise in the policy and regulatory dimension and uses this to track changes within that domain. 

 Different technology\-related challenges hinder the maturity of HAPS as a communications infrastructure solution. These research challenges range from addressing what form the HAPS should assume \(e.g. fixed\-wing aircraft, balloon or aerostats\), security, energy, payload designs, integration with aviation traffic, autonomy & coordination of platforms and spectrum allocation issues. At LHU we have focused on developing computer\-based HAPS models and simulation platforms to address some of the earlier mentioned problems **\[R1\] \[R2\]**. Specifically, our HAPS simulation platform enables us to investigate the viability of solar\-powered fixed\-wing variants of HAPS. We also investigate algorithms and techniques for developing autonomous behaviours in HAPS specifically for semi or full autonomous coordination of multiple HAPS **\[R4\]**. 

 However, one overarching challenge looming over all HAPS research efforts especially for rural broadband connectivity is the spectrum policy issue. Spectrum availability or scarcity has the potential to either make or break HAPS as a viable communications infrastructure. Without more spectrum identification for HAPS at the ITU organised WRC, investors, governments and other stakeholders may change their positions on the technical or commercial viability of the technology. LHU through its HAPS research continued to communicate the viability of HAPS and ensured that key policymakers and Commonwealth government representatives were adequately informed on the potential of HAPS. Armed with insights from our research, we maintained a channel to communicate and influence the perception and policy positions of stakeholders on the need to address the spectrum allocation issues central to the success of HAPS globally.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Our underpinning research described in **Section 2** has two major routes to the four distinct and material impacts being claimed below. For instance, our public engagement activities improved policymakers’ perception and awareness of HAPS and subsequently translated to concrete policy positions favourable to the technology and its benefits. The impact also extended beyond decision\-makers and included improving the awareness of HAPS and its benefits for journalists and the general public through media\-based routes ensuring inclusion in the policy formulation process. 

 **\(a\) Shaping Perception and Improving the Awareness of HAPS among Policymakers:** LHU HAPS research influenced policy positions of Commonwealth countries on HAPS spectrum allocations by shaping perception, improving awareness and knowledge of the technology, especially in the context of addressing rural connectivity issues. It has also contributed to disseminating the awareness of this technology to the public through deliberate public engagement activities and media interest. 

 CTO invited LHU to take up the challenge of engaging the participating countries and making a case for HAPS by addressing specific and general perception, and knowledge and policy issues surrounding the technology. This invitation came as a result of CTO noticing our contribution to the development of HAPS and its potentials for addressing rural connectivity challenges. The goal was for us to use our expertise and insights on HAPS to influence and guide policy positions of policymakers from various Commonwealth countries in preparation for the 2019 World Radio Conference \(WRC\-2019\). To ensure maximal impact from our engagement with CTO member countries/delegates we communicated our views and guidance using effective communication methods especially by using non\-technical and easily understandable language. We also put HAPS in the right context for rural connectivity challenges and contemporary solutions, clearly defining HAPS’s uniqueness and potentials to address the digital divide. The platform enabled us to create awareness and influence policy positions of delegates from different continents and setting the agenda for HAPS that would likely project into the future, affecting how thousands or even millions of people access connectivity in their rural locations. 

 **\(b\) Translating Improved Awareness and Clarity into tangible adjustments in HAPS Policy Positions:** The former Group Director of UK Spectrum Policy at Ofcom, who currently advises various governments, regulators and ministers on ICT matters, affirmed his familiarity with the policy positions of Commonwealth nations’ delegates and their stance on HAPS and related issues, and stated that *“Dr. Anicho’s work and presentations on HAPS at these Commonwealth forums is helping policymakers adjust their attitudes towards HAPS as reflected in their positive policy positions on spectrum identifications for HAPS – particularly across Africa”;* **\[S1\].** 

 It is important that policymakers and regulators understand the HAPS technology better and how it may impact existing fixed satellite services \(FSS\) or other applications. HAPS adoption and general success depended on favourable adoption of the proposed HAPS spectrum identifications at the 2019 WRC. The Acting Secretary\-General of the CTO **\[S3\]**, confirmed the usefulness of the LHU HAPS research *“in terms of providing awareness of the technology and its various applications and use cases.”* She further noted that the LHU presentations and panel discussions had struck chords with key policymakers and cited exemplar feedback from these delegates \(including ministers, deputy ministers and directors from a range of countries\) **\[S3\]:** 

-  *“I have a better appreciation for satellites and HAPS solution”* 

-  *“New knowledge on HAPs will be used to finalise World Radio Conference \(WRC\-19\) preparation”* 

-  *“Clarity formulating policy around spectrum pricing and HAPs”.* 

 The CTO Acting Secretary\-General also affirmed that *“as a result of these engagements delegates and by extension member countries have more clarity on their HAPS policy directions especially as the global telecommunications community prepare for the WRC\-19 in Egypt.”* **\[S3\].** She expressed confidence on behalf of CTO that the work would “ *ultimately contribute favourably to the policy positions on HAPS from Commonwealth states*”. As she further noted, these states “ *make up a sizeable chunk of the global telecommunications community*”. 

 **\(c\) Influence on Policymakers from the Commonwealth bloc yields the desired HAPS Policy outcome at the 2019 World Radio Conference \(WRC\-19\) in Egypt:** Our HAPS research contributed to keeping the HAPS discussion at the very centre of policy and regulatory deliberations leading up to the 2019 World Radio Conference \(WRC\) in Egypt. Through our input at the CTO organised forums, we were able to share insights and provide guidance to policymakers and regulators from the Commonwealth bloc. The outcome of LHU’s contribution ultimately resulted in favourable HAPS policy by the Commonwealth countries and supported the approval of the HAPS spectrum allocation proposal at WRC\-2019. 

 As confirmed by the Managing Director of Jamaica Spectrum Management Authority \(SMA\), a member of the Jamaica delegation to WRC\-2019, and one of the policymakers we engaged at CTO, HAPS proposal at WRC\-2019 was a success **\[S4\].** The current and previous HAPS spectrum allocations before WRC\-2019 is shown in **Figure 2**; the additional spectrum allocated to HAPS is significant considering the difficulty involved in shaping and aligning international consensus along 

this direction. 

 **\(d\) Improving Awareness and Perspective of HAPS among Media Practitioners \(and by extension the General Public\) as well as HAPS Industry; resulting in an important chain in Policy formulation and continued support:** The LHU research through its public engagement activities, and particularly media interest in the research has resulted in HAPS awareness reaching different segments of the public across countries; **\[S5\-S6\].** For instance, a technology writer for *The National*, UAE \(circulation: 65,000\), mentioned our research in his write\-up **\[S5\].** The journalist stated that our engagement was *“invaluable in improving my awareness of the technology and the realities of its development”*; considering the role of journalists and the media in shaping and informing policy, we consider our work having an impact within this important demography as significant **\[S5\].** As a result of these press coverages, which was widely circulated, we were approached by the Director of Regulatory Affairs at Avealto Plc. \(a UK based HAPS manufacturer\) for collaborative work and advice; the Director commented **\[S7\]** that: “ *The awareness and policy framing content of the LHU research around the implementation of HAPS is helping AVEALTO to reassess our perspective of current challenges and alternative ways of thinking about the problems*.” This demonstrates the reach and significance of the impact on the technical work with the industry and continued support.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Stem cell research is providing new avenues for both therapy and diagnosis but has been limited by the low availability of high\-quality, affordable and consistent growth factors, which are required to maintain stem cells in culture. Using his expertise in basic research on growth factors, Dr Hyvönen at the University of Cambridge has developed a platform that represents a step\-change in the production of growth factors through research undertaken between 2006 and 2019. His methodology for producing large amounts of high\-quality growth factors led to the establishment of his spin\-out company Qkine in 2016. This has since grown to encompass a portfolio of 16 products, employing 10 staff and exporting growth factors to Europe, Asia and North America. Qkine has generated \[text removed for publication\] in total sales and has generated over GBP 2,000,000 in venture capital investment.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Activins are growth factors that bind specific cell receptors to control many cellular behaviors, including tissue growth and function. Activins are essential for maintaining stem cell pluripotency, making them of considerable importance in stem cell research and its clinical outputs. Progress in the field of stem cell research has laid the foundation for cell\-based therapies of disease that cannot be cured by conventional medicines \(Mahla, Int. J Cell Biol., 2016\) but in order to meet this potential, research and clinical development need stable cell systems with which to work. 

 Activin signalling is regulated by the activin\-binding protein follistatin, an important antagonist in the extracellular matrix, which neutralises activin’s actions. However, activin also induces follistatin expression, generating a negative feedback loop that limits the extent and duration of activin signalling, restricting its use. Upregulation of Activin A \(made of two alpha subunits; activin B is two beta subunits; activin AB is one of each\), drives pluripotent stem cells into a mesoendodermal fate, i.e. early developmental and able to form all cell lineages, and thus provides a useful tool for stem cell differentiation and organoid formation. 

 Dr Marko Hyvönen at the University of Cambridge has dedicated research towards understanding activin A signalling at the molecular level. This required the production of significant quantities of activin A, but relied on methods that yield very little active protein. This led to Dr Hyvönen developing his own novel method capable of generating large amounts of high quality activin A. By 2003 Dr Hyvönen had developed and refined this core technology, enabling him to determine some of the first structures of activin A in complex with follistatin \[R1\]. He was able to do this entirely animal\-free, the first time this had been achieved. This new production method, which does not rely on the use of animal\-derived products, means the growth factors can be used for clinical grade human stem cell cultures.  Dr Hyvönen and colleagues made the unexpected finding that mutations at certain positions in the amino acid sequence of activin A dramatically increase the resistance of activin to follistatin inhibition without affecting its biological signalling activity, providing increased signalling potency in cell culture. Dr Hyvönen patented his methodology for producing a modified activin in 2018 \[R2\]. 

 Dr Hyvönen saw the opportunity to use this method to produce other growth factors and used the technology to synthesise proteins which are widely used in stem cell research. This includes bone morphogenic proteins \(BMPs\), which were being increasingly used in bone regeneration treatments but without an identified optimal delivery system. Dr Hyvönen and colleagues synthesised BMPs and combined them with a novel nanocomposite \(α\-TCP/PLGA\). They discovered the material produced osteo\-induction and had potential application as an osteo\-inductive agent in regenerative medicine \[R3\]. He also researched the interaction between BMPs and Gremlin\-1, which regulates BMP signalling. Little was known about the molecular mechanism by which Gremlin\-1 inhibits BMP signalling, but Dr Hyvönen and colleagues found that Gremlin\-1 inhibits BMP by a distinct mechanism compared to other known inhibitors which led to them proposing a novel model of interaction for BMP and Gremlin\-1. They found that Gremlin\-1 can attach to more than one BMP molecule at a time, so BMP and Gremlin\-1 form large complexes that assemble in alternating fashion \[R4\]. 

 In 2019, Dr. Hyvönen showed how this technology could be applied in organoid media, which is used to study how cells interact together, the effect of diseases and to test the effectiveness of drugs. His technology of expression in bacteria \[R5\] was able to produce highly pure recombinant Gremlin\-1 and R\-spondin\-1 growth factors, critical components in organoid media that were not previously widely available. In the course of this work it was clearly demonstrated that the new method was superior to anything else available in terms of yield and purity, and also could be more widely applied to other proteins.

1.  **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Hyvönen’s basic research at the University of Cambridge on growth factors enabled him to develop a new way of producing exceptionally high purity growth factors and cytokines necessary for stem cell research. In the current REF period, the commercialisation of this technology has led to the establishment of a new company in 2016 with the creation of 10 new jobs, new investment of over GBP2,000,000 and a catalogue of 15 specialised products generating income of \[text removed for publication\] in total sales. Continued success of licensing agreements generated revenues in the reporting period of \[text removed for publication\]. 

 **Economic impact** **and job creation** 

 In 2016 Dr Hyvönen established Qkine, a spin\-out company, to commercialise this new technology for high quality activin A proteins which fills a major gap in the market \[E1\]. The manufacture of these proteins was transferred to Qkine in 2017, which generated early revenue and was an important factor in attracting seed investment \[E1\]. Qkine has grown strongly and steadily, highlighted as one of the “10 Cambridge\-based start\-ups to look out for in 2019 and beyond” \[E2\]. Between December 2017 and April 2019, Qkine was embedded in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge. After successful completion of an Innovate UK funded project to develop growth factors for organoid culture \[E1\], Qkine received GBP 550,000 investment from Cambridge Enterprise and five angel investors which allowed it to open dedicated laboratories on the Cambridge Science Park in 2019 \[E3\]. Since 2016, Qkine has generated \[text removed for publication\] in total sales \[E1\]. Qkine now employs 10 staff including five scientists, marketing and scientific operations managers, and a senior management team of three \[E1\]. Dr Hyvönen continues to provide scientific guidance and practical insight to Qkine’s scientists as the company’s Chief Scientific Officer \(0.1 FTE\) and has supported the development of other high\-quality products \[E1\], described below. 

 **Products on the market** 

 Qkine’s product range now comprises 15 products, four of which were licensed from Dr Hyvönen’s lab \[E1\]. These include growth factors such as Gremlin\-1, a BMP inhibitor for several embryonic and organoid culture systems, and GDF15 \(human growth differentiation factor 15\), an exciting new cellular stress biomarker. Their latest offering, TGF \(transforming growth factor\) beta 1 is the first entirely animal\-free recombinant human version of this protein, which has been extensively tested for maintenance of iPSC pluripotency by the specialist stem cell biotechnology company, Stemnovate; this product represents a unique offering in the market by Qkine \[E4\]. 

 There are few primary manufacturers of the complex bioactive proteins made by Qkine, so the proprietary protein engineering and refolding technology developed from Dr Hyvönen’s research strengthens the supply chain for stem cell research, biotechnology and drug discovery assays, with a  [focus on quality in terms of specific bioactivity](https://qkine.com/2018/08/07/quality-is-not-just-purity/). When Qkine secured its latest investments \(details below\), Chief Investment Officer of Parkwalk, a leading investor in university spin\-out companies, commented: “There is a clear market need for high\-quality protein reagents, especially for applications in stem cell biology and organoid research. Qkine has…a compelling technology to meet this need…” highlighting the unique position held by the company in the market. \[E5\] 

 **Customer satisfaction** 

 Many of Qkine’s customers are based in the UK, however Qkine also serves a growing base of customers in mainland Europe and Nordic countries, Asia, the US and Canada \[E1\]. Customers are satisfied with the quality of products received from Qkine. The CEO of a customer, a biotech company specialising in the production of highly\-predictive human cell disease models based on stem cell technology, said that growth factors purchased from Qkine “have proved to be effective and reliable for the production of \[their\] cell products”. They use activin A as a central factor in their industrial process and find the cost “attractive compared to alternative suppliers”. They go on to say that “the consistency of supply, scale of supply and crucially the quality of the Qkine reagents do…confer a competitive advantage to Qkine in the stem cell reagent space. Procurement of quality reagents from Qkine has been an important aspect of generating products for \[our\] customer base, and we will continue to use them as a trusted supplier of high\-quality reagents.” as part of the production of their disease models for global pharma, biotech companies in Europe, the US and Japan, and academic groups. \[E6\] 

 **Investment** 

 The ability to supply high quality activin A protein commercially was important for generating early revenue and helped attract seed investment \[E1\]. In 2017, the company was awarded an Innovate UK grant worth GBP 68,500 for its next generation growth factors for organoid\-driven precision medicine \[E7\]. In 2018, Qkine won a place on Accelerate@Babraham, a new initiative designed to support ambitious early\-stage life science ventures, providing GBP 20,000 of non\-dilutive funding, initial laboratory and office space, mentoring and business support \[E7\]. Since 2016, Qkine has secured investment worth more than GBP 2,000,000, including GBP 1,500,000 in June 2020 \[E3, E8\]. Their international customer base will expand due to this recent investment, which will allow them to roll out full commercial operations in East Asia, the US and Europe \[E9\]. 

 **Licensing agreements and direct protein sales** 

 Technology derived from Dr Hyvönen’s research has yielded continuing royalties through several licensing agreements. Production of mature, bioactive activin A from *E.coli* was licensed to \[text removed for publication\] in 2009; technology for producing an engineered form of activin A was also licensed to \[text removed for publication\] in 2011; in 2005 Dr Hyvönen provided purified activin B to a senior professor at \[text removed for publication\]. The total royalties received for licences to Dr Hyvönen’s inventions in the reporting period 2013\-2020 is \[text removed for publication\]. \[E9\] 

 **Translation of research** 

 The provision of purified activin B to \[text removed for publication\] in 2005, enabled the development of a highly sensitive diagnostic assay for inhibin B, a key test for fertility clinics linked to the involvement of activin and inhibin in regulation of the menstrual cycle and, specifically, follicle maturation. The assay exclusively licensed to \[text removed for publication\], a US corporation, which manufactures, markets and distributes the assay in many territories worldwide \[E11. Since the second\-half of 2013, \[text removed for publication\] have had annual sales of the assay totalling \[text removed for publication\] \[E11\]. 

 Dr Hyvönen has taken his expertise in fundamental knowledge of cell biology, and research conducted at the University of Cambridge, to develop technology that represents a step\-change in the production of growth factors, meeting a demand from those working in areas such as stem cell research, regenerative medicine, and diagnostics. Through commercial endeavours his work has led to provision of necessary reagents, with downstream benefits, as well as direct economic outcomes such as job creation.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Enteral tubes \(ET\) bypassing the mouth are utilized where patients are unable to swallow. ETs are used to deliver food and drink directly into the intestines and can also be used to administer medication. However, most therapeutics are not formulated for ET delivery, and it is therefore often necessary to manipulate medicines \(e.g. crush tablets\) to enable medicines to be passed through an ET. Such practice voids the safe drug use licence and results in the unlicensed administration of medicines. 

 UEA research has highlighted that people with ETs are at very high risk of medication error due to the need to manipulate medicines prior to administration. This research led to **Professor** **David** **Wright** advising \(in 2014\) the Medicines & Health Regulatory Agency on licensing processes and a subsequent revision to its licensing standards. 

 In collaboration with Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, this research led to the development and licencing of thirteen new liquid drug formulations for ET administration across the UK, which have supported Rosemont Pharmaceuticals sales to grow by 230% \(from GBP18,0000,000 to GBP42,000,000\) between 2004 and 2019. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Swallowing difficulties \(dysphagia\) arises from numerous medical conditions associated with ageing e.g., Parkinson’s disease, dementia and stroke. Different grades of clinical dysphagia affect more than 1 in 6 people over the age of 65. This inability to swallow results in a significant proportion of this population receiving their food and medicines via ETs. Within hospitals, ETs are also used when patients are unconscious and unable to receive food and liquids by mouth. For these patients the formulation of the drug in a liquid form is as important as the medication itself \( **3.1, 3.2**\). 

 Research by **Professor David Wright’s** research group in the School of Pharmacy at UEA has highlighted that whilst healthcare professionals focussed their attention on nutrition and hydration, appropriate and safe administration of medicines was often overlooked. The research identified that when nurses were required to administer medicines via enteral tubes, the standard practice was to either disperse tablets and capsules in water or administer a liquid medicine prior to administration \( **3.3, 3.4**\). Such practices were performed outside of the medicine’s license and were associated with significant increases in risk in medication error and with the potential for increased risk of ET blockage, which can necessitate new tube insertion by surgical procedure. Furthermore, due to the wide range of options available when choosing to undertake unlicensed administration, the process was found to vary significantly depending on the administrator \( **3.2, 3.5**\). 

 UEA research specifically identified that administration of medicines to patients with dysphagia was not optimal \( **3.2, 3.3**\). Several factors conspired here, including inadequate knowledge of how to administer medicines, and lack of skill in mixing medicines for ET delivery \( **3.3, 3.4**\). This research highlighted that, excluding time errors, the normalised frequency of medicine administration errors for patients with dysphagia was 21.1% compared with 5.9% for patients without \( **3.3**\). Furthermore, the results highlighted that there was a significantly increased risk of medication errors \(P < 0.001\) for patients with dysphagia \(excluding patients with enteral tubes\). In dysphagia patients with enteral tubes, there was a further increase in the risk of medication error \(P < 0.001\) \( **3.3**\). 

 The main concerns with respect to administration of medicines via ETs were found to be tube blockage and loss of active ingredient on the tube during administration. The research identified that the principal reason for these outcomes was the limited availability of licensed medicines suitable for administration via ETs \( **3.2**\) **.** A key recommendation of the research was to administer drugs in formulations that are specifically designed not to block ETs in an unaltered state. These recommendations would decrease the risk of errors and, furthermore, the possibility of additional \(avoidable\) surgical procedures would be significantly reduced. 

 Key conclusions of the UEA research are that improvements in interprofessional communication are needed to improve medicine administration to dysphagic patients, and that there is a need for continuing professional development in medicine administration to provide greater understanding of the contra\-indications of combining medications and of the significant legal implications of altering formulations.

 4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Effecting safer drug administration</ins> <ins>to patients**</ins> 

 Nurses, midwives and health visitors are advised not to crush medication. However, there are occasions where a patient is unable to swallow solid oral dosage forms. In such instances, it may be necessary to crush tablets or open capsules. Crushing medication or opening capsules prior to administration results in unlicensed administration. Under the Human Medicines Regulations \(2012\) only licensed prescribers can authorise the administration of unlicensed medicines. It may therefore be illegal for other healthcare professionals \(HCP\) to open a capsule or crush a tablet before administration without the authorisation of the prescriber. Where such administration results in harm to the patient, then the manufacturer has no liability for any harm that ensues, and if the unlicensed administration is unauthorised by the prescribing doctor then liability may lie solely with the administering HCP. 

 In 2019, **Wright** chaired a national working party to develop clinical guidelines for use by healthcare professionals when administering medicines via ETs \( **Source** **5.1**\). In line with Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) recommendations, these guidelines state: 

 “*When choosing a new drug, follow due diligence and use clinical judgement: – medicines licensed for administration by enteral feeding tube should be used first line.*” 

 \( **Source** **5.1** **page 4**\) 

 Chief Pharmacists from NHS hospital trusts have confirmed that this is being implemented in contemporary NHS practice: 

 *“Best practice and advice from the MHRA dictates that we always use a licensed product where one exists… Given the option of a licensed versus unlicensed product, professional standards and responsibilities for quality assurance will always guide us to use the licensed one, even if there is a cost implication. Having a licensed liquid available to us gives assurance that it can be administered safely via an enteral tube”* 

 *“It is always preferable to use a licensed liquid preparation, if this is available. The reasons for this are that the licensed preparation will be on the commercial market and are therefore readily available at short notice. Licensed medicinal products will also have been tested to ensure that it is a standardised preparation that is clearly labelled and will reliably deliver the stated dose within the shelf life of the product.”* 

 \( **Source 5.2**\) 

 In 2013, **Wright** secured funding from Rosemont Pharmaceuticals to develop education and training materials which supported the relaunch of the  [swallowingdifficulties.com](http://www.swallowingdifficulties.com/) website. This is an online go\-to for patients and HCP to obtain information and guidance on dysphagia and liquid medicines. The website has received over 1 million international webpage views \(with users split equally across the EU, USA and Asia with smaller percentages from Africa and Oceania\). Information specifically for patients is accessed 40% of the time, with 20% information for prescribers. \( **Source** **5.3**\) 

 The education grants also facilitated the development and delivery of a massive open on\-line course \(MOOC\) entitled “Dysphagia: Swallowing Difficulties and Medicines”. The MOOC seeks to disseminate best clinical practice to patients, carers and healthcare professionals administering medicines to people with dysphagia. The MOOC is delivered over five weeks and has been accessed by over 30,000 patients and healthcare professionals from 181 countries and dependencies. \( **Source** **5.4**\) 

 <ins> **Developing</ins> <ins>the first licensed liquid medicine</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>for ET administration**</ins> 

 UEA researchers collaborated with the senior management team at Rosemont Pharmaceuticals – a specialist company that manufactures and sells liquid medicines globally – on a strategy to license specific liquid medicines for ET administration. 

 “*In 2005 we invited Prof Wright to present his findings at a Rosemont round table event, at which he recommended the company to consider licensing liquids specifically for administration via enteral tubes \- at the time no liquid medicines were approved for this route of administration.*"" \( **Source 5.5**\). 

 In order to deliver this business plan, senior regulatory team members from Rosemont, with **Wright** as an expert witness, were invited to MHRA in 2014 to discuss and agree a new process for the licensing of liquid medicines for administration via the ET route \( **Source 5.6**\). Research undertaken by Wright \( **3.6**\) was used to underpin and inform the methods used by Rosemont to secure their ET administration licenses \( **Source 5.6**\). 

 “*The work originally done by Rebecca White who was Prof Wright’s PhD student investigating how to set up the testing rig and advice on the types of tubing and materials, plus techniques used to administer drugs via feeding tubes helped Rosemont develop a sound method of testing, that gave robust and repeatable results*.” 

 \( **Source 5.6**\) 

 Importantly, the research undertaken in the **Wright\-Rosemont** collaboration contributed to the MHRA benchmark used when considering license approval of other liquid medicines for ET approval that are submitted by other companies. 

 *“As a result of the discussion, the MHRA was confident that the proposed approach would not only provide an appropriate way of testing to allow assessment by the regulatory authorities, but would also set the bar for the testing that would be required for all marketing authorisations, requiring that route of administration.”* 

 \( **Source 5.6**\) 

 Having secured MHRA agreement for the proposal, Rosemont were the first company to apply for, and secure, UK licencing approval to market and supply liquid medicines for ET administration to dysphagia patients. Rosemont currently has thirteen licensed liquid medicines including seven drugs at different doses that embrace a broad range of therapeutics used to treat many of the most common diseases, ranging from high blood pressure and infections to epilepsy and pain. 

 As the UK’s largest specialist liquid medicine manufacturer, Rosemont used the licenses for these new products to maintain its market share **\(Source 5.5\)**. According to Rosemont, specific licensing for ETs: 

 *“...has allowed us to retain customers and reduce the severe price erosion, because we have added something clinically useful to these products.”* \( **Source 5.5**\) 

 The importance of **Wright**’s research to Rosemont’s development of licensed liquid medicines is recognised by the company 

 *“…Prof Wright played a pivotal role in Rosemont’s decision to be the first company to develop and license formulations for enteral tube administration. Our work with prof. Wright since 2004 has provided a solid platform for Rosemont to drive product sales and disseminate clinical best practice in medicines administration to patients with dysphagia. In this time period, the sales of Rosemont liquid medicines have more than doubled from £18m to £42m, representing a significant increase in our company turnover”* \( **Source 5.5**\). 

 There is evidence of other companies licensing their medicines for administration via the ET route in recent years. For example, Colonis Pharma, Bayer, and other pharmaceutical manufacturers have secured UK licensing for ET administration of their products. In 2018, ITF Pharma secured FDA approval for ET administration of riluzole in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the United States \( **Source 5.7**\). 

 <ins> **Improving healthcare outcomes with mitigated risks, legal challenge and cost**</ins> 

 Unlicensed administration of crushed tables or capsule powders via ETs can cause drug delivery to inappropriate sites for drug absorption \(stomach vs lower intestine\) and unintended drug interactions, for example, between different drugs, between drug and feeds or between the drug and tube \( **3.1\-3.5**\). The development of new licenced products, applicable to a broad spectrum of symptoms/conditions, is ensuring that these medicines are being delivered with optimal efficacy, and thus realising their full therapeutic potential. 

 Crushed tablets can cause ETs to block \( **3.1\-3.5**\). The availability of ET\-specific formulations, developed through the **Wright\-Rosemont** collaboration, obviate these blockages. Avoiding ET blockage removes surgical \(and post\-surgery infection\) risks and reduces hospital costs associated with clinical management of tube blockage and reinsertion. 

 In summary, increased availability of medicines licensed for administration via ET simplifies practitioner decision\-making, reduces the opportunity for error in the preparation of unlicensed medicines through e.g. tablet crushing and removes the possibility of legal challenge. Thus, the development, licencing and increased availability of ET\-specific formulations are improving patient care and protecting thousands of nurses, midwives and health visitors from potential legal action.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Working in partnership with a leading communications provider, Telecom Italia, software and modelling developed at the University of Nottingham were applied to real\-life wireless communication scenarios to inform operational planning in the rollout of 5G in Italy. 

 Research confirmed that electromagnetic fields \(EMF\) transitioning from outdoor\-to\-indoor environments would remain under Italy’s exposure limit of 6V/m. \[TEXT REDACTED\] 

 The same underpinning research informs the design and manufacturing process for a range of complex structures for minimised noise and vibration, including tractor cabins \(Yanmar Ltd\) and others through new licensed software \(inuTech\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Simulating the distribution of electromagnetic and vibro\-acoustic wave energy in complex structures \(e.g. buildings, vehicles, networks of internet\-enabled devices\) at high frequencies is extremely challenging for standard numerical tools, such as Finite or Boundary Element Methods and Finite Difference Time Domain methods, due to the large scales and time\-consuming calculations required. 

 Professor Tanner began researching alternative methods in 2008, developing *Dynamical Energy Analysis* \(DEA\). DEA approximates wave transport in terms of ray dynamics which is described using linear phase space operators **\[1\]**. In 2013, Professor Tanner and Dr Stephen Creagh formed the *Wave Modelling Research Group \(WAMO\)* with the *George Green Institute for Electromagnetics Research* of the Faculty of Engineering. Dr Gradoni joined WAMO in the same year. WAMO has enhanced Nottingham’s reputation for wave modelling, introducing methods such as DEA combined with Wigner function techniques, and the transfer operator formalism in engineering contexts. 

 The WAMO electromagnetic wave modelling research led by Dr Gradoni and Professor Tanner consists of novel high\-frequency asymptotic methods based on DEA developed to simulate energy transfer in large\-scale scenarios \(e.g. buildings, cities, vehicles\) and small\-scale scenarios \(e.g. chip\-to\-chip wireless communications inside internet\-enabled devices\). 

 **Large\-scale scenarios** 

 In 2015, to support the planning and roll out of 5G in Italy **\[10\]**, a simplified version of DEA, the power balance method based on impedances simulations within the random coupling model \(RCM\), was used to predict the signal energy leakage between two adjacent rooms coupled through windows and doors **\[2\]**. 

 DEA can also be used to simulate the distribution of vibrational and acoustic wave energy in vehicles. In vehicle cabins, for example, it is an efficient way to ensure the safe design of vehicles, including reducing unwanted movement and lowering sound levels that may otherwise damage human hearing, as well as to maintain comfort. In these scenarios, the basic DEA algorithm **\[1\]** is applied to a mesh **\[6\]**. Since 2015, this method has been further refined for efficiency **\[7\]** and extended to 3D **\[8\]**. 

 **Small\-scale scenarios** 

 Working in collaboration with industry partners, DEA has been extended to simulate energy transfer between EMF in small\-scale environments \(chip\-to\-chip interconnects within printed circuit boards and device\-to\-device communications within networks\) using RCM\-based channel matrices **\[3, 11\]**. 

 **Linking small\- to large\-scale scenarios** 

 Professor Tanner and Dr Gradoni developed techniques using DEA based on the Wigner function method **\[4, 5, 9\]** to link wireless energy transfer from small\-scale electronics such as smartphones and tablets to large\-scale environments such as buildings and cities.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research by WAMO has informed operational planning, and research and development in international industry settings. The main impact has been on: 

-  Communications \- extensions to the DEA energy propagation model have been used by the telecommunications industry and service providers to address challenges in modelling 5G. 

-  Manufacturing – the same DEA extensions have been used to simulate the distribution of vibrational and acoustic wave energy in vehicles to enable optimal vibro\-acoustic design of vehicles. 

 **1\) Communications** 

 **Enabling the rollout of 5G in Italy** 

 An exponential increase in the number of mobile communications devices has been accompanied by an accelerated spread and increase in the density of urban environments, and a greater demand from users for higher network speeds. 5G deployment is expected to create a market value of USD 33.72 Billion by 2026 \( [The IT Infrastructure Report](https://bit.ly/2NAdDp4), 2020\). 

 Italian legislation published in 2003 **\[D, page 3\]** imposed an electromagnetic exposure limit of 6V/m in the environment. This arbitrary limit is very strict \(restrictively so for telecommunication operators\) compared to the International Commission on Non\-Ionizing Radiation Protection \(ICNIRP\) which advises an exposure limit of 41V/m **\[C\]**. Ordinances published in 2012 **\[D, n.245, page 13, 14 and n.294, page 89\]**, 2014 **\[D, n.262, page 61\]**, and 2016 **\[D, n. 252, page 6, 9\]** progressively increased restrictions on emitted EMF, that significantly constricted operational planning of the 4G and later 5G rollout in Italy. The 2016 ordinance **\[D, page 6, 9\]** was particularly restrictive and problematic for the telecommunications industry as it assumed that walls and windows did not have any blocking effect and did not reduce the wireless signal entering a building. 

 In collaboration with Telecom Italia, WAMO models were used to predict EMF by considering the effects of room\-coupling and absorption by the building walls, as well as interference caused by complex geometry and irradiation structures within the room. *“In addition to accurately measuring the difference between \[outdoor and indoor\] environments, WAMO models predicted that the EMF indoors would remain under 6V/m even after the roll\-out of 5G...WAMO models predicted that EMF levels in the indoor environment had been largely overestimated by the model which informed the 2016 ordinance and that building geometry and walls significantly lower EMF indoors compared to outdoors. Thanks to the WAMO study, Telecom Italia recognised that the 2016 ordinance assumed a wall absorption value in the outdoor\-to\-indoor transition that was mathematically inaccurate and too restrictive from an operational point of view*.” **\[B\]** 

 \[TEXT REDACTED\] The Global System for Mobile Communications \(GSMA, the industry organisation that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide\) reported in their case study for Italy that as much as 64% of the antenna network would have been rendered unusable for Long Term\-Evolution \(i.e. for transition to 5G and beyond\) under the 2016 ordinance **\[C, page 3\].** 

 More recently in collaboration with British Telecom, WAMO's research has identified that reflective surfaces could play a role in overcoming areas of poor radio coverage \(known as not\-spots\) in the roll out of 5G, changing operational planning. *“The work being done \[by Gradoni on the fellowship\] to simulate the use of reflective surfaces...is important not just for the testbed project...but also for the wider industry... To overcome not\-spots, operators typically erect additional masts and antennas, at great cost to the industry. If reflective surfaces are able to play even a small part in improving coverage without the use of additional antennas, the operational saving could be very significant.”* **\[K\]** 

 In addition, the research has led to the creation of an international professional standard **,**  [the IEEE Guide](https://standards.ieee.org/project/2718.html) \(accessed on 27 November 2020\).This publication is the first standard providing practitioners and professional services with best practice guidance on near\-field measurement methods and characterisation of stochastic electromagnetic fields emitted by complex multifunctional electronics. It is designed to be used as a reference protocol for conducting tests on electronic devices in any accredited laboratory, with certification of compliancy provided in accordance with national scale limits. The chair for the Working Group for the IEEE Guide Development expects “... *final publication within 2021...”* **\[A\]**. 

 **Developing new telecommunications hardware in Europe** 

 The research has also had impact on telecommunications partners elsewhere in Europe. For NXP Semiconductors \(France\), WAMO provided the simulation technology to conceive a radically different new hardware architecture for \(multi\-antenna\) wireless interconnects for high\-capacity chip\-to\-chip data transfer within the confined environment of digital devices. “... *we can use \[it\] as a prototype in the development of future hardware solutions to be provided to and embedded by partner organisations in new IoT \[devices\]*” **\[E\]**. In Germany, IMST GmbH used the same research to produce accurate energy propagation maps in fields dominated by noise, which were explored in view of IMST’s EMPIRE software optimisation **\[F\]**. Both organisations have adopted the “C2C” design guidelines developed during the Nottingham\-led NEMF21 project and acknowledged the role they have played in shaping strategy **\[E, F\].** 

 **2\) Manufacturing** 

 **Reducing noise and vibration in vehicles** 

 At Yanmar Ltd \(a Japanese diesel engine manufacturer\), the software has been adopted to effect design changes to tractor models that minimise noise and vibration; in particular: “ *…on our new YM3 tractor series informed by the DEA simulations undertaken in house \(since 2018\). More recently \(February 2020\), the design changes led to a structural modification that ensured the YM3 tractor series is in compliance with EU noise level for drivers legislation \(directive 2009/76/EC\)”* **\[H\]**. Between 2015\-2018, Yanmar committed GBP120,000 to DEA research published in **\[7\]**. “ *...the research has brought about efficiency savings as the company is able to minimize noise and vibration inside the tractor cabin at an earlier stage of design and does not have to rely on less accurate methods that can lead to costly redesigns”* and “ *the DEA R&D tool has been very successful in positioning Yanmar as a company who cares for their customers at work*” **\[H\]**. 

 Between 2009 and 2012, inuTech GmbH \(a German computer software company\) invested more than EUR160,000 in the development of the DEA technology and the grant MHiVec **\[15\]** *“allowed for development of substantial additional R&D efforts to adapt the DEA software to the requirements of the automotive industry and other transport sectors”* and further investment of *more than EUR150,000 was used on staff hiring and training as well as marketing efforts and networking with potential customers*”. Since 2016, the software has been marketed under an Assignment and Revenue Agreement **\[I\]**. More recently, Romax Technology, a leading gearbox designer and manufacturer, committed GBP24,000 to a PhD CASE studentship and a further GBP90,000 in\-kind licensing their software to further develop DEA in their applications **\[J\]**.

 Through personal narratives of those with dyslexia, the ‘Languishing to Thriving’ model was developed. This theoretical framework suggests that those with languishing dyslexia face challenges with anxiety, avoidant obstacle\-related behaviours, perceive criticisms negatively and engage in self\-depreciation when experiencing failure, whilst those thriving; embrace challenges, use signature strengths to overcome, learn from criticisms and persevere when met with failure by finding alternative methods \[1\]. As a positive psychology intervention \(PPI\), participants were signposted to the Values in Action \(VIA\) Strengths Survey, to identify their signature strengths. The host website presents a dyslexia friendly interface; allowing users to alter font type, colour and size \[1\]. The model uses a PPI to promote ‘Desirable Dyslexia’ by encouraging people to utilise their signature strengths. The research team used an interdisciplinary approach, which concluded that there is scope for the application of positive psychology to dyslexia \[2 & 3\]. 

 Continuation of this research involved the ‘Languishing to Thriving’ model being applied to students in general. The framework suggests that the languishing student may experience; fixed mind\-set, learned helplessness, focus on weaknesses, low grit and low self\-control. Whereas the thriving student may experience; growth mindedness, learned optimism, focuses on strengths, grit and self\-control. This research explored the importance of the concept of grit in university students, using a mixed methods approach. Three studies explored traits in undergraduate and postgraduate students which contribute to grit, for example; self\-control, mental well\-being, life satisfaction, feelings of worth, resilience, growth mind\-set, perceived stress, and perseverance/time management skills, amongst other. This evidenced the usefulness of measuring constructs such as grit and mental well\-being, in reference to student success and academic performance \[4\]. 

 <ins>Bolton Uni\-Stride scale \(BUSS\)</ins> 

 The team developed a specific 12 item measure of tenacity \(seven items\) and self\-composure \(5 items\); two constructs crucial to academic success. The Bolton Uni\-Stride scale \(BUSS\), included items relating to mental health and signature strengths use. The measure evidenced good internal consistency and test\-retest reliability. The research team suggests that this measure of academic tenacity will be a more effective measure of academic success than competing measures \[5\]. 

 Based literature evidencing rising mental health issues in schools, and the efficacy of PPI in secondary schools, the Hummingbird Project as developed; a psychoeducational PPI, delivered to schools in Greater Manchester in collaboration with the charity, Mediquip4kids. 

 <ins>Hummingbird Project</ins> 

 Hummingbird Phase One was the pilot study delivered to two schools \(n=90\). It consisted of 8 weekly, 1 hour sessions and included positive psychology topics. Participants completed the World Health Organisation Five Well\-Being Index \(WHO\-5\), Grit Scale \(GRIT\), Bolton Uni\-Stride Scale \(BUSS\), Children’s Hope Scale \(CHS\) and the purpose made Hummingbird Life Satisfaction Scale \(HLSS\) questionnaires for pre and post test results, and used work books for class sessions and at home. Hummingbird Phase Two was delivered to 14 schools \(n=1054\). Sessions were condensed to 6 weekly, 1 hour sessions and GRIT was excluded as an outcome measure. Outcomes evidenced positive changes in mental health, using a pre and posttest design \[6\].

 <ins>Languishing to Thriving</ins> 

 The ‘Languishing to Thriving’ model was applied to people with dyslexia and evidenced that the PPI of the VIA strengths survey encouraged users to overcome obstacles using their signature strengths. The model was reported by the local news media, after the manuscript was published \(Frontiers in Psychology\) and was presented a TedX talk at the University of Bolton. 

 The VIA strengths survey website was modified to have a dyslexia friendly interface was made available to the general public in 2014, freely accessible for those with dyslexia to utilise \(A\). 

 Margaret Rooke published a book named ‘Creative Successful Dyslexic \(B\).’ Margaret promoted the book at presentations for dyslexic success in the UK and wrote an article for the BDA, naming Kannangara as a key researcher in the field and citing the initial research. Emails of feedback were received stating how it resonated with and was beneficial for people with dyslexia and how the information had been dispersed by attendees and used by others. 

 Kannangara was invited to deliver a speech for the British Dyslexia Association \(BDA\) on “Dyslexia Creates 2019 – *a conference in collaboration with the V&A on the creative power of dyslexia and how organisations can capitalise on it*,” advocating the success of those with dyslexia. 

 <ins>National and International Engagement</ins> 

 Kannangara and Carson attended a two\-day workshop organised by the Department of Psychology, Jain University, Bangalore, India to deliver two sessions on Positive Psychology to staff and students. The first focused on mental well\-being and the second on ‘Desirable Dyslexia \(C\).’ 

 Research surrounding positive psychology interventions for grit and well\-being, Kannangara gave a presentation on positive psychology interventions in counselling at the International Conference on Applied Psychology \(ICAP\),Sri Lanka \(2017; D\). 

 Three members of the of the Counselling Unit of Brac University \(BracU\), Bangladesh, \(E\) attended the workshops and stated that the information included in the workshop would be beneficial for both the client and the organisation when implemented; 

 *Overall these workshops endorse the skills in counselling practice by applying the approaches of the positive psychology which will be helpful for the person as well as the organization.* 

 Kannangara and Waugh had an audio interview with faculti.net, an academic and learning platform offering insights from academic and industry experts \(F\). The focus of the interview was the importance of the concept of grit in university students \(2020\). 

 <ins>The Humming Bird Project</ins> 

 After becoming aware of the research team and their topicality, a Manchester based charity named Mediquip4kids, who, “ *improves the health of babies and children in the UK by providing equipment not available from limited NHS resources*,” working collaboratively with Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services \(CAMHS\) made contact. From this, the research team worked in collaboration with organisations to deliver the Hummingbird Project \(G\). Mediquip4kids received £53,953 in grants to develop, coordinate and deliver the Hummingbird Project collaboratively with the research team. 

 An evaluation of the Hummingbird project evidenced positive results from the PPI. Hummingbird Phase 1 evidenced a significant increase in wellbeing \(WHO\-5\) but only slight improvement in all other outcomes. In Phase 2, the pre and posttest results evidence a significant, positive change in all outcome measures. Results show that the average child who has taken part in the project has improved wellbeing \(WHO\-5\), improved levels of resilience \(BUSS\), and increased levels of hope for the future \(CHS\). The results from the purpose designed HLSS evidenced an improved understanding of the topics covered \[6\]. 

 The project was mentioned in the Rudheath Senior Academy head teachers newsletter and commended by Metro Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham at the opening event as he voiced national concerns stating that \(H\); 

 *There’s a growing call from young people for more support with their own mental health and wellbeing, their own resilience, to navigate what out there is an increasingly challenging world.* 

 And in his opinion that is why 

 *…the Hummingbird Project is so right, so of the moment. It’s really answering the call coming from young people.* 

 Head teachers from the schools involved have given positive feedback and testimonials, explaining how the students have benefited from the project \(I\). 

 The next phase of the Hummingbird Project has been funded \(J\) to deliver the course to primary school students and to develop and disperse resources for parent engagement to encourage the continuity of good mental health, psychoeducation and well\-being of all students who participate. Due to the global outbreak the next phase has been delayed and will be continued when it is safe to do so.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Recent tsunami events have demonstrated the challenges in detecting and evaluating a tsunami threat, and the importance of communicating timely and accurate warning information to communities at risk. Research carried out by the University of Huddersfield in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and the Maldives established critical areas of capacity and processes for effective tsunami early warning and identified recommendations for improvements to early warning processes. The research has resulted in <ins>significant changes</ins> to: policy decisions on how tsunami preparedness is managed and assessed in 28 countries in the Indian Ocean region; priorities for capacity building of national agencies responsible for tsunami early warning; and, improved national processes and practices for tsunami early warning in Indonesia and Sri Lanka that are protecting coastal communities at risk. The <ins>extensive reach</ins> of the impact extends to 28 Indian Ocean countries and is helping to protect many of the estimated 800 million people that live in coastal areas surrounding the Indian Ocean.  It covers the wide range of agencies responsible for tsunami early warning at the regional, national and local levels, including the UN agency responsible for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System \(IOTWMS\), officially mandated national contact points, national and local government agencies responsible for disaster management, as well as meteorology services, emergency services and the media. The underpinning research and impact won the UK 2019 Newton Prize for Indonesia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Around the world, tsunami threat remains high. Scientists have warned that climate change will result in more tsunamis. The disaster risk index for tsunami is the highest of all hazards in Indonesia \(9.6\), the Maldives \(8.9\) and Sri Lanka \(8.2\). The 2018 tsunami events in Indonesia have reaffirmed the challenges in detecting and evaluating a tsunami threat, as well as in communicating timely, accurate warning information to communities at risk. 

 There has been considerable progress and improvement in the IOTWMS that has been developed since the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. However, the UN coordinating agency for the IOTWMS has formally recognised that much remains to be done to ensure dissemination of effective warnings and to prepare communities to act upon them. 

 Previous research has focused on disparate elements of the upstream and downstream warning chain, including technical studies to develop regional detection and monitoring infrastructure, and local studies on evacuation. The underpinning research is novel in focusing on the interface arrangements between upstream detection of a tsunami threat, and the downstream response. This interface is where regional tsunami threat information is evaluated by countries at the national or local levels, and decisions are taken on evacuations and what warning information is to be issued to local communities at risk. It typically involves a wide array of jurisdictional agencies and response partners, including regional tsunami service providers, tsunami national contact points, and a range of sub\-national emergency operational centres and related actors. 

 Although the detection infrastructure and warnings are shared between countries, standard operating procedures \(SOPs\) for processing and issuing warnings vary greatly at the national and subnational levels. This is due to the wide variation of technical capacities, legal frameworks, and socio\-cultural factors across the 28 states that surround the Indian Ocean.   The SOPs outline the tasks to be conducted as part of the routine operation of the system, define the roles of different stakeholders at different times and facilitate decision\-making. 

 Haigh and Amaratunga have been working with the UN agency responsible for the IOTWMS since 2010, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO’s \(IOC\-UNESCO\) Intergovernmental Coordination Group \(ICG\-IOTWMS\) – in short IOTWMS. Since 2014, Haigh and Amaratunga worked with a University of Huddersfield team of post\-docs \(including Dias\) and doctoral researchers, and led a series of research projects to study the interface arrangements of tsunami early warning and ways to improve SOPs. The projects were run in conjunction with external partners, including IOTWMS, who facilitated access to related government agencies and end users for data collection and dissemination of findings. It also included academic partners in several Indian Ocean countries, who contributed to empirical data collection and analysis \(University of Colombo, Sri Lanka; Institute of Technology Bandung, Indonesia; Maldives National University, Maldives; University of Yangon, Myanmar\). 

 IOTWMS invited us to undertake research to define the interface concept and identify key areas of capacity in the interface arrangements for tsunami early warning, which Haigh and Amaratunga led as principal investigators on research grants G1 and G2. This involved using the conceptual analysis method to review the literature and develop a conceptual framework of nine core concepts in tsunami early warning \[3.1\].  This formed the basis for Haigh and Amaratunga to lead a detailed empirical study of the interface arrangements in the Sri Lankan tsunami early warning system, including a documentary analysis of international and national guidelines and reports from previous simulation exercises and tabletop exercises, followed by key informant interviews with representatives from eight Sri Lankan government agencies. Thematic analysis was used to provide a detailed understanding of capacities in Sri Lanka that determine the effectiveness of the interface arrangements for tsunami early warning. These findings were validated in focus group discussions with Sri Lankan government representatives and international experts in tsunami early warning systems identified through IOTWMS. This resulted in a detailed analytical framework of eleven critical areas of capacity for the interface arrangements of tsunami early warning that could be tested in other countries \[3.2\], including decision making, defining of actors, the level of centralisation, standardisation, technical and human capacities, spatial and socio\-cultural factors, vertical and horizontal coordination, formal and information communication, and evaluation. It also resulted in a series of recommendations and follow up studies to improve the Sri Lankan interface arrangements for early warning, including a synergised SOP to better define responsibilities and improve coordination \[3.5\]. 

 The analytical framework developed in Sri Lanka provided the basis for Haigh and Amaratunga to lead further detailed empirical studies of IOTWMS members states: Indonesia \[G3\], and Maldives and Myanmar \[G2\]. Haigh and Amaratunga led the research team and developed the overarching research strategy. They worked with in\-country research partners who collected and analysed the empirical data, including documentary analysis and key informant interviews. The cross\-case analysis was carried out by Haigh and Amaratunga using individual country reports. These findings are recorded in a series of research papers, including the interface arrangements in Indonesia \[3.3\], a comparative analysis of tsunami early warning governance arrangements at the interface in Indonesia and Sri Lanka \[3.4\], and a comparative analysis of tsunami early warning interface arrangements in Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar and Sri Lanka \[3.6\]. The analyses identify the current status of the four countries against eleven areas of capacity in the analytical framework, as well as shortcomings in the end\-to\-end warning chain and SOPs. 

 The excellence of the underpinning research has been recognised by Haigh and Amaratunga winning the Newton Prize for Indonesia in 2019, along with Harkunti Rahayu, their Indonesian counterpart, for the ‘best research / innovation that promotes economic development and social welfare’ \(see section B4\), awarded by the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), Newton Fund and Global Challenges Research Fund \(GCRF\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has resulted in <ins>significant changes</ins> to policy decisions on how tsunami preparedness is assessed, regional policy for capacity building, and improved national processes and practices for tsunami early warning that are protecting coastal communities at risk. The <ins>extensive reach</ins> of the impact extends to 28 Indian Ocean countries and the wide range of agencies responsible for tsunami early warning at the regional, national and local levels, including the international body responsible for the IOTWMS, national and local government agencies for disaster management, meteorology and emergency services, and the media. 

 **Changes to regional policy decisions on how tsunami preparedness is assessed by ICG\-IOTWMS as an international agency** 

 In September 2017, Haigh and Amaratunga were formally appointed as expert members of the IOTWMS working group that is responsible for assisting, developing and strengthening the overall capacity and capability of member states in tsunami risk assessment and mitigation, community awareness and preparedness \[5.1\]. 

 During a series of IOTWMS meetings held in Hyderabad, India in July 2018 \[5.1\] and Jakarta, Indonesia in September 2019, presentation of the detailed cross\-country comparisons in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Myanmar \[3.4, 3.6\] resulted in interface arrangements being formally recognised by the IOTWMS, and assessed in the national reports of the 28 member states each year. Dr Srinivasa Kumar Tummala, Head of Secretariat, IOC UNESCO ICG/IOTWMS \[5.3\], summarised the contribution of this work: *“This work led to the identification of critical areas for improvement by member states, as well as comparisons across countries with different risk profiles, demographics and legal frameworks”*. 

 The work is now being embedded in regional guidelines that are being issued by the IOTWMS. Dr Srinivasa Kumar Tummala \[5.3\] confirmed: *“The research on the upstream\-downstream interface arrangements is being embedded in an Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Technical Series guide on Governance of the upstream\-downstream interface in tsunami early warning, which includes the results of the cross\-country analyses and a self\-assessment tool that can be used by countries to continuously evaluate their capacities, for distribution across 28 member states. The guide is being developed through Working Group 1 Tsunami Risk, Community Awareness and Preparedness”.* 

 **Changes to regional policy on capacity development of national agencies in 28 Indian Ocean countries linked to the UNESCO ICG/IOTWMS** 

 Haigh and Amaratunga were asked to guide implementation of a survey for capacity assessment of tsunami preparedness in the Indian Ocean region, informed by the analytical framework described in section 2 \[3.2\]. They developed the capacity survey tool that in November 2018 was issued, by the IOTWMS, to the officially mandated national tsunami contact points of all 28 Indian Ocean member states.  Haigh and Amaratunga also led the survey analysis, which was formally published as an IOTWMS Status Report on Capacity Assessment of Tsunami Preparedness in the Indian Ocean 2019 \[5.2\]. 

 Dr Srinivasa Kumar Tummala \[affiliation listed previously\], highlighted the significant contribution of this work \[5.3\]: *“The 2018 assessment identified capacity gaps and future support requirements in the broad areas of a\) policies, plans and guidelines; b\) risk assessment and reduction; c\) detection, warning and dissemination; and d\) awareness preparedness and response. The results of this survey and their research on capacity areas for tsunami preparedness is informing the ICG/IOTWMS capacity building and training programme that targets the twenty\-eight member states of IOTWMS”*. 

 The reach of the research impact has thereby extended to informing regional policy for capacity building of the officially mandated disaster management and meteorology agencies that are responsible for tsunami early warning in Australia, Bangladesh, British Indian, Ocean Territory, Comoros, Djibouti, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Seychelles, Singapore, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor\-Leste, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. 

 **Improved national processes and practices for tsunami early warning in Indonesia and Sri Lanka** 

 The research recommendations that emerged from the studies in Sri Lanka and Indonesia \[3.2, 3.3, 3.5\] have resulted in changes and improvements to their national processes and practices for tsunami early warning. This includes improvements to SOPs that identify and coordinate the responsibilities and actions of different agencies involved in early warning at the national level, as well as training and evaluation to support their implementation. 

 In her support for the research receiving the 2019 Newton Prize for Indonesia, Professor 

 Dwikorita Karnawati, Chair of IOTWMS and Director General of the Indonesian National Agency of Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, confirmed that \[5.4\], *""The research has helped us to carry out a comprehensive assessment of tsunami preparedness in Indonesia and other countries in the Indian Ocean, allowing us to improve our standard operating procedures""*. The research is therefore helping to protect many of the 800 million people, who the UNESCO\-IOC Indian Ocean Tsunami Information Centre estimate to live in coastal areas surrounding the Indian Ocean. 

 As a result of the Sri Lanka interface study \[3.2, 3.5\], a newly updated and documented cross agency and synergised SOP \[5.5\] for the Sri Lankan tsunami early warning system was developed and formally adopted in Sri Lanka, and tested at a periodic, region wide exercise for evaluating the readiness, and where Haigh and Amaratunga were appointed by IOTWMS as official international observers \(IOWave in October 2018 and October 2020\) \[5.6\], as well as at a tabletop simulation exercise in 2019 \[5.7\]. 

 The impacts of the research and changes to SOPs are confirmed by Mr Sunil Jayaweera, Director of Preparedness Planning at the national disaster management agency in Sri Lanka \[5.8\]: *“Their research has helped us to identify and address limitations in our tsunami early warning system, including unclear communication protocols and inadequate organisational coordination. This has resulted in changes to the SOPs to help workers carry out complex routine operations involved in receiving regional dissemination and warning information, evaluating against pre\-defined criteria, and disseminating and enacting the response through other agencies”*. 

 The impact of the work is further confirmed by Dr Sarath Premalal, Director General, Department of Meteorology, Sri Lanka \[5.9\]: *“This revised SOP has achieved improved efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance in Sri Lanka, while reducing miscommunication and failure to comply with country regulations”*. 

 Mr Sunil Jayaweera \[affiliation listed previously\], summarised the impact of our work in Sri Lanka \[5.8\]: *“In doing so, their research is helping us to protect from tsunami the approximate 5.1 million or 25% of the Sri Lankan population that lives within 1 km of the coastline”.* 

 The reach of the research has also extended to the District \(local\) level in Sri Lanka, in terms of improved vertical and horizontal coordination of early warning agencies. Mr K. Sugunathas, Assistant Director of the Trincomalee District Disaster Management Unit confirmed that the revised SOPs and processes, and improved training provision from the Disaster Management Center in Sri Lanka, resulting from the work have \[5.10\], *“increased our coordination with other agencies, including the tri\-forces, local disaster management officials and the private sector.”* He added: *“The IOWAVE and tabletop simulation exercises have demonstrated the benefits of the new synergised SOP. Our officers now better understand tsunami alerts and related messages, and can relay more accurate warning information to our local people in a timelier manner. This will help us to better protect our local communities in case of a future tsunami”.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the University of Hull has defined the condition of chronic cough as a disease and had the following impact: the work has driven best practice culminating in the full publication of European Respiratory Society guidelines in 2020, the first truly international guidelines as endorsed by the Chinese and Asian Societies; the work has been crucial in driving significant investment in this, until recently, neglected disease, as evidenced by the purchase of Afferent by Merck for >$1 billion to become the market leader in chronic cough treatment. Five lead compounds in international phase 2 and phase 3 trials which all completed recruitment in 2020 are founded on Hull’s research. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research in Hull, led by Professor Alyn Morice since 1999, has established the patterns of presentation and molecular mechanisms that underlie chronic cough \( **2.1**\); developed methodologies for the disease’s objective quantification nationally and internationally \( **2.2**\); and has undertaken seminal work which has led to the development of a new class of antitussive drugs \( **2.3**\). The Hull team has worked together with key national \(Prof S Birring, Kings College London, Prof L McGarvey, Queens University Belfast\) and international collaborators \(Prof P Dicpinigaitis, Einstein University, New York, USA\) over the past two decades publishing extensively. The key research findings are: 

 **2.1 Epidemiology and disease classification** 

 We have shown that chronic cough is a condition that affects approximately 10% of the UK population; with half reporting that cough interferes with daily life **\(1\)**, a finding subsequently confirmed by a systematic review of 80 studies worldwide **\(2\)**. Currently, confusion in how to diagnose chronic cough leads to over\-prescription of antibiotics, and the prescription of ineffective, inhaled, medication. We published a survey of such patients showing that they attended an average of six doctors, over a mean time period of 6 years, with multiple, costly, investigations; but always without any relief from their symptoms **\(3\)**. In 2011 we published the Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire \(HARQ\) demonstrating that this could accurately diagnose the condition **\(4\)**. Over the REF period its usage has become global. 

 **2.2 Adoption of best practice** 

 A major clinical trial published in 2011 by the Hull team demonstrated that reflux cough did not respond to high\-dose acid suppression, the previous standard treatment **\(5\).** This, together with confirmatory work from others, has led to a radical change in the recommendations in the recently published European Respiratory Society \(ERS\) guidelines. Prof Morice has chaired the four Task Forces, funded by the ERS, on the diagnosis, treatment and assessment of cough \(last one held in 2019\) involving investigators from the USA, China, Korea, as well as across Europe which has allowed an international consensus to be established. 

 **2.3 Drug development** 

 Hull’s research work on the mechanism of cough hypersensitivity has been vital for assessing the clinical importance of putative antitussive agents by both the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory bodies. Hull has been one of the main centres conducting Phase 2 and 3 trials on the first\-in\-class drug, gefapixant \(AF\-219/MK\-7264\), on behalf of Afferent Pharmaceuticals. The drug is an antagonist of the P2X3 purinergic receptor, which has demonstrated a role for adenosine triphosphate \(ATP\) in afferent neural pathways of airway hypersensitivity. The emerging evidence of gefapixant’s efficacy against chronic cough is high, with approximately two thirds of patients with chronic refractory cough responding. At the request of the US Federal Drug Administration Prof Morice’s unit performed a study, published in 2020, demonstrating efficacy with subjective and objective endpoints. The primary endpoint of this study was a unique four modality challenge: ATP, distilled water, capsaicin and citric acid. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that two pathways exist in the human cough reflex; one irritant, nociceptor led, and one purinergic/osmotic, which is responsible for pathological cough **\(6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The major impact of our research has been to characterise chronic cough as a disease distinct from asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \(COPD\) and to develop methodology to study it; subsequently, this has allowed drug development in a new therapeutic area. Hence, pharmaceutical companies have novel products in which to invest, and most importantly are able to bring relief to previously undiagnosed and untreatable patients. 

 **2.1 & 2.2 Disease classification and Patient benefit** 

 The simple diagnostic questionnaire, Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire \(HARQ\), which the Hull team developed is now validated in 39 different countries and is available in 20 different languages. It is freely available online on ISSC.info; **8,546** UK patients accessed and completed the questionnaire in a single year **\(Evidence 1\)**. In 2020, the use of these online resources was endorsed in the new International Guidelines **\(Evidence 2\).** The relief afforded to patients, who are able at last to understand their symptoms as cough hypersensitivity is difficult to understate **\(Evidence 3\)**. 

 Patients who were previously dismissed as neurotic because no clear label could be attached, can now be told they have cough hypersensitivity, a disorder of the vagal afferent nerves. Such patients have usually undergone multiple investigation such as endoscopy, CT scan and challenge testing only to be told there is nothing wrong. Inappropriate treatment in the form of anti\-asthma, antibiotic, or anti\-acid therapy is prescribed, frequently on a long term basis. One patient’s account is detailed as an example of the huge impact the Hull team’s work has had: “ *I have suffered from all the symptoms you describe in your article, to a chronic degree for the last 7 or more years. I have seen so many consultants and specialists they are too numerous to mention. I have undergone all the tests relating to this problem several times over and have taken all the prescribed medications for reflux to no avail and I am still no nearer any sort of a fix. I am depressed and anxious \(medicated\) due to the worry of the condition of my lungs, airway and throat and the possibility of long term damage or even cancer. ... Your article is the first time in those 7 years that I have seen a diagnosis that entirely matches my symptoms\! I am elated ...”* **\(Evidence 4\).** 

 The international guidelines provide guidance to clinicians, impact positively on the patient pathway, decrease the chances of costly risks associated with cough management, i.e. CT scan induced breast cancer, and provide effective advice on often unconsidered therapeutic options **\(Evidence 2\).** 

 **2.3 Developing new drugs for chronic cough** 

 Hull’s work, defining at least two different pathways for the pathophysiology of chronic cough, explained why several costly clinical studies blocking the irritant receptors failed in the clinic, as a result of these findings drug development by GSK has now been abandoned. The Clinical Development Director of GlaxoSmithKline stated, *“This study investigated the efficacy and safety of GSK2798745 \(a TRPV4 inhibitor\) in patients with chronic cough. The results of this study allowed a clear decision to be made regarding termination of development of this compound in this indication. The impact of this work was that there was a cost saving to the project with spending until study completion not required. Because of the specific design of the study, the work also prevented unnecessary recruitment of patients to a study with an ineffective drug.”* \( **Evidence 5**\). 

 Conversely, Hull’s research has led to the substantial investment in the development of a series of effective, novel, therapeutics by various other pharmaceutical companies. Afferent Pharmaceuticals were the first to develop an effective agent blocking vagal afferent hypersensitivity; Gefapixant \(AF219/MK7264\) was trialled in several phase 2 studies where Prof Morice advised on the study design and conduct. As a result of further studies on Gefapixant, Afferent Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Merck, a major global pharmaceutical company. The commercial decision was attributed in part due to Hull’s research data \( **Evidence 6**\). The deal involved an immediate payment of $500 million, with a further $750 million payable when the drug was licensed by the US Federal Drugs Agency \(application in progress\). Prof Morice has continued to work with Merck and indeed was responsible for providing the advice as to the primary endpoint of their pivotal, phase 3, clinical studies \(Cough 1 and Cough 2; presented at the ERS Congress September 2020\). The Clinical Director of Merck wrote, *“Alyn \(Prof Morice\) has done a wonderful job of helping educate the overall Merck team on the field of chronic cough and he has provided valuable input on the chronic cough clinical program with regards to appropriate endpoint selection, rigorous patient selection, and expert opinion support during the course of the trial.”* **\(Evidence 7\).** 

 Finally, first data from Merck’s phase III studies of Gefapixant \(Cough 1 and Cough 2\), studying over 2000 patients with objectively proven chronic cough, clearly showed the effectiveness of using HARQ as a diagnostic tool. The HARQ score at baseline for these patients was 40/70, whereas the upper limit of normal people is 14; demonstrating for the first\-time HARQ’s global utility **\(Evidence 8\)**. 

 In anticipation of a UK licencing application for these new drugs the Hull team have been advising the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) as to the correct metrics to use in their assessment of antitussive drugs. Commonly used scores such as Short\-form \(SF\) 35 which measure quality of life \(QOL\) are inappropriate since patients with chronic cough are rarely physically disabled even if their lives are ruined. 

 Three other compounds of this new class of drug, exploiting Hull’s research that defined a mechanistic pathway, are currently in phase 2 trials. Bayer, Shionogi, and Bellus Health, have all made multi\-million investments in these clinical trials; and Prof Morice is supporting the companies by advising as chief or principal investigator, e.g. *“The unique combination of scientific & clinical expertise of Prof. Alyn together with this ability to optimally run and steer clinical studies has informed our research and development programs and allowed us to progress our P2X3 projects to successful demonstrating efficacy in patients with refractory chronic cough\(RCC\)”* \( **Evidence 9**\). Preliminary trial results show treatment success in over two thirds of patients and therefore it is highly likely that the first effective drugs for chronic cough in over 40 years will soon be available \( **Evidence 10**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 “Mastery” teaching in mathematics is a UK government initiative with the ambition to eradicate under\-achievement. University of Bristol research has shaped the UK’s National Centre for Excellence in Teaching Mathematics \(NCETM\) Professional Development materials and resources for primary schools which have become the definitive interpretation of mastery teaching in England. The materials are backed by the Department for Education \(DfE\) and heavily influenced the new DfE/NCETM Primary Mathematics National Curriculum guidance. The materials are in use by a network of 40 Maths Hubs and 8,000 primary schools in England, with preliminary evidence of improvement in student understanding and attainment. The approach also informed primary schools maths textbooks in Mexico used by 4.5 million children. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Under\-achievement of students in mathematics is a fundamental problem in the UK. In England, a stubborn 20% of each cohort, by age 15, attain levels of numeracy judged internationally not to be suitable for life in a modern society \(Level 1 or below on PISA tests\). We know that social mobility is linked directly to attainment in mathematics, with the subject acting as gatekeeper for access to Higher Education and professional qualification. Coles’ research, in collaboration with Sinclair \(Simon Fraser University Vancouver\), has showed that one reason for this under\-achievement is that mathematical concepts can be presented to students in incoherent ways or in ways that do not match well with children’s lived experiences. Their research calls into question prevalent assumptions about curriculum organisation and teaching approaches, both within the academic community and current school practices. There are three strands to their research findings and conceptual arguments: 

#  What is a number? 

 Children’s first engagements with number in the early years of primary school tend to be in contexts of answering “how many?” questions. Yet outside school, it is clear that meaningful experiences include, for example, engaging in number as an ordered sequence \(e.g. reciting “one\-two\-three…”, etc\) in which quantity is less important than how one number relates to its neighbours. Coles and Sinclair have conducted empirical studies which indicate that ways in which children operate with numbers are often beyond curriculum expectations, raising concerns that the expectation of linear progression can lead to lack of exposure to more sophisticated techniques \[2\]. Their research makes the case for offering children a balance of exposure to number as a relation or measure, and number as linked to objects or quantity \[5, 6\]. 

#  The role of place value 

 A significant barrier to children’s progress in mathematics occurs if they cannot interpret the written form of two\-digit numbers \(e.g. 23\) to indicate two tens and three units. Typically work on place value makes use of materials that emphasises number as object and quantity. Empirical work carried out by Coles and Sinclair has highlighted alternative and powerful routes to becoming successful with place value conventions that draw on children’s facility with language and gesture – building on how numbers relate to one another in a naming structure, more than how numbers relate to objects. For instance, they have demonstrated the benefits of working with a “dual naming” of the numbers 11\-99, that makes the place value component of these numbers linguistically explicit \(e.g., “23” has the dual names of “twenty\-three” and “two\-ty three”\) \[4, 6\]. Their research has helped to de\-mystify what is involved in understanding place value, for instance, that the “place” of a number indicates its value only in a number’s written form, whereas in spoken language, it is labels \(such as “hundred”\) that indicate value \(and e.g., phrases such as “four and twenty” are meaningful, where the standard place is swapped\). 

#  Developmental assumptions 

 Coles and Sinclair have brought into question assumptions, prevalent across many countries, that learning in mathematics must proceed from operations on concrete objects, into work with abstract and dis\-embodied concepts \[3\]. Their critique suggests, for example, that there is no basis for current practices of excluding some students from “abstract” mathematics on the basis that they are not ready for it. They show how choices of tool use and ways of working can disrupt typical orders in which students learn particular concepts \[2\] such that, for instance, student facility with what is usually taken to be ‘concrete’ and ‘abstract’ might take place simultaneously. Their research demonstrates how uses of particular representations and digital tools prompts students’ creative use of number concepts and their mathematical reasoning \[1\]. They have shown how children, across a range of levels of prior attainment, can be supported to reason about and discuss mathematical ideas that would usually be seen as beyond them \[6\] *if* the mathematics is offered and represented in a structured and coherent manner \[1\]. Their research proposes a novel conception of how children come to be successful at mathematics, avoiding past dualist separations of thought and action.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Coles’ research has directly informed education policy in England. This has led to improvements in mathematical teaching practices in English primary schools, which in turn is having a positive impact on student outcomes. 

#  Informing education policy in England 

 Coles’ research shaped the development of the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics \(NCETM\) Primary Mastery Professional Development \(PD\) materials \[A, B\], which “ *are supported by the Department for Education and will be disseminated via the 35 Maths Hub across England”* \[B\]. These resources then *‘heavily influenced’* the new NCETM and Department for Education \(DfE\) Primary Mathematics National Curriculum Guidance Document \(2020\) \[I, J\], as set out below. The research has made a distinct and material contribution to the content of the professional development materials and curriculum guidance in three ways: 

 *A broader conception of number:* following directly from Coles and Sinclair’s arguments \[1, 2 & 5\], there is an explicit balance between different concepts of number in the materials. In particular, the PD materials \[A\] are explicit that teachers should be offering students experiences of “number as object” \(a concept\) at the same time as experiences of “number as length” \(a more relational concept\) \[2, 5\]. For instance, the very first teaching point of the Addition and Subtraction “spine” addresses number as a measure, *before* introducing number as linked to objects \(e.g. see “Spine 1 overview” in \[A\]; National Curriculum Guidance \[I\], pp.20\-23, work on numbers 1\-20 as location and length, before object\), a reversal of the historically typical order. 

 *Downplaying place value:* whereas the National Curriculum has a separate strand for “Place Value” within learning number in primary school, in the NCETM PD materials there is no separate “place value” strand \[4\] \(the three current “spines” \[A\] subsume all National Curriculum targets for place value\). Work on place value is embedded within strands of other number work, serving to downplay its importance, as called for by Coles and Sinclair \[4\]. Their proposals for a “dual naming” of numbers 11\-99 \[6\] has been written into the materials and guidance now going to all primary schools \(Spine 1, Section 1.9 \[A\]\). In line with their recommendations, the order of the NCETM materials \(Spine 1, Section 1.9 and 1.10\) mean that children will now work on the numbers 20\-100, which are mainly named regularly \(e.g. “43” is said “four”/”ty”/”three”; “95” is said “nine”/”ty”/”five”\) before coming back to work on the irregularly named numbers from 10\-19 \(also see National Curriculum Guidance \[I\], pp.18\-19\). 

 *Use of resources and representations:* one of the resources proposed by Coles and Sinclair is the “Gattegno Tens Chart”, as a device for allowing both a linguistic approach to place value and a device that allows teachers and students to work directly on ‘abstract’ elements of number structure \[1, 6\]. In the NCETM materials there is significant use of the “Gattegno Tens Chart” in the materials \[1, 6\], \(e.g. see Spine 1, Section 1.8, Teaching point 3, from \[A\]; and National Curriculum Guidance \[I\], p.19\). The chart is also explicitly mentioned as one of the core representations of number that should be used consistently throughout the primary years and extending into the first years of secondary school. 

#  Improved maths pedagogy of primary teachers in England 

 All the NCETM materials are freely available on their website, with approximately 24,000 downloads per month \(comprising approximately 100,000 individual files\) \[Hi\], and over 8,000 primary schools engaged with the mastery programme \[J\]. Coles has run professional development activities supporting teachers to understand the basis of the new approaches to learning mathematics, for example keynote talks at conferences and conference sessions \(Jurassic Maths Hub conference, June 2020; Cabot Learning Federation Mathematics Meeting, March 2018; South West Primary Maths Conference, November 2017; Boolean Hub Conference, January 2017\) \[F\]. The NCETM materials are not statutory and the level of take\-up by schools \(over half of all primary schools\) \[J\], is evidence of their relevance to teachers. 

 There is evidence of primary teachers making use of the materials, including some who were sceptical of their value but are *“now their biggest fans”* and can see *“how confident the Year 1s were in their maths talking and reasoning”* \[Ci, Cii\]. In a recent evaluation involving 5 schools the impact “… *on teachers was felt particularly on their subject knowledge, confidence, and the precision of their teaching. In these schools there was evidence that students are behaving in ways that have not been seen before, in terms of their enjoyment of mathematics, their confidence in the subject, … and in terms of their ability to use reasoning and mathematical language*.” \[Ci\]. An ESRC Impact Acceleration Award \[i\] led to a report by Coles on one ‘early adopter’ school’s experiences with the materials. Positive impacts were found on teachers in the school and there was evidence of changes in teaching practice, linked to a professional cycle using the materials, trialled through the ESRC IAA project \[i\]. This evaluation evidence was also reported in the NCETM Newsletter \[D \(p.9\-16\)\] and sent to all primary schools in England. 

 The NCETM now has 40 Maths Hubs \[Hiii\] and in each one there is a group of teachers from six or seven different schools working on primary mastery in “Teaching for Mastery Work Groups”, including the use and implementation of the materials \(overall, therefore, involving teachers in approximately 240 schools\) \[Hii\]. Testimony of teachers running these groups \[Hii, J\] points to impact on teacher knowledge, teaching practice and resulting increase of confidence of students in mathematics. The Director of the NCETM observed: *““Feedback from teachers about the materials has been overwhelmingly positive, suggesting that the materials have helped to improve teachers’ mathematical subject knowledge, as well as improving their pedagogical subject knowledge and supporting them to developing their pedagogical skills*.” \[J\]. These impacts are corroborated by a report from the NCETM, conducted independently, which summarised interviews with mathematics leads in five primary schools \[Ci\]. Themes in this report include changes in teachers’ understanding of the power of representations to become tools for children’s thinking, rather than supports for algorithmic procedures: “ *We have always used the base 10 resources alongside a pictorial representation but in previous years that felt more like the method rather than the concept. Now it feels like \[the representation\] is there to support but lots of them are doing it mentally. I am not saying the ‘win’ is doing it mentally but being able to step back from it”* \[Ci\]. The teachers across the schools spoke about the PD materials changing their approach to teaching mathematics and their own understanding of number: *“Teacher subject knowledge has definitely improved, especially for teachers who are early in their career. I think they have got a much better understanding of the structure of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division; I think that is the biggest thing, that they are understanding”* \[Ci\]. 

 Further national impact comes through Coles’ work with the professional body the Association of Teachers of Mathematics, for whose magazine he writes regularly \[E\] and for whom he has run research presentations, at local and national conferences, both prior to and since 2014 \(e.g. February 2015, Birmingham ATM branch \[60 teachers\]; March 2011, ATM plenary speaker \[450 attendees\]\), influencing mathematics teachers and their approaches. 

#  Increased pupil mastery in mathematics 

 Emerging evidence reveals the direct benefits to the students whose experience of learning mathematics is conceptually coherent, supporting attainment and opportunities for mathematical reasoning \[C, H\]. Teachers in the NCETM report \[Ci\] spoke about never before having seen students understand and reason about mathematics in the way that they did when the PD materials were used as the basis for lesson planning: 

 *“I have taught the same things for the past five years and this is the only year I can actually say they have really understood fractions thanks to the division and multiplication that went before it”* 

 *”...you realise that if you give them the language structure then they can reason, if you don’t what hope have they got, but the materials offer that structure, and you have all these visuals that you can compare and talk about”* 

 *“...blown away by how \[students\] were able to discuss mathematics at the end of year 1 in a way \[we\] had not seen a year 1 class do before”.* 

#  Informing international education policy and practice 

 The overall approach to teaching and learning mathematics has also influenced the development of textbooks in Mexico and in particular the Teacher Guides which, along with the national textbooks, are mandated by the Mexican government for use in all schools, thereby shaping mathematics teaching and learning strategies that reach 4.5 million primary school children \[G\].  The textbook author noted Coles’ work *“on the development of classroom cultures and on learning mathematics \(and early number\) led to advice to teachers to promote cultures in which students explore mathematical structure and where making mistakes is part of doing \(and therefore learning\) mathematics\)”* \[G\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Grounded in Liverpool’s dynamical systems research, a pioneering five\-year collaboration between Liverpool mathematicians and British composer Emily Howard has generated impacts on creativity, culture and society. Beneficiaries include Howard herself, as well as other composers, audiences \(live, radio, streaming\), concert venues, publishers, record labels and performing ensembles: 

 Seven musical works include commissions for BBC Proms and Sir Simon Rattle, live performances at the Royal Albert Hall and the Barbican Centre, as well as five broadcasts on BBC Radio 3. 

 Concerto for Orchestra hailed by *The Times* as ‘ *visionary*’ and recognised with a British Composer Award \(2017\). 

 Four published scores, plus two tracks released by record label NMC Recordings. 

 Lasting influence on artistic practice through a first\-of\-its\-kind centre for science and music \(PRiSM\).

##  2. Underpinning research 

 Lasse Rempe is Professor of Pure Mathematics in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Liverpool. Rempe researches **dynamical systems**, specifically the iteration of transcendental functions. In **\[3.1\]**, with Sebastian van Strien \(Imperial College London\) he established density of hyperbolicity for the famous Arnold family of circle maps. This family is a simple model for phase\-locking in a periodically forced oscillator that has been studied intensively since the 1960s. Density of hyperbolicity is a central question in one\-dimensional dynamics \(compare Smale’s 11th “problem for the next century”\). It states, informally, that through a small perturbation within the given family, any system can be changed into one exhibiting the simplest type of behaviour \(convergence to stable cycles\) – no matter how chaotically the original system behaves. The proof of this result for the Arnold family draws significantly on Rempe's earlier work **\[3.2\]** on the escaping set of transcendental entire functions; that is, the set of points where the iterates converge to infinity. In **\[3.2\]**, Rempe showed that, for a certain class of functions, the behaviour on this set is very rigid \- that is, it does not give rise to non\-trivial perturbations. The same holds for the complex extension of the Arnold family, with the same proof, and this fact plays a crucial role in **\[3.1\]**. This body of research was supported by funding from EPSRC \(EP/E017886/1, EP/E052851/1\) and the Leverhulme Trust \(Philip Leverhulme Prize 2012\), totalling GBP529,847. 

 There are four key reasons why Rempe’s proof in **\[3.1\]** provided fertile ground for developing new creative thinking in his collaboration with composer Emily Howard. Firstly, the result lends itself to expression in simple and general terms \(no matter how chaotic such a system, there is always stability nearby\). Secondly, phase\-locking is a phenomenon relevant to musicians – from the synchronisation of linked metronomes to the elimination of non\-harmonic overtones through the bowing of a violin string. Thirdly, structure in the complex plane – invisible in the formulation of the problem – plays a crucial part in the proof, which is philosophically intriguing. And, finally, the systems in question could be used to design data series as input into and inspiration for the creative process. From these discussions, Howard evolved new artistic practice underpinned by latest results in dynamical systems research. As an evolution of this creative practice, she went on to draw inspiration directly from other areas of excellent research within Liverpool’s Department of Mathematical Sciences. A further example is given below. 

 Anna Pratoussevitch is a Reader in Pure Mathematics, researching **geometry and topology**. To explore pseudo\-Riemannian space forms of constant curvature, Pratoussevitch constructs fundamental domains in the shape of higher\-dimensional polyhedra **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. A central question of low\-dimensional topology has been the classification of 3\-dimensional manifolds. Thurston's approach to this problem, that any 3\-manifold can be constructed from building blocks carrying one of 8 Riemannian geometries, has contributed significantly to our understanding of low\-dimensional manifolds, including the celebrated proof of the Poincaré conjecture by Perelman. Pratoussevitch's work explores the implications of this approach in pseudo\-Riemannian 3\-manifolds by describing how pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature can be constructed from pseudo\-Riemannian polyhedra by gluing together pairs of 2\-dimensional faces. The constructions of building block manifolds from polyhedra in both Riemannian and pseudo\-Riemannian geometry give excellent visual representations of 3\-dimensional objects that cannot be easily visualized in 3D space. Pratoussevitch explored these fundamental ideas of positive and negative curvature in different spaces alongside images of the polyhedra with composer Howard, initiating new creative thinking about shapes and space to inspire new orchestral music.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 This body of pure mathematics research has brought about three principal impacts on creativity, culture and society: 

-  **4.1.** New creative thinking that transformed the practice and career of composer Emily Howard **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

-  **4.2.** Seven musical works over five years, with diverse coverage to wide critical acclaim **\[5.1, 5.3\-8\]**. 

-  **4.3.** Dedicated centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music \(PRiSM\) in Manchester that is influencing composer practice nationally **\[5.1, 5.8\-10\]**. 

###  4.1. Dynamical systems research transforms practice of composer 

 Rempe and Liverpool’s Department of Mathematical Sciences hosted freelance composer Emily Howard as Leverhulme Trust Artist in Residence between February and November 2015 **\[5.2\]**. A mathematics graduate herself, Howard’s fluency in mathematical language enabled her not only to absorb general ideas, but also to discuss details and subtleties of contemporary mathematical research. According to Howard, this made for an ‘ *appealing and distinctive*’ partnership **\[5.1\]**. 

 Working with Rempe and Pratoussevitch provided Howard with unique insights into frontier mathematical research, taking her creative ideas beyond classical mathematical principles for the first time **\[5.1\]**. Howard joined Rempe and his group in discussions about their research throughout 2015, with particular focus on Rempe’s work on the Arnold family **\[3.1\]**. The group created two sets of numeric data for Howard, encapsulating key ideas in the result and its proof. These datasets and discussions were pivotal creative input for Howard’s 2015 compositions described below, establishing enduring principles for her entire approach to composition **\[5.1\]**. Howard explains how this opportunity **‘ **transformed my creative practice at the time and has continued to influence my entire creative approach and musical works since’* **\[5.1\]**. 

###  4.2. Audiences, listeners, music venues, publishers, record labels and performing ensembles benefit from new critically\-acclaimed music 

 The body of research **\[3.1\-4\]** influenced seven critically acclaimed musical works of increasing profile **\[5.3\-4\]**. Audiences in the UK, Germany, Canada and the US, BBC audiences and the wider public have benefitted from sold\-out live performances, radio and streaming **\[5.3\-4\]**. Edition Peters, a world\-leading publisher of classical sheet music who only publishes music with ‘ *sufficient commercial benefit*’ **\[5.5a\]**, signed Howard in March 2019 **\[5.5b\]**. Accompanying programme notes detail how the music is a response to Liverpool’s research **\[5.5c\]**. 

 *Torus* \(2016\) is the first of three geometry\-inspired orchestral works drawing on Howard’s engagement with mathematics research. *Torus* was a **BBC Proms** co\-commission with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, first performed in 2016 at the iconic **Royal Albert Hall** **\[5.3a\]** to a sell\-out audience of 4,294 **\[5.3b\]**. Hailed by **The Guardian** as *‘one of this year’s finest new works’* **\[5.6a\]** and ‘ *visionary*’ by **The Times** **\[5.6b\]**, the piece was recognised with a 2017 **British Composer Award* **\[5.6c\]**, the highest industry recognition for excellence in classical composition. *Torus* was described by the judges as ‘ *captivating from start to finish*’ **\[5.6c\]**. 

 The **Barbican Centre, London**, Europe’s largest performing arts centre, where a live performance of *Torus* by the BBC Symphony Orchestra took place in 2019, describe the piece as ‘ *startling*’ **\[5.3c, 5.8\]**. *Torus* has featured twice on BBC Radio 3 **\[5.3d,e\]**, most recently in 2019 to approximately 333,000 listeners **\[5.3f\]**. Howard deliberately included in *Torus* a ‘ *crucial “perturbation”: a moment where, as in your* \[Rempe’s\] *work, the parameters of the system change slightly to dramatic effect’* **\[5.1\]**. *sphere* \(2017\) was commissioned by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, Germany and broadcast on **BBC Radio 3** **\[5.3g\]** to approximately 310,000 listeners **\[5.3f\]**. Howard explains how ‘ *Several conceptual ideas from dynamical systems* \[Rempe\] *as well as ideas from topology and geometry* \[Pratoussevitch\] *stemming from conversations with researchers at Liverpool have noticeably influenced the work’* **\[5.2\]**. 

 *Antisphere* was commissioned by the Barbican with internationally renowned conductor **Sir Simon Rattle** to open the **London Symphony Orchestra’s** 2019/20 season **\[5.3h, 5.8\]** to a live audience of 1,419 people **\[5.3i\]**. The Barbican’s Classical Programming Coordinator describes this ‘ *dynamic contribution*’ to the Barbican’s 2019/20 programme \- **‘ **bringing to life** **the close connections between the arts and sciences in a truly engaging way**’** and bringing about ‘ *widespread media coverage in national outlets, including interviews on BBC Radio 4*’ **\[5.8\]**. By this time, Howard was credited by Sir Simon Rattle as a *‘gifted composer’*, with her music always having ‘ *a scientific picture behind it*’ and her ‘ *own very particular sound world*’ **\[5.7\]**. 

 Other pieces influenced directly by Rempe’s research include *Leviathan* \(2015\), creating ‘ *a newly‐formed and unpredictable musical language, which responds to recent mathematical research in dynamical systems’* **\[5.5c\]**. Howard explains why this research was important: ‘ *The contrast of chaos in a…system and the stability of neighbouring systems was of particular interest to me, and the connection to physical systems – in particular phase\-locking – and its relevance to musical instruments*’ **\[5.1\]**. *Leviathan* was performed in 2015 in Montreal, Toronto, Detroit, Chicago and New York **\[5.5c\]** as well as six venues in the UK. 

 Howard’s song *Threnos* \(2015\) was broadcast by **BBC Singers** in November 2019 **\[5.3j\]** to approximately 227,000 radio listeners **\[5.3f\]**. *Threnos* and *Leviathan* were recorded for the **NMC Recordings Label** and commercially released in 2016 on Howard’s NMC Disc *Magnetite* **\[5.4\]**, which received four stars from **The Guardian** \[5.6d\]**. The album liner explains how dynamical systems \(specifically the chaotic motion of a forced oscillator\) directly informed the time structure of the work **\[5.4d\]**. At November 2020 it had been streamed 32,950 times, more than ten times that of an equivalent collection released that year **\[5.4e\]**. 

 *Orbit 1a and Orbit 2a* \(2015\) are a direct response to the datasets provided by Rempe’s group. Howard explains ‘ *I selected different musical properties to represent unstable and stable periodic orbits and depicted the specific moment of perturbation \(where the underlying rules of the systems change\) as a definite event’* **\[5.1\]**. Continuing the Orbits series, *Chaos or Chess* \(2016\) is influenced in a *‘more abstract conceptual way by your* \[Rempe’s\] *proof and our stimulating discussions*’, as for *Threnos* **\[5.1\]**. *Orbit 1a* and *Chaos or Chess* were performed live on **BBC Radio 3** in 2016 **\[5.3k\]** and the latter at the Edinburgh Science Festival in 2019 **\[5.3l\]**. 

###  4.3. New dedicated centre for science and music \(PRiSM\) influences other composers 

 Engaging with Liverpool’s research **\[3.1\-4\]** transformed Howard’s approach to composition, shifting the foundations of her entire creative practice, career and outputs: ‘ *Since we* \[Howard and Rempe\] *pioneered this approach, I actively seek out other mathematicians and scientists as rich sources of creative input, made possible through the mathematical confidence I developed during the Liverpool residency… **Through the vehicle of PRiSM** \[centre for Practice & Research in Science & Music\] **we are influencing other composers to change creative practice at national scale \- bringing together a unique community of practitioners and researchers.** *This propagation is evidence of the success and sustainability of the creative approach we pioneered together in Liverpool*’ **\[5.1\]**. 

 In 2017 Howard co\-established PRiSM at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester, of which Rempe is a founding Associate member **\[5.1, 5.9a\]**. **Marcus du Sautoy** \(Co\-Director of PRiSM and Simonyi Professor, University of Oxford\) asserts Rempe’s ‘ *pioneering collaboration with Emily was instrumental to the inception of PRiSM*’ **\[5.10\]**. 

 PRiSM is building on the approach developed at Liverpool to benefit composers, curators and audiences through high\-profile commissions. Artificial Intelligence \(AI\)\-generated music in association with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra **\[5.9b\]** is one example. This featured on the **Royal Institution Christmas Lectures** **2019* **\[5.9c\]**, broadcast on BBC 4 and available afterwards on BBC iPlayer, attracting 559,813 views \(03\-03\-2020\) **\[5.9d\]**. Another composer explains how a PRiSM collaboration in 2020 changed her practice: ‘ *I had never before used a scientific paper as a starting point for creating music, and now I am looking at using many different types of text to inform my work as an opera composer*’ **\[5.9e\]**. The **Barbican Centre** evaluates a PRiSM event in 2019: a ‘ *ground\-breaking team of composers from PRiSM*… *leading to new insights*’, enabling the venue to *‘reach an audience outside of our usual classical attenders’,* bringing *‘almost double the expected audience numbers*’; it ‘ *worked so well …we are also looking for further opportunities to involve guest curators in our work*’; benefits to performers include ‘ *using new technologies… which they intend to use more in their day\-to\-day work*’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 *‘ **With the world around us changing, I believe the Barbican’s vision of ‘Arts without Boundaries’ is more vital than ever and that Emily Howard and PRiSM’s innovative works are advancing our progress in realising this vision**’* **\[5.8\]** – The Barbican Centre.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 **Scott’**s research impacts upon the representation of popular music from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in nationally and internationally consumed media and other commercial products. More specifically, **Scott’**s research has been instrumental in underpinning the accurate portrayal of the repertoires, creators and cultures of older styles of popular music, particularly those dating from the Victorian era. This is evident in media ranging from computer games, television programmes and radio shows to theatre productions, and print and audio books, strengthening the production values of these outputs and enabling production companies to achieve their aims regarding quality and socio\-cultural authenticity. 

  
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by **Scott** has focused on the historical sociology of principally popular and light musics from the mid\-nineteenth to mid\-twentieth century. His research contextualises such music with regard to its social, historical and geographic significance, arguing not only that it can be viewed in terms of class and nationalism, but also as an important marker of time, place and society more broadly. 

 **Scott** has argued that ‘the first popular music revolution actually occurred in the nineteenth century’. The history and development of the designation ‘popular’ is outlined in the new chapter written for the second edition of *The Singing Bourgeois* as ‘moving from well\-known to well\-received to successful’ **\[1\]** and these distinctions underpin **Scott**’s discussion of music and social class in London during the Victorian era. This is especially the case with respect to the sorts of music heard in different types of venues in the city centre and the suburbs **\[1\]** and how these repertoires changed across the latter part of the nineteenth century. Connections between ideas of the popular and societal expectations of music, musicians and class, as well as matters of taste and identity, are framed by detailed consideration of the ways in which popular music developed across a number of leading international cultural centres alongside London: New York, Paris and Vienna **\[1, 3\]**. By examining the geographical as well as the historical development of popular music, **Scott’**s research moves beyond existing ideas of the nationalistic \(and jingoistic\) potential of popular music. Investigation of the individuality of these specific cities \(rather than simply the countries in which they are located\) as sites of the creation and consumption of popular musics before the twentieth century highlights a key finding of **Scott**’s research that commercial popular music develops a cosmopolitan character, challenging the focus on national traditions prevalent in earlier research in this area **\[1, 3, 4\]**. 

 Philosophical and societal distinctions between commercial and art music are explored through a combination of musicology and cultural history **\[1, 2, 3, 4\]**. The cultural impact of class on the creation and consumption of early popular musics contextualises the role of musicians and music\-making in different parts of society **\[1, 4\]** and has particular relevance for considerations of the musical demarcation of social demographics in large urban population centres such as London and other major cities. The role played by women in the development of the creative arts is explored through critical discussion of female composers and enables interrogation of societal views on gender and sexuality within the Victorian music\-making and wider artistic scene **\[1, 2\]**. Likewise, the cultural impact of ethnicity and race on the creation and consumption of early popular musics is contextualised through explorations of non\-white cultures, peoples, musics and musicians in late\-nineteenth\-century society **\[1, 2, 3, 4\]**. **Scott** also identifies a shift from amateur music\-making, through pursuits such as street performance, towards professionalism as the nineteenth century progressed. He observes connections between social standing, access to professional musical performance and matters of commerce, art and taste **\[1, 3\]**, as well as providing insight into the growth of domestic music\-making in the same period and the impact of this activity on cultural understandings of class and the livelihoods of those working in the popular\-music industry at this time **\[1, 3\]**. Through this multiplicity of approaches, **Scott**’s research is pivotal in effecting a paradigm shift away from previous models that standardise popular\-music criticism and fail to adequately explain the diversity even within a single popular genre. 

 **Scott**’s research into Victorian\-era musics also involves the performance of this repertoire, which he presents and contextualises with reference to his musicological research **\[5\]**. This is a rare example of the close coupling of academic discussion and critical performance in the area of popular music, and distinguishes **Scott**’s interdisciplinary and multi\-modal approach to research. His portfolio of performance\-as\-research forms a substantial repository that supports the sociological, aesthetic and commercial exploration of early light and popular musics, and facilitates informed engagement with these materials both inside and outside the academy.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Scott’**s research into early \(particularly Victorian\) popular and light musics and their cultures has contributed to numerous commercial productions. In every case, production teams have made their initial engagement with **Scott**’s research directly through publications including *The Singing Bourgeois* **\[1, F, I\]** and *The Victorian Web* **\[5, A, J\]**, as a result of broad knowledge of his research **\[A, G\]** or via recommendations from colleagues and other researchers **\[D, E\]**. 

 **Scott** was a ‘major consultant’ on the ninth instalment in the *Assassin’s Creed* video\-game series, *Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate* \(2015\), which VGCharts shows was the best\-selling game worldwide when released and remained in the global top 50 for 19 weeks. The Lead Audio Producer approached **Scott** to consult on the project, drawing on his research **\[1, 3, 5\]** to identify “what the most popular tracks of this era and this year were, or what kind of music was listened to in different places and by different classes” **\[A\]**, enabling the sourcing of period\- and location\-appropriate diegetic music. She asserts this was critical since “the cultural life in *Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate* is primarily represented by the musical activities of non\-player characters” **\[B\]**. Reviewers praised the game’s aesthetics, with several acknowledging implicitly the impact of **Scott**’s research on the musical validity sought by the creative team by highlighting the setting’s aural as well as visual richness. *Game Informer*’s Senior Reviews Editor notes that “\[t\]he Victorian\-era setting is among the series’ most mesmerizing and evocative, with grimy chimneys billowing smoke, people belting out songs in pubs”, and comments further “I wish the period songs weren’t relegated to tucked\-away taverns”, highlighting this critical part of the game’s soundtrack **\[C\]**. 

 Since 2014 fact\-based television programmes including *Who Do You Think You Are?* \(2014, 2017\), *Heir Hunters* \(2017\) and productions presented by Len Goodman \(2014, 2015\), Lucy Worsley \(2014, 2015\) and Frank Skinner \(2015\) have drawn on **Scott’**s research to ensure historical accuracy **\[1, 2, 3, 4, 5\]**. His research has enabled programme makers to present aspects of history, society and culture with confidence in the validity of their claims, supporting the fundamental premises of these shows. A researcher for *Heir Hunters* \(“a BBC 1 daytime programme about social history and genealogy” **\[D\]**\) drew on **Scott’**s research into “the historical sociology of popular music” for “the story of a street musician, performing on the streets on \[ *sic*\] London in the late 19th century” **\[1, 3, D\]**. Similarly, an assistant producer on *Who Do You Think You Are?* claims **Scott’s** research for episodes on Sheridan Smith \(2014\) and Warwick Davies \(2017\), which BARB reports reached seven\-day viewing audiences of around 14 million people, made an “invaluable contribution” to the programme **\[E\]**. 

 **Scott’**s research has informed radio programmes on topics ranging from the Eurovision Song Contest \(2014\) to crooning \(2016, 2018\). His most recent radio consultancy is for BBC Radio 4’s *A Singing History of* *Britain* \(2019\), which the producer states was “commissioned as \[a\] social history programme. I wanted us to say something about British culture, British society, British character and how that has evolved over time” **\[1, 2, 3, 4, F\]**. He encountered **Scott’**s research through *The Singing Bourgeois* **\[1\]**, “which seemed to be very much about unpacking our social history alongside music”, and credits **Scott** with helping him and the other programme\-makers “solidify some of the important areas we should be looking at \[…\]. Derek quickly understood what our programme was trying to do, and steered me towards the material that would be most useful” **\[F\]**. Similarly, the producer of the Stephen Fry\-narrated audio book *Victorian Secrets* \(2018\) approached **Scott** to consult on and perform incidental music for the recording **\[1, 3, 4, 5\]**. He argues **Scott**’s research “was key to the success of the project” **\[G\]** helping the audio book, a *Guardian* “pick of the week”, reach what he calls the “top of the Audible UK bestsellers chart” **\[H\]** only 10 days after release. He also notes that **Scott**’s work helped with the development of the script dealing with aspects of Victorian society sometimes seen as “a bit controversial” **\[G\]**, such as homosexuality and the role played by non\-white musicians. He asserts that **Scott** “was informative about the role of the minstrels \[…\] and told us about The Prince of Wales’s banjo lessons from a black Canadian player, which went in the final script. In the episode about male gay Victorians he provided the accordion music for a secret transvestite ball held in Manchester” **\[G\]**. More recently \(September 2020\), **Scott**’s research **\[1, 3\]** has informed the development of a UK/US\-produced television documentary \(Uplands Television and PBS\) presented by David Harewood, that provides the first critical examination of blackface minstrelsy and its legacy. 

 The impact of **Scott**’s research extends into print books and theatrical works. The author of the novel *Crow Court* \(London: Unbound, 2021\) asserts that **Scott**’s *The Singing Bourgeois* **\[1\]** was fundamental to his being able to write ‘The Peacock Shawl’, one of the episodes through which his novel is structured. He compares **Scott’**s research favourably to other scholarship on the Victorian period, concluding that “ *The Singing Bourgeois* is the only book I have come across that holds up Victorian Culture to an ideological light, and as soon as it does so, everything becomes so much clearer. \[…\] \[it\] is the only book I have read that gives such a clear\-eyed explanation of how such movements worked with the ideology of the time” **\[I\]**. Indeed, in the acknowledgements for ‘The Peacock Shawl’ he credits **Scott** and his research as impacting directly on the creation of this part of the novel, stating “Derek B. Scott was kind enough to read through ‘The Peacock Shawl’ \[...\] and his superb text, *The Singing Bourgeois*, was an inspiration for much of the background to that story”. **Scott’**s research into and research\-informed performances of Victorian\-era songs **\[5\]** enabled a director/co\-creator to realise an authentic socio\-cultural scenario for her theatrical piece *The Emily Triptych* \(2017\) based on the life and poetry of Emily Dickinson. The work was conceived for performance in New York and at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival \(2017\), and later refashioned under the title *Dickinson’s Room* in Adelaide, Australia \(2018\), a production acclaimed as a “unique and engaging piece of theatre” and “a little gem” in a *Stage Whispers* review. The director/co\-creator clarified the importance of **Scott**’s research to her process, stating that “as a non\-musician who does considerable research on period music every time I approach a theatrical project, I find recordings like Prof. Scott's immensely helpful. Especially when it comes to less well\-known material. Digging deep without the ability to read sheet music can be tough. What is more, such recordings are instrumental in helping me form a picture of daily life in a given historical period” **\[J\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In 2015, the United Nations \(UN\) unanimously agreed to eliminate Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting \(FGM/C\) by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, progress towards ending these harmful practices has been sporadic. Since 2016, Northumbria University has been investigating spatial and temporal trends in FGM/C using demographic and health datasets. This analysis enabled the UN to estimate that 68,000,000 girls worldwide are at risk of FGM/C by 2030. The research more accurately identified FGM/C hotspots which transformed the UN’s FGM/C programmes through better strategic allocation of over USD70,000,000 of UNFPA\-UNICEF funding \(2018\-2020\) across 17 countries. Northumbria’s research also identified new avenues of legal recourse, which led to The World Bank adopting a new legal and capacity\-building framework designed to hold states to account. These international changes have resulted in country\-level improvements in anti\-FGM/C efforts, including new initiatives in Kenya, Egypt, and the UK, as well as new legislation in Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea. Northumbria’s research also informed one of the key international policy documents focused on the elimination of FGM/C, the UN’s Human Rights Council’s resolution A/HRC/RES/38/6. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting \(FGM/C\) is an internationally\-recognised human rights violation. Its elimination is one of the targets under the United Nations \(UN\) Sustainable Development Goals \(SDG 5.3\). Northumbria University research, led by Professor Ngianga\-Bakwin Kandala, investigated spatial and temporal FGM/C trends to build evidence in support of international interventions in high\-prevalence countries. 

 In 2016, Northumbria University was commissioned by the Population Council to use innovative approaches to analysing successive household data in order to reveal FGM/C trends, geographic patterns, and risk factors among girls aged 14 and younger in Kenya. The research was conducted using a statistical modelling technique called survival analysis, which is utilised to estimate the expected duration of time until an event \(typically the occurrence of death or disease\). Professor Kandala realised that the age of girls’ genital cutting could be treated as an event for survival analysis. The innovative decision to use this form of analysis allowed for the interpretation of complex data sets with a dynamic interaction of factors \[ **R1**\]. This was enabled by advanced Bayesian geo\-additive modelling techniques. The study revealed the prevalent spatial and temporal trends across different geographical scales \(national, regional, county, district\), showing that whereas the overall number of FGM/C cases on a national scale had decreased between 1998 and 2014, some regions continued to exhibit large volumes of cases \[ **R1**\]. These high\-risk regions were identified as FGM/C hotspots. Funding of GBP362,000 for this work was awarded to Kandala by UK Aid and the UK Government through the Department for International Development\-funded project, *'Evidence to End FGM/C: Research to Help Girls and Women Thrive'*, coordinated by the Population Council \(grant number SR1801\). 

 The success of these novel techniques in revealing new insights into the prevalence and patterns of FGM/C was recognised by the United Nations Population Fund \(UNFPA\) and the United Nations Children’s Fund \(UNICEF\). Northumbria University developed the research to build a detailed, granular understanding of FGM/C practices for the ‘ *UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme to Eliminate Female Genital Mutilation: Accelerating Change*’ designed to estimate the number of girls at risk worldwide. Employing data sets from 17 countries spread across Africa and the Middle East, this research investigated the geographical variations of FGM/C practices over sustained periods of time \(1990\-2017\) in low\- and middle\-income countries \[ **R2**\]. Research revealed significant downward trends in FGM/C on the regional level in East Africa. By contrast, the decline in prevalence has been much slower in North Africa and West Africa. 

 Further work revisited FGM/C in Kenya \[ **R3**\], but also focused on new locations, such as Senegal \[ **R4**\] and Nigeria \[ **R5**\]. The objective of this research was to identify and map FGM/C hotspots in order to give an accurate picture of the dynamics of FGM/C in these countries. These studies recommended re\-allocating resources to FGM/C hotspots and using campaigns targeted at specific populations. Collectively, these studies demonstrated the importance of creating evidence\-based policies that account for the global trends in FGM/C as well as in\-depth understanding of the socio\-cultural differences between communities. 

 Northumbria’s research assessed individual\- and community\-level characteristics, as well as the geographical location of a girl and her mother. Other characteristics included socio\-demographic variables such as age of a girl and her mother, mother’s education, ethnicity, and household wealth. Researchers also developed a variable called the ethnic fractionalization index \(EFI\), which measured the level of ethnic mixing of a given community. Including the EFI variable in the models was justified by the hypothesis that different social norms may be inﬂuenced by different reference groups, with tolerance towards change higher among certain groups. In regions where there is little ethnic diversity, and where the prevalence of FGM/C is near\-universal, there may be little opportunity to shift to a reference group that does not uphold the practices. For example, the prevalence of FGM/C among the Somali ethnic group is high, irrespective of whether the group lives in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, or Tanzania \[ **R3**\]. 

 Northumbria researchers also conducted the first systematic interdisciplinary research study into the legal aspects of FGM/C on the global scale \[ **R6**\]. This research demonstrated a significant gap between existing regulations and enforcement practices on the ground. The authors argued that making states liable for the actions of FGM/C perpetrators and imposing penalties and compensation could encourage states to assume a more robust and proactive role in enforcing the law and allowing more victims to obtain redress \[ **R6**\]. The research demonstrated how international human rights law may be used effectively to make a difference to the lives of FGM/C survivors and enable their representatives to make arguable cases for civil remedies before the appropriate jurisdictions. The research was published as a book \[ **R6**\] and was supported by the World Bank’s ‘ *Empowering Women by Balancing the Law’* initiative.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 By utilising novel techniques to more accurately identify the number and characteristics of girls at risk of FGM/C, Northumbria University’s research has transformed international efforts to end the FGM/C practices. Through the UNFPA\-UNICEF programme and revised funding allocation strategy, Northumbria’s research impacted national roadmaps to end FGM/C in 17 African countries. The research led the World Bank to change its strategy on holding states to account and supporting legislators. This resulted in new legislation in three countries and improved efforts by other states. The research also informed a UN resolution on FGM/C. 

###  4.1 Transforming international efforts to end FGM/C through UNFPA 

 Prior to Northumbria’s research utilising survival analysis to identify the geo\-spatial distribution of FGM/C, the figures on the number of girls at risk used by UNFPA were outdated and incomplete \[ **E1**, p1\]. The new data generated by Kandala and his team on the distribution of FGM/C according to different variables \(age groups, ethnicity, religion\) and across geographical scales \(national, regional, county, district\) was adopted by the UNFPA\-UNICEF programme \[ **E1**, p1; **E2**\]. The research enabled UNFPA to account for the changes in population growth and allowed the agency to revise their data on girls and women at risk of FGM/C. Accurate calculation of the number of girls at risk is crucial for evidence\-based anti\-FGM/C efforts \[ **E1**, p1\]. The new method was applied across 17 high\-prevalence countries. Dr Nafissatou Diop, Chief of the Gender and Human Rights Branch at the UNFPA, confirmed: 

 ‘*Based on the survival analysis, Professor Kandala and his research team from Northumbria University and UNFPA demographers developed a methodology for analysing the annual number of girls at risk of FGM… This work provided the UNFPA with detailed, accurate and up\-to\-date representation of FGM prevalence… \[This\] allowed us to revise the earlier used incorrect number of 3 million of girls and women at risk of FGM… As a direct result of Northumbria University’s research, UNFPA started to use the new methodology of calculating number of girls at risk of FGM \(based on survival analysis of datasets\) … Once the analysis of number of girls at risk was completed for individual countries, we were able to calculate the aggregated number of 68,000,000 girls at risk of FGM by 2030’* \[ **E1**, p1\-2\]. 

 Dr Diop added: *‘The number of 68 million girls at risk by 2030 is frightening, and due to its frightening nature UNFPA was able to bring attention to FGM in international media and through an array of high\-profile events’* \[ **E1**, p4\]. In February 2019, UNFPA launched the ‘68 Million Girls at Risk’ exhibition that was presented in New York, Geneva, and Brussels. The new data about the numbers of girls at risk was vitally important in bringing the attention of media, policy\-makers, and the public to the issue of FGM/C, raising the visibility and urgency to eliminate the practices. UNFPA’s media analysis estimated the exhibition led to an estimated 4,660,000,000 \(non\-unique\) webpage views via the international media coverage \[ **E1**, p6\]. Dr Diop stated: *‘I am happy to note that… practitioners and advocacy groups around the world abandoned the previously\-used statistics of FGM, and now use more accurate and up\-to\-date FGM prevalence numbers based on survival analysis’* \[ **E1**, p4\]. 

 Furthermore, Dr Diop confirmed that Northumbria’s research *“transformed the Phase III of the ‘UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme on the Elimination of FGM/C: Accelerate Change’ \(2018\-2021\). Based on the new understanding of the FGM hotspots, UNFPA changed the way funding is allocated to individual countries on the programme”* \[ **E1**, p2\]. This transformation occurred in 2018 when, for the first time, UNFPA\-UNICEF funding was allocated to countries through a three\-tiered system that built on the research, to correspond to the number of girls at risk in each country \[ **E1**\]. Countries identified as having more girls at risk received more funding. In 2018, this meant the Tier 1 countries of Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and the Sudan received USD11,806,482 from a total raised of USD14,387,090 \[ **E3**, p107\]. The total funding for the project grew from USD14,400,000 in 2018 \[ **E3**, p107\] to USD25,800,000 in 2019 \[ **E3**, p190\], reaching USD30,000,000 in 2020 \[ **E1**, p2\]. Hence, over three years of Phase III, Northumbria’s research has shaped the allocation of over USD70,000,000 \(2018\-2020\). 

 In Tier 1 countries, new funding led to significantly stronger and more impactful anti\-FGM/C efforts. Dr Diop said *‘\[the new funding system is\] unquestionably changing the national efforts to eliminate this harmful traditional practice, as it allows national coordination bodies, third sector organisations, advocacy groups, legal practitioners, religious and traditional leaders to build capacity for resisting FGM’* \[ **E1**, p3\]. Two important examples are Egypt and Kenya. In Egypt, few steps were being taken to eliminate FGM/C, yet the number of girls at risk in the country was very large. The new funding directly led to a growth in the scale of ambition of anti\-FGM/C efforts and the strength of the national workplan \[ **E1**, p2\]. The new funding allowed Egypt to move away from small interventions into a full\-scale national vision in terms of education, communication, work with the ministry of health, and wider society’s perception of the issue. For Tier 1 country Kenya, the anti\-FGM/C allocation increased from USD500,000 in 2018 \[ **E3**, p109\] to USD4,500,000 in 2020 \[ **E1**, p2\]. Enhanced funding has enabled national anti\-FGM/C bodies and civil society to realise joint efforts to work towards the elimination of FGM/C and this has contributed to a presidential initiative to end FGM/C by 2022 \[ **E4**\]. The Population Council also reported that the research enabled them to work more closely with stakeholders in partner countries. For example, the research informed the Kenyan Anti\-FGM/C Board’s 2019–2023 strategic plan \[ **E5**, p19\]. 

 Northumbria’s research on the role of ethnicity in the prevalence of FGM/C also influenced where UNFPA directed interventions. Research findings were important, as they enabled coordination of policy efforts to eliminate FGM/C across borders. UNFPA worked with five countries \(Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Tanzania\) to develop cross\-border collaboration and legal and policy frameworks aimed at eliminating FGM/C \[ **E1**, p3; **E6**\]. In the UK, the same research enabled the UK’s National FGM/C Centre to identify specific communities at risk and allocate resources accordingly \[ **E7**\]. The Head of the National FGM Centre stated: ‘ *Kandala’s research has been indispensable to the success of our approach… The research has also been instrumental in identifying specific communities that practice FGM \(e.g. particular ethnic groups\)… For instance, without Kandala’s research we would not be able to put in place a better strategy for the safeguarding of children in the London Boroughs of Barking and Dagenham* \[ **E7**\]. 

###  4.2 Transforming legislative approaches through the World Bank 

 Northumbria’s research enhanced context\-specific understanding of FGM/C issues and, according to the World Bank’s Senior Legal Counsel: *‘As a result of Komba’s and Kandala’s research there has been a substantial transformation in the way in which The World Bank regards the role of the state in the face of FGM’* \[ **E8**, p2\]. In particular, the World Bank used the research to develop a new policy on creating legislation that enabled victims of FGM/C to hold states liable for failures to protect them against the practices \[ **E8**, p2\]. In February 2020, this led to new national legislation in Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea \[ **E8**, p2\]. 

 Advocacy programmes and training delivered by the World Bank in Africa have been influenced by the research, leading to the development of a new roadmap holding states to account for FGM/C practices. In Guinea Bissau and Equatorial Guinea, the research has been used to train 200 prosecutors, 140 lawyers, and 200 judges on litigation matters involved in the practices of FGM/C. This resulted in improved legal practice \[ **E8**\]. In Sierra Leone, research led to new evidence\-based recommendations for advisers and judges in magistrate and high courts. As a result, a record number of lawyers in Sierra Leone have taken action for compensation for victims of FGM/C \[ **E8**, p2\]. Thanks to these legal pressures, the World Bank is now seeing more efforts being made by the governments of Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and Equatorial Guinea to enforce the law to protect victims of FGM/C and to provide justice for women and girls affected \[ **E8**\]. The World Bank’s Senior Legal Counsel stated: ‘ *research by Komba and Kandala has changed fundamentally our approach to scrutinising the actions of governments in respect of FGM. The research by Komba and Kandala has provided new insights that we have incorporated into our own approach to FGM prevention and risk reduction*’ \[ **E8**, p3\]. 

###  4.3 Informing Human Rights Council’s resolution 

 Through the estimate that 68 million girls are at risk of FGM/C by 2030 globally, which emerged from research at Northumbria, the UNFPA was able to influence the adoption of a resolution by the Human Rights Council to eliminate FGM/C \[ **E9**\]. According to Dr Diop at the UNFPA: 

 *‘\[Northumbria’s research\] findings informed the policy brief developed by the African Union \(UNFPA’s formal partners\) for the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly \[2018\]. During this session, the African Union presented the resolution A/HRC/RES/38/6 on the elimination of FGM that took into account key evidence emerging from the UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme… Through the UNFPA\-UNICEF Joint Programme, Northumbria University’s research informed one of the key international policy documents focused on elimination of FGM… Furthermore, during the 44th Session of the Human Rights Council \[2020\], resolution A/HRC/L.20 on the elimination of FGM was adopted, which was based on the 2018 A/HRC/RES/38/6 resolution... These policy documents are used as reference to guide and assess countries progress… This shows the wide influence of our programme and Northumbria University’s transformative research’* \[ **E1**, p3\-4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Newcastle University research into formal modelling and design of asynchronous circuits and concurrent systems has laid the foundation to the development of industrial strength software “Workcraft”. Workcraft has been used by the microchip industry \(e.g., Dialog Semiconductor, Analog Devices\) to develop power\-management integrated circuits that are essential for saving electric energy and prolonging battery life in hundreds of millions of mobile devices around the world. 

 The design automation methodology that underpins Workcraft software improves productivity of electronic engineers from months to hours. Workcraft has also been used in training industry engineers and educating electronic engineering students. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Due to the widespread popularity of portable electronics such as mobile phones, there is an increasing demand for integrated circuits which are smaller, more complex, and yet cost\-effective. This has led to a rise in the use of Analogue and Mixed Signal \(AMS\) systems, in which both analogue and digital circuits co\-exist on a single chip. Increasingly, both analogue and digital parts are designed by the same team of engineers as it allows the overall AMS system to be holistically co\-optimized. AMS systems now play a vital role in monitoring a system's operating conditions, as well as distributing and regulating energy flows. However, AMS electronics is considered extremely hard to master, as the digital components must integrate seamlessly with the analogue parts, which are dynamic and notoriously hard to interface. 

 Newcastle University's longstanding research into the formal modelling of asynchronous and concurrent systems has inspired a new methodology for designing such systems, resulting in reduced inductor size and enhanced power conversion that responds to changes in demand more efficiently \[R1\-R4\].With energy becoming the most valuable resource in modern electronics, the responsiveness and robustness of power converters are crucial. Today’s chips make millions of control decisions every second, and a single mis\-step could cause malfunction or permanent damage. 

 The traditional approach to designing AMS control circuits relies on conventional synchronous components that require a clock frequency to be as high as 1 GHz, in order to meet the requirement of minimum latency of response, e.g. 1 nanosecond, to events generated by analogue components. This results in inefficient use of energy and a risk of failure. In contrast, using asynchronous logic for AMS control allows the system to operate at a pace that is determined by current operating conditions. AMS systems, however, need to keep evolving to track the advances in heterogeneous multi\-core systems architectures and of Internet of Things devices. 

 Newcastle University researchers tackled the issue of how to use asynchronous circuits as a control for analogue parts and as a front\-end for analogue\-to\-digital interfaces \[R1, R2\]. The methodology particularly draws on research into the use of Petri nets and causal representations of concurrent behaviour in electronic circuits \[R5\]. This has resulted in better power conversion efficiency, lower output ripple, faster response to analogue events, and reduced inductor size \[R3, R4\]. 

 Studies into the design of asynchronous VLSI circuits at Newcastle University date back to the 1990s, where Alex Yakovlev \(Lecturer/reader/professor of Computer Systems Design: 1991\- present\) developed the first formal model of the concurrent behaviour of such circuits Signal Transition Graphs \[R6\]. The research has since been carried out jointly with Maciej Koutny \(Lecturer/Reader/Professor\), Victor Khomenko \(Lecturer/EPSRC external research fellow/lecturer/senior lecturer/reader: 2003\-present\), Danil Sokolov \(Senior/Principal research associate\) and Andrey Mokhov \(Lecturer/Senior lecturer\) \[R1\]. 

 The resulting methodology has been implemented in several software tools \(such as Petrify, PUNF, MPSAT and PCOMP\), and in novel electronic components for interfacing analog and asynchronous parts \(WAIT, WAITX, SAMPLE\). It has also been integrated into a visual usable framework called Workcraft \[R1, R4\]. 

 Workcraft provides a flexible common framework for development of Interpreted Graph Models, including visual editing, \(co\-\)simulation, synthesis and formal verification. With Workcraft, the user can design a system using the most appropriate formalism \(or even different formalisms for the subsystems\), while still utilising the power of Petri net analysis techniques. The applications of the Workcraft framework are wide\-ranging: from modelling concurrent algorithms and biological systems to designing asynchronous electronic circuits and investigating crimes \(see workcraft.org\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Researchers from Newcastle University’s School of Engineering and School of Computing have developed new concepts, software and technologies that support the design and delivery of more reliable and efficient asynchronous systems. Their research has been incorporated into a visual toolset known as **Workcraft**. 

 Workcraft has been used by companies including electronic chip manufacturer Dialog Semiconductors, which paid for a bespoke version of the toolset to enhance the power conversion capabilities of its chips. Dialog’s principal client – Apple Corporation – invested US$600million in October 2018 to license some of Dialog’s power management technologies, acquire staff and assets, and support future research and development \[E3\]. 

 The Workcraft toolset is an open\-source project that is available publicly at workcraft.org. Additionally, after the initial stages of the R&D and impact creation in EPSRC project A4A \(2014\- 2017\), the project’s industrial partner Dialog Semiconductor supported R&D with their direct funding. Under this project besides open\-source software some novel bespoke functionality has been developed exclusively for Dialog Semiconductor. As a whole Workcraft was then used by the company to significantly enhance the power conversion capabilities of its chips. Dialog Semiconductor PLC is a multi\-national company which develops highly integrated mixed\-signal products for consumer electronics. It has approximately 1800 employees and offices in Europe, Asia and the USA \[E1\]. Its number one product is Power Management ICs. Its RapidCharge solutions for power adaptors boasted a 60% share of the rapid charge adapter market for smartphones at the end of 2017 \[E4\]. 

 The A4A project developed a novel design flow for the systematic development of asynchronous controllers for analogue\-mixed\-signal \(AMS\) systems, which has since been used in Dialog production chips \[E2\]. Newcastle University and Dialog co\-authored three papers in 2015 \[R2\], 2017 \[R1\] and 2019 \[R4\], demonstrating the advantages of asynchronous design methodology for AMS control. Simulation results indicated improved **reaction time, voltage ripple, peak current, and inductor losses, resulting in a higher efficiency of power conversion. These results meant that the size of coils could be reduced, a sizeable benefit for businesses such as mobile phone manufacturers, who see compact components and increased battery life and** **reliability as huge market drivers.** For example, it was reported at DATE 2017 \[R3, E2\] that for a 6μ load, an asynchronous control mentions peak current below 300mA using 1.8μH inductors. A synchronous control requires 10μH coils at 100MHz, 6.8μH at 333MHz, or 3.1μH at 666MHz \[E2\]. 

 Dialog extended its collaboration with Newcastle University following the end of the A4A project, providing an R&D project of over £500,000 to fund the further extension of Workcraft with new capabilities. Besides that, to date University has provided Workcraft tutorials to approximately 100 Dialog employees a year \(see: https://workcraft.org/training/start\). 

 In October 2018, Dialog announced that it had agreed a US$600million deal with Apple Corporation. The deal was the largest of its kind by Apple. Apple agreed to pay US$300million in cash to license certain power management technologies from Dialog, as well as to receive certain assets and over 300 employees to aid with chip research and development. The company also pre\-paid US$300million for Dialog products that would be delivered over the next three years. Dialog announced that it would continue to sell current and future generations of power management integrated circuits to Apple. Apple accounted for 75% of Dialog's total revenues this year, but the company expects that to drop to 35\-40% by 2022 \[E3\].In third quarter figures announced at the end of October 2018, Dialog announced record quarter revenue of US$384million, including a 3% year\-on\-year revenue rise in its Advanced Mixed Signal business. These results were collated before the Apple deal \[E4\]. In January 2019, it announced that its unaudited preliminary revenue for the full 2018 year was approximately US$1,442million \[E5\]. 

 Since 2017 a series of industrial track papers were produced in collaboration with Dialog Semiconductor for International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems \(ASYNC\). These papers are co\-authored with David Lloyd, who is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Dialog Semiconductor. Being research papers, they have a strong practical focus on the design aspects that are especially relevant to industry \[E7, E8, E9\]. The latter for example, is aimed to help engineers to perform automatic verification of their asynchronous handshake circuits with a generic usage, going beyond power\-management circuits. 

 Notably, as a further illustration of the impact generated by Newcastle research, in December 2020, Danil Sokolov was hired as a full\-time employee by Dialog to continue integrating Workcraft into the company’s R&D process \(Sokolov is remaining a Visiting Fellow at Newcastle University\). 

 While Dialog is the main beneficiary of paid extensions to Workcraft functionality, a version of the toolset is available for free download. This makes advanced formal design techniques more accessible to industrial developers, rather than restricted to experts in the domain. Since 2014, there were 32 public releases of Workcraft that were downloaded 20K times from 4.7K unique IPs \(data sampled on 23.01.2021\). The availability of Workcraft attracts other companies and is increasingly featuring in the teachings of the future generation of engineers in this field. 

-  Other companies that have evaluated integration of Workcraft in their design flows, invested in training of engineers and, are able to use it in the design of products include: Analog Devices \(evaluated in 2018, last training in 2019\), Nordic Semiconductor \(since 2015, last training in 2019\) \[E10\]. 

-  Universities that use Workcraft toolset in the learning process: Newcastle University \(CSC3324, EEE8043, EEE8087, EEE8124\) \(see https://www.ncl.ac.uk/module\- catalogue\), Technical University of Denmark \(02204: \(http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/courses/02204\), Southampton University \(ELEC6233 \-  [https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/elec6233](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/elec6233)\)

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Research from Sheffield Hallam University provided evidence that Midwife\-Led Continuity of Care \(MLCC\) models improve maternal and neo\-natal outcomes.  This informed **WHO guidance** and **UNICEF** **recommendations**, receiving personal endorsement from the **UN Secretary\-General**.  It also directly influenced **national policy** in the UK and Ireland, leading to significant additional **investment in midwifery training**, a **17% expansion of the midwifery workforce** in England, and a national roll\-out of the MLCC model.  Follow\-on EU\-funded research demonstrated that maternity peer supporters \(MPS\) can deliver important benefits for BAME, and migrant, asylum\-seeking and refugee \(MAR\) women.  The integration of MPSs into the roll\-out of MLCC has brought further individual and community benefits and has **improved outcomes for at\-risk and marginalised perinatal women**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Midwives are primary care providers for childbearing women around the world. However, there has been a lack of information to establish whether there are differences \- in morbidity and mortality, effectiveness, and psychosocial outcomes \- between midwife\-led and other models of care. This lack of knowledge has led to disputes around best practice, both within and between countries, affecting major decisions about the roles and responsibilities of midwives, relations with other healthcare professions and investment in the midwifery workforce. 

 MLCC models provide a woman with care from the same midwife, or a small team of midwives, during the pregnancy, birth and early parenting period, with referral to obstetric care as needed. An MLCC Cochrane review \( **R1**, **R2**\) synthesised international evidence from trials evaluating models of maternity care, and relevant outcomes for childbearing women and their babies. This was the most extensive review ever undertaken of MLCC models compared with standard care, encompassing 15 randomised controlled trials, with 17,674 mothers and babies from Australia, Canada, Ireland and the UK. It was a Cochrane collaboration between Sheffield Hallam University \(Soltani\), Warwick University, National University of Ireland in Galway and King’s College London. Soltani was a key collaborator in formulating and designing the original review protocol in 2004, first published in 2008 \( **R1**\) and updated in 2016 \( **R2**\). With expertise in maternal and infant health systematic reviews, she has continued her role in all aspects of the Cochrane reviewing processes since then. 

 The research found clear benefits of MLCC compared to conventional care models for childbearing women. These women were: 24% less likely to experience pre\-term birth, 19% less likely to lose their baby before 24 weeks' gestation, and 16% less likely to lose their baby at any gestation. They were also more likely to have a vaginal birth, fewer interventions \(instrumental birth, amniotomy, epidural and episiotomy\), with a higher likelihood of having a more positive labour and birth experience. 

 In 2017 Soltani’s expertise was sought locally by the Sheffield Health and Social Care NHS Foundation Trust, to carry out research on the experiences of pregnant ethnic minority women, including migrant women, who are considered particularly vulnerable and with a higher likelihood of complications. Sheffield has attracted large groups of migrants, asylum\-seekers and refugees \(MAR\) for decades and it is the UK’s first ‘City of Sanctuary’. Soltani \- with Watson, Harrop and Young from Sheffield Hallam, and Walton from University of Sheffield \- conducted a systematic review of the evidence, and an exploratory survey about ethnic minority and migrant women’s experiences of perinatal mental health services in the region \( **R3**, **R4**\). This revealed that migrant women need ‘trauma aware care’ and culturally\-competent, compassionate healthcare providers who listen to them.  They also need respectful, dignified and equitable perinatal care, undergirded by interdisciplinary team\-working and continuity of care, aligned with cultural peer supporters. 

 This led to a multi\-centre EUR596,000 EU\-funded feasibility study titled ‘Operational Refugee and Migrant Mothers Approach’ \(ORAMMA\), in partnership with collaborators in Greece and the Netherlands. Pregnant MAR women are considered high risk; newly arrived in strange environments where local people do not speak their native languages, without support to link them to local services, and with traumas associated with conflicts in their native countries and their passage to Europe. The aim was to develop and test a model of perinatal care comprising continuity of care pathways, integrated with specially recruited maternity peer supporters \(MPS\) for the pregnant mothers and their babies, in the three participating countries. The study \( **R5**\) recruited 43 MPSs \(17 in Sheffield\), working alongside 17 midwives \(5 in Sheffield\) and 72 mothers \(20 in Sheffield\). The findings of the study, along with the team’s systematic review of migrant women’s experiences of perinatal care services in Europe \( **R6**\), reinforced the validity of MLCC principles and demonstrated the crucial roles played by MPSs in maintaining engagement with MARs \- the route to securing positive birthing outcomes for them. The findings from MLCC and the ORAMMA project were used to inform the design of ‘culturally sensitive and trauma aware’ training packages for MPSs and midwives. The training package was tested with 35 midwives and showed significant improvements in knowledge, skills and self\-perceived cultural competence domains \( **R5**\), preparing them for working with MARs.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has generated significant demonstrable international, national and local impact for different beneficiary groups. This has spanned **global guidance**, **national policy** and **ministerial decision\-making**, and resulted in midwifery **workforce expansion** and a national MLCC model roll\-out. The MLCC research has featured in the ‘Cochrane Making a Difference’ series, which highlight examples of impact on real world health decision\-making and outcomes \( **E1**\). Additionally, among migrant, asylum\-seeking and refugee \(MAR\) women, the recruitment of maternity peer supporters \(MPS\), who themselves are from migrant/minority backgrounds and share their heritage and experiences, has been directly connected to the generation of individual, social and community capital.  In 2020 Soltani was awarded an **MBE in recognition of her impact on and services to maternal and infant health**. 

####  Informing International Guidance and National Policy 

 In 2016 the **World Health Organisation** \(WHO\) recommended the MLCC model for all women worldwide, through a series of documents. The MLCC review \( **R2**\) was among 41 Cochrane reviews which informed WHO’s *Recommendations on Antenatal Care for a Positive Pregnancy Experience* \( **E2**\). These evidence\-informed recommendations “ *relevant to all pregnant women*”, with the purpose of informing health policies and clinical protocols globally, stated that: *“Midwife\-led continuity\-of\-care models… are recommended for pregnant women”.* \( **E2**\). 

 The importance of this guidance was emphasised by **United Nations Secretary\-General,** **Ban Ki\-moon** in the document foreword: *“To achieve the Every Woman Every Child vision and the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health... I welcome these guidelines, which aim to put women at the centre of care, enhancing their experience of pregnancy and ensuring that babies have the best possible start in life.”* \( **E2**\). 

 In 2019 both the WHO report *Strengthening Quality Midwifery Education for Universal Health Coverage* \( **E2**\) and the WHO/ **UNICEF** report *Survive and Thrive* \( **E2**\) cited **R2** and recommended universal implementation of MLCC to improve mother and baby outcomes. 

 The MLCC review was also cited as key evidence to inform models of care in Ireland’s first *National Maternity Strategy \- Creating A Better Future Together 2016\-2026*, in 2016, with continuity of care\(r\) described as *”fundamental to the strategy”* \( **E3**\).  In Scotland, **R2** informed the *Continuity of Carer and Local Delivery of Care: Implementation Framework* for *The Best Start* maternity care policy in 2019, which aimed to enable continuity of care support in every health board \( **E4**\). 

  

####  Investment in Midwifery Training and Workforce Expansion 

 The incorporation of the MLCC research into key national reviews of midwifery practice since 2016 has led directly to investment in midwifery training and workforce expansion in England. Launching the National Maternity Review, *Better Births \- Improving Outcomes of Maternity Services in England* \(E5\), Parliamentary Under\-Secretary of State \(PUSOS\) for Health, Baroness Cumberlege, stated that: ” *\[R2\] provided… evidence of the benefits of continuity of midwife care for women and their families in terms of lower perinatal mortality and preterm birth, as well as a better experience for women. This new evidence directly influenced our work in the NHS England... and resulted in continuity of care becoming one of our seven key priorities”* \( **E5**\). 

 Citing the MLCC evidence and describing it as “ **the largest ever investment in midwifery training”**, **the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt**, announced in March 2018 that, to achieve MLCC, the NHS would train 3,650 extra midwives over 4 years, with 650 more the following year, and further increases of 1,000 in subsequent years \( **E5**\). In January 2020 PUSOS, Baroness Blackwood, confirmed significant progress towards these goals, citing that UCAS admissions to midwifery courses had increased by 425 in the academic year 2019\-20 \( **E5**\). 

 Overall, in response to these policy changes, there has been a steady expansion of midwifery workforce, with a total **increase of 16.9% in the number of midwives** from March 2016 \(33,246\) to September 2020 \(38,855\), according to NMC register database \( **E5**\). 

####  National Roll\-Out of The MLCC Model 

 Several national documents have reported progress in implementing MLCC, such as *Safer Maternity Care* \(Department of Health, 2017\) and *Better Births Four Years On: A Review of Progress* \(NHS England and NHS Improvement, 2020\) \( **E5**\).  The latter of these confirmed that *”*c *ontinuity of carer pathways have now been implemented across nearly all provider Trusts”*, while also identifying where the gaps were and where progress needed to accelerate to deliver the Maternity Transformation Programme’s aims.  The roll\-out was also bolstered by the *NHS Long Term Plan’s* 2019 commitment to ensure services implement continuity of carer models for at least 75% of women of BAME backgrounds and those in deprived areas by 2024, as a means to reduce health inequalities \( **E5**\). 

####  Benefits for Marginalised Groups of Women 

 **BAME groups:** The *NHS Planning Guidance 2019/20* \( **E6**\) set out an expectation that services should implement continuity of carer models for women of BAME backgrounds and those in deprived areas. There have been seven early adopters of this, paving the way for a national roll\-out.  Provisional analysis of MLCC implementation in North\-West London, an area of high diversity and deprivation, identified positive outcomes, including increased control of gestational diabetes and rates of breastfeeding at 6 weeks \( **E7**\). 

 **Migrants, asylum seekers and refugees \(MAR\):** Additionally, by integrating MPS and MLCC through the ORAMMA project, the continued impact showed that MAR women have overcome a sense of isolation and loneliness, whilst being empowered to articulate their needs and to make informed decisions essential to their safety and wellbeing during their pregnancies \( **E8**, **E9**\): *""It was good because sometimes you can't go with a husband for different reasons and \[I\] loved it.""* \(MAR Participant 6\) \( **E9**\) 

 **Maternity peer supporters \(MPS\):** their video narratives \( **E9**\) demonstrate a sustained social impact after the life of the project \- incorporating skills development, boosts to self\-esteem, career\-building and satisfaction from having helped vulnerable women \( **E8**, **E9**\): *“\[It was good for me too, to\] get a job, have training in level 1 interpreting and I am doing level 2…  I gained experience, expanded knowledge... I applied for a Nursing course \[and\] joined a refugee council as a volunteer, helping migrant women with breastfeeding.”* \(MPS Participant 4\) \( **E9**\) 

 The social capital generated through the bonding between MPSs and MARs enhanced communication with midwives \( **E9**\): *“Once the lady gave birth she was so happy... like her sister was there, the relationship was so friendly… With her midwife sometimes she was shy to ask, \[so\] this was very important for her communication.”* \(MPS Participant 4\) \( **E9**\) 

 These connections have also grown and widened post\-project to the point where, in Sheffield, they are strengthening community networks and generating new forms of organisation \(E8\). Sheffield MPSs have remained active in liaison with local perinatal charities and organisations, such as the Red Cross, Forging Families, Sheffield Maternity Cooperative and Light\-Sheffield. Originally a loose network of volunteers, the MPSs have evolved to a volunteer group called ‘Friendly Mothers’ who share information about lifestyle and reproductive health matters \(doubling in numbers to 40 members\), demonstrating adaptation, growth and sustainability. The group set up its own WhatsApp group to aid communication and knowledge sharing among its members during the Covid\-19 pandemic \( **E8**\). Following a presentation of the ORAMMA project at the online Migration Matters Festival \( [migrationmattersfestival.co.uk/2020/maternity\-peer\-support](http://www.migrationmattersfestival.co.uk/2020/maternity-peer-support)\), several charities expressed interest in the MPS scheme and are seeking funding to set up their own projects. One of these, perinatal support charity Light\-Sheffield \( [lightpeersupport.org.uk](https://lightpeersupport.org.uk/)\), successfully obtained GBP10,000 National Lottery Community Fund funding to adapt the ORAMMA training and continue the work with MPSs in the city to support the marginalised MAR pregnant women \( **E10**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research into Strategic Technology and Innovation Management approaches and tools at the Institute for Manufacturing \(IfM\) at the University of Cambridge has benefitted businesses, non\-profit organisations and charities in developing strategies and plans for shaping the future of their organisations. **\[text redacted for publication\],** was instrumental in developing the successful EUR1,000,000,000 proposal for the EU Graphene Flagship which currently has a workforce of 1675, is driving new approaches to workplace well\-being in the rail sector and creating jobs, and is guiding the deployment of new technologies for search and rescue by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. IfM supports translation of the research into practice by working collaboratively with organisations to develop strategy ‘roadmaps’ and by helping organisations develop in\-house roadmapping capabilities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at the Institute for Manufacturing \(IfM\) at the University of Cambridge has led to new planning methods and tools that support organisational strategy and decision making. Structured approaches to planning developed in the research aid organisations in developing ‘roadmaps’ for identifying new opportunities for growth and support the management of risk. The structured roadmapping approaches are underpinned by visual toolkits developed in the research. 

 Early research focussed on roadmapping approaches for strategy and planning for businesses in technology\-intensive fields where the rate of change is high and markets can be disruptive. In \[R1\], general characteristics of technology roadmaps were identified and a ‘fast\-start’ roadmapping process was introduced. The developed roadmapping approach is a combination of process, e.g. structured workshops, and visual tools for articulating and communicating a roadmap. The fast\-start method was illustrated in \[R1\] for two cases in the context of disruptive technological trends. The research in \[R1\] was developed into the concept of integrated toolkits in \[R2\] for technology management. The plethora of tools and processes that are available to support management decisions may not interact consistently, robustly or transparently, and \[R2\] addressed this issue and proposed how to work consistently and robustly across management planning tools. 

 Further research focussed on the effective development and application of strategic technology management tools in industrial settings based on collaborative deployments with industry \[R3\]. This included the roadmapping toolkits themselves, managing the complexity of roadmapping, and the social aspect of how groups within a business can best collaboratively develop effective and successful roadmaps for technology management. Seven principles were defined in \[R3\] – human\-centric, workshop\-based, neutrally facilitated, lightly processed, modular, scalable, visual – for the development of strategic technology toolkits that are industrially relevant and academically robust. 

 Roadmaps are visual tools, and the value of visual tools were advocated and demonstrated in \[R1, R2, R3\]. In \[R4\] the visual/graphic design of roadmaps, which had been largely overlooked, was considered. The research investigated the importance of graphic design in communicating roadmaps effectively, and in particular how design supports alignment of the roadmap presentation with the target audience. The research proposed a methodology for developing visual designs driven by a set questions for the designer. The design approach was demonstrated in \[R4\] using roadmaps for the EU\-funded Graphene Flagship \(a EUR 1 billion programme, launched in 2013\), with designs considered for two groups: programme funders and industrial stakeholders. A roadmap for the Graphene Flagship is shown in Figure 1. 



 Figure 1: An example of one of the roadmaps from the EU Graphene Flagship. 

 A feature of the underpinning research is that the early developments have been further developed and refined in close collaboration with businesses from a wide range of sectors, and the necessary adaptions for different sectors investigated. In \[R5\] Kerr and Phaal explored with the LEGO Group the deployment and customisation of roadmapping processes, starting from reference approaches \[R1\] and investigating and reporting on adaptions and implementation in LEGO context. This research provided guidance on how organisations can approach the adaption and configuration of reference strategic roadmapping approaches and tools for their specific circumstances.

 The application of roadmapping research conducted at the University of Cambridge has led to improved business performance and practices, and the adoption of new technologies for businesses and non\-profit organisations. The translation of roadmapping research into practice is accelerated by IfM’s Education and Consultancy Services through training courses and consultancy. Between 2014 and 2019, IfM has supported organisations through over 400 roadmapping and visualisation projects, generating over GBP5,000,000 in project revenue, and training courses for over 500 participants \[E1\]. The Strategic Technology and Innovation Management Consortium was formed at IfM in 2013 to connect roadmapping research to practice. In 2020 the consortium had 20 members, including De Beers, GlaxoSmithKline, Huawei, Johnson Matthey, Michelin and Subsea 7. 

 **Subsea 7** is a global engineering business with 14,000 employees delivering offshore projects and services. Since 2015, Subsea 7 has worked with IfM on roadmapping to guide their corporate strategy. **\[text redacted for publication\]** \[E2\].

The **Rail Safety and Standards Board \(RSSB\)** supports the rail industry in Great Britain in improving the health and safety performance. In 2013 the RSSB estimated that sickness and absenteeism was costing the industry GBP316,000,000 per year \[E3\]. In the Winter of 2013, IfM worked with RSSB to create a roadmap for the industry’s strategy and vision for health and well\-being \(see opposite for the Roadmap itself\). The Roadmap has been guiding initiatives to improve health and wellbeing since 2104. 

 “*Roadmapping enabled us to bring together views from over 60 organisations to create a plan that is guiding the direction of activity in relation to the key strategic themes. We have progressed significantly in the last four years from a situation where organisations were questioning the activity they should be doing to an acceptance of the importance of health and wellbeing across the rail sector. UK rail organisations are increasing the numbers of health experts and budgets for health initiatives within rail companies. As an example, one large organisation has gone from employing one person in occupational health to employing 18, with similar investment across a number of organisations. . . The roadmap has had the biggest single impact on what we are doing in health and wellbeing and is fundamental to the progress we have made and our plans moving forward.”*

 The **EU Graphene Flagship** used roadmapping in developing its successful 10\-year, EUR1,000,000,000 Future and Emerging Technology Flagship programme bid \[E4\]. The industry\-academic collaboration to develop and apply graphene in industry launched in October 2013. The Flagship workforce was 1,675 strong on March 2016 \[E5\], and it had 78 industrial partners in 2019 \[E6\]. Roadmapping is used in ongoing strategic planning, with in\-house capacity now in place. 

 *“The roadmap that we prepared together with the Cambridge team in connection with the flagship proposal has proven much more accurate and robust than anyone could expect. It summarizes our plans in a condensed, visually appealing way, and is still used when presenting the Graphene Flagship to diverse audiences. We have since formed our roadmapping activities to a tool that is continuously updated and provides key input when we plan the next stages of our work.”* 

 Director of the Graphene Flagship, Chalmers University of Technology \[E4\] 

 **The Royal National Lifeboat Institution \(RNLI\)** has used roadmapping since 2016 to support their goal of halving the number accidental coastal deaths by 2024 through technological advances. Outcomes of roadmapping include \(i\) establishment in April 2019 of a 12\-month trial of unmanned aerial vehicles for searches in hazardous locations, \(ii\) withdrawal of RNLI investment in bespoke systems where commercial investment was increasing, and \(iii\) trialling of new systems for securing donations \[E7\]. 

 “*Our use of current and emerging technologies will be more effective if we have a comprehensive view what’s going on across the sector, helping us to collaborate with the right organisations on the right projects. Roadmapping is playing a significant part in how we are doing this.*” 

 Future Lifesaving Innovation Lead, RNLI \[E7\] 

 **John Hogg Ltd,** a manufacturer of chemical marking systems for protection against counterfeit and tampering, worked with IfM in 2017 to create a new business strategy and embed roadmapping within the organisation. Impacts include \[E8\]: 

-  Reallocation of GBP1,400,000 in R&D investment to focus on other key growth areas. 

-  Investments in new equipment and new staff to improve operation efficiency by 20%. 

 On the roadmapping approach: 

 *“We felt that for us as an SME the return on our investment was high. Not only did it help crystallise our vision for the business, it gave us confidence in our decision\-making.”*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Our development of novel algorithms for combined real\-time object detection, classification, 

 localisation and tracking within automated wide\-area surveillance, carried out between 2013 and 2016 at Durham University, directly: 

-  informed **UK government** science, technology and procurement policy for technical interface standardisation within wide\-area, multi\-sensor surveillance systems. 

-  informed scientific policy\-making activity by the **governments of UK, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand** and **Netherlands** on wide\-area, multi\-sensor surveillance systems. 

-  informed the design, development and evaluation of wide\-area surveillance sensors and associated technologies that were developed commercially by **AptCore, Autonomous Devices, Blue Bear Systems Research, Createc, Cubica Technology** and **QinetiQ**. 

 This directly contributed to GBP23.2 million investment in multi\-sensor surveillance systems \(UK/US government/industry\), GBP11.9 million of additional commercial income and supported the creation of \~55 additional science and engineering jobs across six organisations \(2013\-2020\).

###  2. Underpinning research 

 This research uses automated image understanding to provide long\-term wide\-area surveillance of dynamic scene objects \(people, vehicles\) addressing questions such as \- *“Is there anything there?”* \(detection\), *“What is it?”* \(classification\), *“Where is it?”* \(localisation\) and *“What is its behaviour?”* \(tracking\). The key challenge is to be able to address these issues within real\-time processing constraints \(“as it happens”\) and within the processing capability available within the size, weight and power \(SWaP\) constraints of a field\-deployable, long\-duration sensor unit. The Durham research team were able to introduce the idea that all\-weather, long\-term automated visual surveillance addressing all of these key questions could be achieved in real\-time, within such a field\-deployable unit, by the integrated co\-design of both the sensor units \(hardware, \[R4\]\) and the associated algorithms \(software \[R1\-R3\], Fig. 1\). Furthermore, we were able to develop a novel set of algorithms, suited specifically to our key design decision to perform sensing in the far\-infrared \(thermal\) spectrum, enabling real\-time processing performance within a field\-deployable, all\-weather sensor unit. 



 *Figure 1: Field\-deployable thermal imaging sensor units developed by Durham University \(left/middle\), and vehicle detection/tracking integrated within the SAPIENT user interface \(right\) – \(Crown copyright\).* 

 This sensor unit design \(hardware\), and associated real\-time algorithms \(software\), contributed to the design and validation of a novel wide\-area surveillance concept that allowed sensors of varying capability and sensing modality to participate in a common sensor network by dynamically declaring availability, integrity and capability via a common interface \[R4\]. 

 The key findings of this Durham\-based research were that: 

 • robust all\-weather detection and classification of pedestrians \[R1\] and vehicles \[R3\] can be achieved in real\-time, within a limited field\-deployable computational footprint, using far\-infrared \(thermal\) sensing and a unique algorithmic combination of a multiple mixture of Gaussian background models to overcome inherent variations within the thermal imagery coupled with a feature\-based foreground classification model \[R1,R3\]. This meant that objects could be detected and classified by type \(pedestrian \[R1\], vehicle \[R3\]\) during long\-duration sensor deployment despite extreme changes in environmental conditions \(illumination, temperature\). 

 • photogrammetry can enable the passive recovery of 3D object position within the scene relative to the camera within far\-infrared \(thermal\) video imagery and deliver positional accuracy to within the expected error bounds of GPS \(for object localisation, \[R1\]\). Furthermore, the expected impact of variations in human pose \(for pedestrian targets\) on this accuracy could be readily overcome via the use of the regressive posture estimation and subsequent algorithmic correction \[R2\]. This meant that objects detected and classified within the scene, could be tracked within real\-world 3D co\-ordinates via the use of photogrammetry based algorithms \[R1, R2\] without the need for active sensing as accurately as if explicit GPS trackers were placed upon the objects themselves. Our ability to process 3D object localisation in real\-time further facilitated an extension to commonly\-used Kalman filter based tracking, traditionally used for 2D pixel\-wise object tracking, to full 3D object tracking in the scene \[R1, R2\]. 

 • the combined use of detection, classification and \(3D\) tracking within far\-infrared \[R1\-R3\] further enables the robust secondary classification of objects to determine sub\-type \(for vehicles \- car, van, 4x4, HGV \[R3\]\) or behaviour \(for pedestrians \- running, walking, loitering, digging, crawling \[R1, R2\]\) based on an accumulated feature representation \[R1\-R3\]. 

 • imperfections in the combined detection/classification/localisation/tracking capability of any deployed sensing modality and associated processing, such as far\-infrared \[R1\-R3\], can be mitigated via integration into a non\-homogeneous sensing network, via a suitably defined common interface specification, such that these short\-comings within current ambient conditions can be overcome via fusion with complementary sensing technologies \[R4\]. 

 This Durham\-based research contributed to the SAPIENT \(Sensing for Asset Protection using Integrated Electronic Networked Technology\) project \(2014\-2016\) that developed a novel integrated, multi\-modal wide\-area surveillance network such that “ *individual \[deployed\] sensors make low\-level decisions autonomously … \[and\] are managed by a decision\-making module which controls the overall system ... to reduce … the need to constantly monitor the output of the sensors.”* \[R4\]. This joint research was carried out in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(DSTL\) \(system requirements\), QinetiQ \(systems integration, visibleband camera sensors\), Cubica Technology \(decision\-making module\), AptCore \(radar sensors\), Createc \(laser range sensors\) and Durham \(thermal imaging sensors\) resulting in a joint publication \[R4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Effective wide\-area surveillance is a key area of interest within both military operations and in civil infrastructure protection as it offers *situational awareness* – i.e. knowing *what* is happening and *where* it is happening within the environment \(source: MoD Science & Technology Strategy, 2017\). 

 Whilst the specification and evaluation of the operating requirements for these surveillance tasks is a policy matter for government, the technical development of sensing technologies to meet these requirements is carried out by commercial suppliers. In the UK, government science and technology policy in this area is informed by the UK **Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(DSTL\)**, an executive agency of the UK Ministry of Defence whose aim *“is to maximise the impact of science and technology for UK defence and security”* \(DSTL\). The research work at Durham \[R1\-R4\] has had both policy and commercial impact within this area. 

 **Impacts of Durham research on UK government policy are as follows:** 

 • informed UK government science and technology policy for wide\-area surveillance systems by enabling the UK **DSTL** to perform the *“design, evaluation and validation of a new common interface specification for integrating varying types of intelligent networked sensors .. with direct reference to the performance characteristics of the \[Durham\] all\-weather, all\-condition camera\-based thermal ... and the … requirements of the state\-of\-the\-art real\-time object detection, classification and tracking algorithms \[provided by Durham \-R2, R3\]”* \[E1\]. This was supported by *“a total budget of GBP3 million \(2013\-2016\), with additional technical and management support from \~10 DSTL staff scientists” \-* DSTL \[E1\]. The resulting UK government science and technology policy publication \(SAPIENT Middleware Interface Control Document \(ICD\)\) was publicly released under the UK Open Government Licence at \( [http://www.gov.uk/sapient](http://www.gov.uk/sapient)\). Paul Thomas, Principal Scientist at DSTL, commented that this enabled *“an important step forward in enabling sensors to ‘plug and play’ … \[a\] significant benefit both in the area of civil security such as the protection of infrastructure and in military systems such as for base protection.”* \[E2\]. 

 • informed UK government scientific policy\-making activity by enabling the **DSTL** to test and evaluate SAPIENT “ *for integrated wide\-area surveillance within the inclusion of the thermal imaging solution provided by Durham \[R1\-R3\], against a range of staged scenarios”* including *“two large\-scale technology demonstrations to inform \~60 senior personnel spanning UK military and civil infrastructure protection \(from **UK Ministry of Defence \(MoD\), Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure, Home Office, Dept. Transport**\) of the ‘art of the possible’ for integrated wide\-area surveillance … \(Malvern, Sept. 2015 / Throckmorton Airfield, June 2016\)”* \[E1\] and technical evaluation “ *against a range of unmanned aerial system \[drone\] targets flown in a variety of attack trajectories, using radar and electro\-optic \[sensors; R4\].”* \[E3\]. *“The demonstrations provided an excellent showcase of sensor technology that was very useful in helping both military and civil \[policy\] stakeholders understand the progress, and more importantly the potential, for the technology.” \-* DSTL \[E1\]. 

 • informed the UK government procurement policy for wide\-area surveillance systems via the **Defence and Security Accelerator \(DASA\).** This led to the SAPIENT Middleware ICD, enabled by Durham research \[in R1\-R4\], being adopted as the preferred interfacing option for commercial system suppliers to the UK MoD across GBP11.3 million of commercial research and development funding \(2017\-2020\) \[E4\]. Furthermore, SAPIENT has been adopted for autonomous sensor management within the joint **US Army / UK MoD** procurement *“Signal and Information Processing for Decentralized Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance”* \(W911NF17S0003\-US\-UK, USD1.2 million, 2020\). The UK Minister for Defence Procurement, Andrew Stuart MP, commented that by informing policy within UK defence procurement, SAPIENT *“can act as autonomous eyes in the urban battlefield. Investing millions in advanced technology like this will give us the edge in future battles. It also puts us in a really strong position to benefit from similar projects run by our allies as we all strive for a more secure world.”* \[E2\]. 

 • enabled **“**collaborative experimentation internationally between the **\[governments of the\] Five Eyes allied nations of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the USA** in the Contested Urban Environment experiment involving over 150 government and industry scientists and over 80 Canadian troops for three weeks in Montreal \(2018\)”* \[E1\]. This provided the five nations with a means to evaluate a range of differing sensors and operating methods for effective wide\-area surveillance based on the work of \[R1\-R4\] and informed the policymaking work of defence research scientists in the UK and partner nations. DSTL Chief Executive, Gary Aitkenhead, commented *“\[SAPIENT\] is a fantastic example of our world\-leading expertise at its best; our scientists working with our partner nations to develop the very best technology for our military personal now and in the future.”* \- \[E2\]. The collaboration has also informed the surveillance requirement policy of the military end user. 



 *Figure 2: Briefing and site walk\-around with demonstration attendees \(upper\), view from Durham sensor units \(lower, left\) and integrated multi\-sensor visualisation via the common graphical display to operator \(lower, right\) – June 2016 \(Crown Copyright\).* 

 *“\[SAPIENT\] brings together our requirements as a user and DSTL as scientific advisers ... with our key allies in the five\-eyes community.”* said Lt Col Nat Haden, SO1 Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Capability, **British Army** Headquarters \[E2\]. 

 • enabled **TNO \(Netherlands, government research agency\)** to perform *“rapid integration of raw and processed sensors by using open standards and the SAPIENT interface”* \[E3\] designed and validated using \[R1\-R3\] \(2018\). This allowed the **Netherlands government** to develop and evaluate additional novel sensing approaches to inform policy\-making in wide\-area surveillance and enabled international technical collaboration, via the SAPIENT ICD \[E1\], with UK\-based commercial defence supplier, **QinetiQ** \[E10\]. 

 • enabled the UK **DSTL** to perform *“ongoing development of SAPIENT, via the DSTL\-led SAPIENT Interface Management Panel, to the current SAPIENT Middleware Interface Control Document \(Issue: 5.0, 11th May 2020\) supported by an investment in excess of GBP5 million \(2016\- 2020\) and \~20 research scientists”* \[E1\] in order to revise and progress UK government science and technology policy in this area \(2016\-2020\). *“.. without the work of the Durham research team DSTL would not have been able to validate the performance and design of the SAPIENT interface or evaluate the SAPIENT concept of operation \(con\-ops\) against the operating characteristics of this militarily important sensing modality. Moreover, the capability of the Durham \[sensor\] for detection, tracking and classification of behaviours … of pedestrians \[R1, R2\] provided a cogent demonstration of the military and security relevance of the wider SAPIENT system.”* \- DSTL \[E1\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The photographic research project *Urban Gypsies* by Wenham\-Clarke is focused on a small group of Irish Travellers living beneath the Westway, a major route into highway in London. It has provided a unique insight into the lives of this community and thereby challenged commonly held public perceptions of contemporary British Travellers. The photographs and accompanying texts, cascaded widely across print and social media, have provided an alternative to the stereotypical views of the Travelling community perpetuated by the popular media. The research highlighted continued public prejudice against the community and the challenges they face, fighting for the survival of their cultural identity, under pressure to conform to societal norms, with their freedom to travel greatly curtailed. The impact of the photographic images has been to inform the public about the inequalities of modern life, to challenge public perception and to encourage a greater acceptance of cultural diversity. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research began in 2011. The underpinning activity was based on a project to visually document the different communities living and working beneath the Westway, a substantial elevated highway that links the M40 to central London, located in an inner\-city area in one of the most deprived parts of the UK but conversely situated in one of the most affluent boroughs, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. These communities included a riding stable, sports facilities and businesses and also a small group of Irish Travellers. 

  

 In the 1960s and 70s many groups of Travellers moved closer to cities as their traditional ways of earning a living diminished and they needed to find new sources of income. The Irish Traveller community of the UK were once all fundamentally nomadic people but this lifestyle was discouraged by national and local government who encouraged Travellers to adopt a more settled life on official sites. The Westway Travellers reflect this process of forced consolidation as they arrived in the late 1960s and the designated site became official in 1976. 

 Whilst the Travelling community is a subject of fascination to wider society, their representation is invariably misleading, exoticised or mocked. It is invariably negative. In contrast, Wenham\-Clarke sought to provide a unique insight into the lives of this small Irish Travelling community that rarely gives access to those on the outside of it. Using photographic images to capture key life events accompanied by contextual narratives explanatory text, he sought to use visual images to show the community as they themselves chose to be depicted. 

 Wary of aggravation, Wenham\-Clarke adopted a ‘roundabout’ approach, initially photographing all the groups living under the Westway except the Travellers. Finally, some eight months into the project, Wenham\-Clarke was invited by a long\-term resident into the site to photograph the Travellers ‘on their terms’, covering family events and celebrations. Access was only granted on condition that Wenham\-Clarke continued to seek and obtain permission as he went. The project involved taking a series of photographs of twenty traveller families while alongside conducting over twenty interviews that examined what it was like to be a Traveller. Drawing on narrative and oral history and employing qualitative research methods the interviews were designed to explore their experiences over a 40\-year period. The works were not intended as surveys and the locations and individuals photographed were selected with qualitative impact in mind. The research was essentially sociological, identifying individual behaviours, patterns of experience, and/or issues and responding to them in ways that were intended to generate public debate. 

 Wenham\-Clarke worked tirelessly and patiently to win the confidence of individuals within the community gaining unprecedented access into their homes. The project took over two years to realise. Invited to attend key life events such as weddings, christenings, first communions and birthday parties, these formal occasions are documented visually through a series of photographs that provide unique insights into a community that rarely gives access to those outside. 

 Wenham\-Clarke’s research found that the Travellers’ world was changing as their nomadic existence was no longer tolerated by many local councils leading to them having to adopt a settled life. Attending local schools, meant increased contact with their surrounding community, finding life\-partners who were not Travellers, which in turn was leading to a gradual demise of their culture. In contrast to commonly held misconceptions, the Travellers did pay tax and they did pay rent for living on the site. The research also showed that the new generation had lost ‘their will to roam’ with many believing that the end of their way of life was only one or two generations away, as they gradually became assimilated into the wider population. 

 The research also gave a unique insight into their culture, finding that the Travellers get married quite young and had large families with traditional marriages in which the wife stayed at home with the husband going out to work; divorce was frowned upon. Travellers do not smile for the camera feeling no need to falsify their appearance for the photographer. Their children had an old\-fashioned kind of childhood, playing outside for hours every day. It found that that the Gypsies thought that non\-Travellers were obsessed about owning everything, spent their lives longing for retirement and did not live their lives for today. 

 The narrative statements and interviews that accompany the photographs highlighted continuing persecution and discrimination against the Travelling community. They shone a spotlight on the tremendous pressures that continue to be applied to these marginalised groups from local communities and the wider society that views them as a persistent problem, described by a Parliamentary Enquiry \(2019\) as the *Last acceptable form of racism.* For example, the Travellers held their parties in local pubs, but only certain places would accept them. Many venues said ‘no’ as soon as they realised that it was Travellers that were trying to book, ‘they were fully booked’. Many of the men did not want to be photographed for fear of losing work if they were identified as Travellers by outsiders. Although locals thought that the Travellers got the site for free, they in fact rented the site from the council, paying a decent amount of money to do so. But with so many families living closely together and with more children growing up, this had gradually led to overcrowding. 

 A selection of the work was chosen for 2013 *Westway* exhibition at St Martin’s in the Fields with some images selected for prestigious photographic prizes including the Sony World Photography Awards and Taylor\-Wessing Photographic prize and exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery and Somerset House. In 2019, 45 images were published in the form of a book including images and accompanying statements from the Travellers. The research received wide media coverage across Britain, Europe, the US and Australia connecting with audiences of hundreds of thousands, far beyond photographic and academic communities. 

 The research details how the Travellers’ world is changing with their nomadic existence no longer tolerated by authorities and, as they will have lost their freedom to roam, the gradual demise of their culture.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The Government estimates that there are between 100,000 and 300,000 Gypsies and Travellers living in Great Britain. Ethnicity is one of the protected characteristics identified in the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998. Gypsies and Travellers should therefore be protected from discrimination together with all ethnic groups who have a particular culture, language or set of values. However, Gypsies and Travellers are among the most socially excluded and politically disempowered groups in British society. The Parliamentary Enquiry which t **ackled inequalities faced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities** noted it has been acknowledged for many years that Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people have the poorest outcomes and experience the ‘last respectable form of racism *’ \(2019\).* 

 In contrast to some TV shows which have exploited negative perceptions of the travelling community for entertainment purposes, Wenham\-Clarke’s photographs have challenged stereotypical views of the travelling community perpetuated by the popular media: 

 *The photographs testify to Wenham\-Clarke’s ability to build long\-term relationships of trust with a group of people particularly wary of photographers, journalists, filmmakers and other outsiders equated with misrepresentation or mockery. The project makes an important contribution to the documentation of a historically marginalised group in London whose representation more often than not plays into negative stereotypes. \(* **S5\)**. 

 They have informed the public, by allowing them to see inside the traveller community as they wanted to be portrayed, without commercial incentives: 

 *It has been a good experience being able to say what we feel knowing it won’t be edited* 

 *out which is what normally happens when we deal with the media.* *We talked about all the difficulties and racist attitudes we have faced and still face.* **\(S3\).** 

 *They offer nuanced and sincere depictions in the face of pervasive negative stereotypes*. **\(S9\)** *Wenham\-Clarke avoids the photographic clichés that often plague documentary photographers. He uses his commercial skills to create technically flawless, but intimate portraits that present the Gypsies as modern people, not as society’s problem.* **\(S1\).** *He \[Wenham\-Clarke\] started to photograph ‘stuff’ that they \[the Gypsies\] wanted capturing, becoming a conduit to capturing life of modern\-day Travellers through the imagery they wanted to convey. In effect helping to give the Traveller community a voice. Having worked with Gypsy and Traveller families for more than two\-decades, I am very aware that this level of trust is rare*. **\(S2\).** 

 *The Travellers have had many challenges over their time on The Westway site, but the greatest has been to maintain their cultural identity. The book clearly records the community’s struggles and helps the reader look beyond the stereotypes and see the world from a Traveller’s point of view.* **\(S4\).** 

 Extensive press, media and social media coverage of the prize\-winning photographs enabled the images to be seen by broad audiences internationally. *The images resonate beyond the photographic or art world.* **\(S1\).** The accompanying text, including oral histories gathered as part of the project, reached hundreds of thousands of people through wide dissemination in print publications such as Marie Claire, the i\-newspaper and Polka magazine **\(S6\).** This has challenged public perception providing un\-prejudiced insight into the lives of the Travellers: 

 *In combination, they encourage viewers to challenge their prejudices and perceptions of Travellers and to look beyond the common stereotypes* **\(S5\)**. *The images show how colourful, sometimes skimpy and often glitzy outfits that us ‘gorgers’ \(a name the travelling community give to non\-Travellers\) have seen plastered over the television and in the press over the years; this time taken on their terms, delivering a first\-hand look into their lives free from prejudice and stigma, and confirming just how strong a community these ‘urban gypsies’ really have*. **\(S8\).** *This kind of personal insight is needed to raise the understanding of contemporary Traveller and Gypsies, to highlight the levels of inequality they face on a far too regular basis*. **\(S2\).** 

 On\-line publications with international circulation enabled the images to be seen across the globe, with features in *CNN Style* \(USA\) **\(S7\)**, *Post* \(Italy\), *Kwerfeldein* \(Germany\), and *news.com.au* \(Australia\) in addition to UK based publications such as *Time Out* and the *Face,* addressing misconceptions: 

 *It’s a common mistake among outsiders to think that Travellers are only Travellers if they are on the go. London is their home. What the pictures show is that Traveller life is fundamentally about community. Freedom isn't just the freedom to escape. It's also the freedom to be together*. **\(S7\).** 

 The 2016 Housing and Planning Act removed with protections for those with a ‘cultural tradition of nomadism or of living in a caravan’. The images have informed the public about inequality within modern life: 

 *Yet, poignant shots of the static caravan site, and the backdrop of inner\-city London, reflect on the housing crisis the Travellers face and the risks this poses to their identity. A reduction in traditional stopping places and authorised sites, as well as the increasing value of urban land, mean many families based in large cities are forced to assimilate and move to bricks\-and\-mortar housing. This overt pressure allows Paul to draw attention to power and inequality in cultural and social life*. **\(S9\).** 

 *Life is difficult for our community as we are being forced to live in a different way to our traditions and the book has helped to make non\-travellers realise what we are going through.* **\(S3\).** 

 With this unique lifestyle under threat, the images document a closed society whose very existence is threatened: 

 *The resulting photographs are an intimate portrait of a close\-knit community, whose cultural* 

 *identity and way of life seem precarious in a rapidly gentrifying city.* **\(S10\).**

 Philip Horne is a leading expert on Henry James. Through critical books, articles, and major editions, Horne’s research has shaped contemporary academic engagement with this major figure of 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century literature. Horne’s research covers a wide range of areas, but is unified by a mission to reveal new aspects of James and tell untold stories though a combination of close reading, original research and editorial scholarship in relation to published and unpublished works, and an interest in the implications of James’s unique literary style and his evolving fictional technique. 

 Horne is founding General Editor of the *Complete Fiction of Henry James* for Cambridge University Press. Nine of the projected thirty\-four volumes of this major critical edition have been published since 2008. Horne is also Series Editor of the Penguin Classics Henry James and in 2011 published his edition of *The Portrait of a Lady*, in the introduction of which he argued for the importance of that novel’s experimental daring. One example of this is how the prose requires readers to attune themselves to the narration’s psychological subtlety, whereby deeply significant realities are not named or marked as such by James but represented indirectly \[ **R1**\]. 

 Horne edited *Henry James: Autobiographical Writings* for the Library of America, published in 2016 on the centenary of James’s death, 28 February 1916 \[ **R2**\]. Horne insisted on unusually full \(for the series\) explanatory notes in order to ensure the reader could adequately contextualise these three complex books James wrote about his early life. He also selected other autobiographical material \(essays, tributes, reminiscences from the Notebooks\) to complete the volume and enrich readers’ understanding of the three texts. 

 Horne’s research on the significance of French short story writer Guy de Maupassant in James’ Notebooks led to \[ **R3**\], which argues for the ways in which Maupassant was not only a technical model for James, but also a creative source of inspiration. Horne’s extensive archival work on these Notebooks, which has included compiling a carefully corrected text for inclusion in the Cambridge University Press series, demonstrates that the two longstanding editions of the Notebooks \(1947 and 1987\) fail to meet modern scholarly standards, as described in ‘Letters and Notebooks’ \[ **R4**\]. 

 This research also uncovered a productive series of over 60 unused story ideas and fragments, eleven of which are the basis for the short stories written for *Tales from a Master’s Notebook: Stories Henry James Never Wrote* \[ **R5**\]. This collection of new stories by major contemporary novelists inspired by the ideas in James’s notebooks was conceived and edited by Horne. His introduction reflects on the question of creative inspiration and contextualises how the contents of James’s nine surviving notebooks – private spaces in which he communed with his art – enabled the authors to write stories that give their own ‘impression of life’ \(not Jamesian pastiches\). The collection’s appendix reproduces James’s original notes, allowing readers to trace the raw ideas through to their modern\-day interpretations. 

 With Tamara Follini, Horne edited a special issue of the *Cambridge Quarterly* entitled *Henry James in the Modern World* \(2008\) to which he contributed ‘“Reinstated”: James in Roosevelt’s Washington’ \[ **R6**\], part of a larger project on James and Roosevelt. Examining James’s letters concerning his visit to Roosevelt’s White House in 1905, Horne revealed the nuances of James’s resistance to U.S. imperialism and dislike of Roosevelt, and his complex reactions to American politics and culture more broadly.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Henry James’s writings are often seen as difficult and elitist. However, Philip Horne’s work has changed the way that that this important novelist is represented in contemporary culture. His research on James’s notebooks \[ **R3**\] \[ **R4**\] brought about the co\-creation of *Tales from a Master’s Notebook: Stories Henry James Never Wrote* \[ **R5**\], a collection of short stories by 10 major contemporary novelists, which generated new avenues for their creative practice and sparked new ways of thinking about James’s influence and timeliness for writers and readers alike. The collection grew out of the Henry James Reading Group led by Horne, which has improved wellbeing for attendees and enhanced professional practice both within and beyond the creative industries. Horne has also deepened pre\-existing audiences’ knowledge of James’s work and influenced others’ reading practices through innovative public events and media engagement. In particular, Horne has humanised James for modern audiences – presenting him as a biographical subject on one of BBC Radio 4’s flagship programmes, *Book of the Week*, and in articles in the *Times Literary Supplement* – and demonstrated his continuing contemporary vitality through public events commemorating the centenary of James’s death in 2016. 

 **Facilitating cultural production and generating new ways of thinking for writers** 

 Horne’s work on the manuscripts of James’s notebooks \[ **R4**\] has led to **the co\-production of a new cultural artefact**: *Tales from a Master’s Notebook* \[ **R5**\], an anthology of short stories written by contemporary novelists. His research, and the open approach he encouraged them to take as described in \[ **R5**\], influenced **the creative practice of the critically acclaimed and award\-winning contributors**: Susie Boyt; Amit Chaudhuri; Jonathan Coe; Giles Foden; Tessa Hadley; Joseph O’Neill; Colm Tóibin; Rose Tremain; Lynne Truss, and Paul Theroux. Many of the writers acknowledged the significance of the close relationship with James’s fiction made possible by Horne’s research \[ **R5**\]. Jonathan Coe found the process ‘made me think again about Henry James, a writer I don’t read often enough, yet whose influence on contemporary fiction of all kinds cannot be underestimated’ \( **A**\). For Joseph O’Neill, this was ‘an extraordinary opportunity to steal the ideas of a genius and put them to some use’. His story in \[ **R5**\], ‘The Poltroon Husband’, was serialised in *The New Yorker* \(12 March 2018\). Highlighting the significance of the opportunity to work with Horne as ‘the planet’s leading Henry James scholar’, O’Neill described how ‘Rifling through the ideas of an immortal as if they were one’s own is uncanny and exhilarating \[…\] James’s ideas are \[…\] packed with latent drama and very fresh’ \( **A**\). 

 Writing for *Tales* **provided some of these authors with an opportunity to experiment with a form they used less frequently**. For Jonathan Coe, for example, ‘Writing my story ‘Canadians Can’t Flirt’ \[…\] was an important experience for me. First of all, it made me attempt to write short\-form narrative, a form which I normally shy away from.’ It also **influenced the genesis of Coe’s critically acclaimed novel **Middle England**, which went on to win the 2020 Costa Book Award and the 2019 Prix du Livre Européen: ‘above all, it made me create two characters – most notably the fictitious English novelist Lionel Hampshire – who subsequently appeared in my novel *Middle England*, which would thereby have been a poorer and lesser book without the inspiration and stimulation that came from Phil’s commission’ \( **A**\). O’Neill attests to the **impact on his creative and teaching practice**, writing that ‘I wrote a story that would never otherwise have occurred to me; and I found the experience so valuable that I repeated the exercise with my writing students at Bard College’ \( **A**\). 

 It was also **an opportunity for writers to reflect on form and their own practice**: for Susie Boyt her involvement ‘not only deepened my understanding of Henry James’s short stories, it also made me think differently about the relationship of the short story to the novel both in James’s writing and my own. \[…\] The conversations that took place around the collection, with Philip Horne and some of the other contributors, were stimulating and illuminating. \[…\] Style is very important to me as a novelist, but attempting to produce well\-made prose that also feels contemporary is something I already struggle with so it was particularly useful to face this challenge head on’ \( **A**\). Tessa Hadley testifies that it was **a liberating experiment**: ‘The invitation to provide a story for \[ **R5**\] was an exciting opportunity to give license to the temptations that otherwise you're mostly holding off, as a writer. To try to feel yourself inside a story dreamed up by Henry James, to try to find some way of making sentences from that beginning which were your own and yet echoed the way his imagination might have moved around such a subject...  It was an exciting experiment in writing, broadening and liberating my own practice’ \( **A**\). 

 The short\-story collection has been described in the *Times Literary Supplement* \( *TLS*\) as ‘\[an\] ingenious and entertaining collection... the stories could not be more varied in tone and approach’, where ‘the appreciation of his unwritten tales by 11 fine contemporary authors pays handsome dividends’ \( *Sydney Review of Books*\) \(p.9 of **B**\). The book has sold over 1300 English\-language copies, and a Chinese translation came out in 2019 and has sold a further 1565. Horne also curated a feature in the *Guardian Review* to coincide with *Tales’*s release: ‘“Messy attics of the mind”: what’s inside a writer’s notebook?’ \(6 April 2018\), which has been shared 248 times online and included contributions from Horne and Boyt, Theroux and Chaudhuri who ‘muse\[d\] on their own use of notebooks and the Jamesian ideas that inspired them’, connecting for the reader Horne’s research to the practices of contemporary writers \(p.14 of **B**\). 

 Horne began the Henry James Reading Group in 2014, which led to this collection, and which has met 90 times across the impact period \(and has continued online through the Covid\-19 pandemic\). The reading group has generated **new ways of thinking that influence creative practice and benefit wellbeing and professional practice beyond the creative industries.** The group has approximately 100 members and meetings are usually attended by 15\-25 individuals. They include authors Hadley and Boyt, alongside journalists, lawyers and senior public servants. These sessions provide unusually fertile occasions for contemporary novelists to reflect on their own work as James\-inspired writers, as well as being an accessible and egalitarian forum for enhancing understanding among non\-academic audiences. In the *Guardian* Boyt described how such reading groups influenced her own creative practice: ‘For 25 years I have attended Henry James reading groups so his voice often appears \[in my notebooks\], almost casually, like a distinguished neighbour dropping round’ \(p.17 of **B**\). \[Text removed for publication\]. 

 **Enhancing public understanding of James’s work** 

 Horne demonstrates James’s continuing contemporary vitality and approachability, and has **changed how contemporary readers engaged with and commentators have responded to his works.** Horne contributed to a dozen events in 2016 to commemorate the centenary of James’s death which alongside his contributions to media coverage and original programming cumulatively reached an audience of at least 2,055,000. A talk based on \[ **R2**\] about the experimental nature of James’s autobiographies, given in February 2016 at the Grolier Club in New York, had received 3548 views on YouTube by 14/08/2020 \( **D**\). The most significant event Horne organised that year was ‘Henry James \(April 15, 1843–February 28, 1916\): A Commemoration on the centenary of his funeral’, which took place in the same place, Chelsea Old Church, 100 years later to the day, on 3 March 2016. Horne conceived the commemoration: he and Tessa Hadley spoke, while Simon Paisley Day, Miriam Margolyes, Olivia Williams, Alan Hollinghurst, and Oliver Herford gave readings. 140 attendees were introduced to passages from James’s Notebooks and fiction chosen by Horne; these drew upon his publications including \[ **R1**\] and \[ **R2**\]. Anthony Lane described in *The New Yorker* how ‘Spoken in public, \[…\] they make more immediate and graspable sense \[…\] Given that James, bewilderingly, dictated \[ *The Golden Bowl*\] in the first place, you could argue that to hear it aloud is somehow to restore the text to its original form’. For Lane, the readings recontextualised James’ fiction, demonstrating its relevance to audiences today: \[ *What Maisie Knew*\] ‘dispel\[led\] any lingering contention \[…\] that \[James\] neglected the issues of his day \[…\] Divorce and custody are the issues of *any* day, more so now than ever’ \(p.5 of **E**\). Michael Caines wrote in a *TLS* blog \(31 March 2016\): ‘I hope I'll remember \[this event\] for a long time to come, not least for \[…\] the excellent readings \[…\] When the soprano Anna Sideris stood in front of the altar to sing ""How beautiful it is"", from Benjamin Britten's operatic adaptation of *The Turn of Screw*, that clinched it. This was art apotheosized’ \( **E**\). 

 Horne’s regular contributions to broadcast and print media open up new ways of reading James for audiences invested in engaging with his novels. In the *TLS*, ‘A Last Wintering’ \(3 March 2016\), on James’s last illness, death and funeral, Horne introduced a wider audience to the themes of the commemorative event, bringing out how even after a stroke and in an often confused state the dying James retained his wit and imagination \(print circulation 45,000\). A podcast accompanying Horne’s later article ‘Sense of the West’ \( *TLS* 20 September 2018\) about Henry James’s 1905 visit to Los Angeles, which builds on \[ **R6**\], has had 6,253 listeners \( **F**\). In the week of the centenary of the funeral, BBC Radio 4 broadcast, ‘Book of the Week: The Real Henry James’ \(29 February to 4 March 2016\). Book of the Week had a 9.7% share of audience in the first quarter of 2016 \( **G**\). These five 15\-minute programmes in a prime slot introduced listeners to James’s lesser\-known non\-fiction writings and the insights these provide into British and American society of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. Horne conceived of and pitched the programme, wrote the scripts containing excerpts from letters, memoirs, essays and private notebooks \(informed by \[ **R2**\], \[ **R3**\], \[ **R4**\], \[ **R6**\]\), and was present for recording. The producer commented that Horne ‘used his extensive research into the journalism of Henry James to select fascinating material for a general audience \[which\] would only previously have been known to scholars. He produced a wealth of material and then worked with the producer to select passages which would work best for the Radio 4 programme. He wrote linking sections introducing James’s writings, giving context and explaining them. He also suggested the readers \[Henry Goodman and Olivia Williams\], whom he had worked with before, and they both agreed to do it because of his involvement. The programmes were highly praised by the commissioning editor at BBC Radio 4 and reached an estimated audience of 2,000,000’ \( **G**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Looking at the precursors for the Nigeria\-Biafra war \(1967\-70\), examining the war itself and considering its collective memory, ‘Legacies of Biafra’ takes a Janus\-faced approach to history. Coinciding with the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the war, Dr Louisa Egbunike’s research centres Nigerian voices in a project encompassing a large\-scale exhibition at the Brunei Gallery in London, feature\-length documentary film, and public engagement events. ‘Legacies of Biafra’ has succeeded in opening conversations previously suppressed and expanding deeper understanding of the ‘invisible genocide’ against the Igbo people, not just within the Igbo community itself but outwardly across the global Nigerian community and the 12,000 exhibition visitors and film attendees in the UK, Ghana and Kenya. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Nigeria\-Biafra war lasted three years, following Biafra’s secession from Nigeria in 1967 in the wake of a pogrom against Igbo people. This historical episode is at the centre of Egbunike’s research, which consists of intertwined academic and practice\-based outputs.  Her ongoing research \(on themes including the Igbo\-Nigerian literary tradition, the intersection of literary and historical narrative, and orality\) engages critically with Nigerian cultural production stemming from the Nigeria\-Biafra war, showcased not only in peer\-reviewed publications **\[3.1, 3.2\]** but also through her roles as curator for the *Legacies of Biafra* exhibition and catalogue **\[3.3, 3.4\]** and as producer and co\-writer of a documentary film with collaborator, director Nathan Richards, *In the Shadow of Biafra* **\[3.5**\]. A common thread which runs through Egbunike’s publications, film and exhibition is a focus on writers and artists who have either directly or indirectly been impacted by the war. 

 Egbunike’s 2017 book chapter ‘On Intertextual Conversations’ **\[3.1\]** examines the literary work of Akachi Ezeigbo, a Nigeria\-based writer who, whilst providing an important voice for her generation, has not received adequate scholarly attention. Ezeigbo’s novel *The Last of the Strong Ones* charts the arrival and impact of British forces in what would become Eastern Nigeria. The colonial divide\-and\-rule policies set the stage for discontent amongst Nigeria’s culturally and linguistically diverse peoples and pre\-empted the civil war that would ensue in the decade following independence in 1960. The chapter considers the genre of the historical novel and explores the ways in which creative writers use their work to engage with traumatic moments in history. Egbunike is at the same time interested in literary traditions, and specifically examines the intertextual relationship in Akachi Ezeigbo’s framing of colonial contact with the writing of her literary predecessor, Chinua Achebe. The chapter reads against the grain of existing scholarship on Ezeigbo’s work as ‘writing back’ to Achebe and suggests instead that Ezeigbo’s work is located in a constructive dialogue, grappling with this historical moment in the formation of Nigeria. In doing so, ‘On Intertextual Conversations’ **\[3.1\]** identifies a decolonial and intergenerational tradition of writing which centres ‘the people’s’ narratives of traumatic periods in their collective past. 

 *In the Shadow of Biafra* **\[3.5\]** employs a similar framework to ‘On Intertextual Conversations’ **\[3.1\]** in so far as the documentary film is centred around intergenerational conversations amongst writers grappling with a period of conflict and trauma in Nigeria’s history. The film’s structure echoes that of a literary essay by engaging with the works and perspectives of creative writers who have written on the war; this is interspersed with critical contributions from academics who are scholars of war literature.  Perspectives from third generation writers \(since independence\) such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Nnedi Okorafor are placed alongside the perspectives of second\-generation writers such as Okey Ndibe and Akachi Ezeigbo, and first generation writers such as Chukwuemeka Ike. The film’s editing process sought to generate new avenues for conversation by placing the perspectives of writers whose works were shaped by first\-hand experiences of the war alongside works from a younger generation whose writing was heavily informed by the curated memories of others. The connection between Ezeigbo’s engagement with Nigeria’s colonial past in her novel *The Last of the Strong Ones*, and the Nigeria\-Biafra conflict provided the foundations for Egbunike’s interview with Ezeigbo in the documentary film **\[3.5\]**. 

 In the curation of *Legacies of Biafra* **\[3.3\]**, Egbunike sought to translate the conversations she had instigated in her literary scholarship into her curatorial practice. She selected works from four generations of artists \(including an Uzo Egonu piece created in the 1970 and works by Obiora Udechukwu, created in the 1980s\), exploring intertextual references across their works and placing a spotlight on intergenerational conversations in the wake of the conflict. These narrative threads were then further emphasised through Egbunike’s wall text in the gallery. The exhibition catalogue **\[3.4\]** includes a series of academic essays and creative writing which draw on specific pieces from the exhibition or on the exhibition in its entirety as sources of inspiration. The collection was edited by Egbunike, who also provided the exhibition’s scholarly underpinning in her introduction. 

 In her 2017 book chapter ‘Narrating the Past’, **\[3.2\]** Egbunike explores Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s concern with how historical narratives are constructed, whose perspective they present and what purpose they serve. Engaging with Adichie’s war novel *Half of a Yellow Sun,* Egbunike suggests that the narrative asserts a reclamation of the people’s history, having posed the question of who should tell the story of the Nigeria\-Biafra war. The chapter presents the fluidity and flexibility of oral cultures as a counterpoint to the rigidity of colonial culture; it explores how Adichie incorporates references to orality as a way of demonstrating the active role that Igbo people \(the largest ethnic group in Biafra\) played in recording, transmitting and reimaging their collective past. The importance of centring Igbo perspectives on the war, as a way of giving voice to those who were victims of what Chima Korieh has called an ‘invisible genocide’, provided the foundation for both the exhibition and film. By its very nature, the documentary film centred oral accounts from a number of writers and scholars.  Works by poet and performer Amarachi Attamah lamenting the devastation of Biafra were commissioned specifically by Egbunike; these works punctuated the discussion in the film and are firmly rooted in Igbo oral tradition. 

 In the conceptualisation of *In the Shadow of Biafra* **\[3.5\]**, it was imperative to centre Nigerian voices, particularly those who had lived through the war or for whom the war featured prominently in their writing.  Egbunike’s interview with Adichie in the film **\[3.5\]** takes ‘Narrating the Past’ **\[3.2\]** as a starting point for developing a discussion around how oral histories informed the writing of her war novel, *Half of a Yellow Sun*. In the film, Adichie relays the ‘emotional truth’ of her narrative which is rooted in the stories shared by her older relatives.  Adichie’s intellectual project of centring Nigerians in the recounting of their history informed the basis for Egbunike’s curatorial approach to ‘Legacies of Biafra’ **\[3.3\]**.  As curator, Egbunike drew her methodological approach from considerations of agency and perspective, and so the majority of content in the exhibition e.g. artwork, documentary films, music and books on the war were created by Nigerians from different ethnic groups. 

 Given the centrality of oral cultures in Nigeria, Egbunike made a curatorial decision to include a listening post with testimonials from those who had lived through the war and Igbo choral music from the period. In doing so, the exhibition identified Nigerian people as active agents in the formation and rethinking of the nation’s history, rooting this assertion in the cultural practices of its peoples.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Concurrent to the *Legacies of Biafra* exhibition held at the Brunei Gallery in London, which opened with a lecture delivered by Booker Prize\-winning novelist Ben Okri, Egbunike worked in close collaboration with filmmaker Nathan Richards to create a documentary in order to engage with a cinema\-loving audience that might not necessarily visit museums and galleries. *In the Shadow of Biafra* **\[3.5\],** *a* 73\-minute feature film showcasing some of Nigeria’s most prominent literary figures, had multiple preview screenings in the UK, Ghana and Kenya involving post\-screening Q&A feedback sessions, and premiered on the 25th of January, 2020 at Curzon Bloomsbury on the Renoir screen before a full\-capacity \(148 seats\) audience.  Combined, the exhibition and film have raised and improved awareness of the Biafran war to a global audience of more than 12,000 visitors and attendees **\[5.1\]** and prompted the Office of the Vice\-President of Nigeria to write to Egbunike, requesting connections and memorabilia because “ *although the Biafran War was far from a highpoint in \[Nigerian\] history, we cannot fully deliberate on where we currently are as a nation without talking about it*.” **\[5.2\]** 

 **Speaking the unspoken through curation and film** 

 Egbunike’s research contributes to the untangling of complex histories, which in turn contributes to understanding the challenges of the future.  As she notes in the catalogue’s introduction, the conversation about Biafra and its legacies is a difficult one. **\[3.4\]** Through the work of 15 artists, the story of the war unfolds, leaving many visitors “ *speechless and crying*.” One exhibition visitor from Florida in the US commented “… *it is relevant to the world today—\[memories\] make this unforgettable*” and others were affected similarly **\[5.3\]**: 

 *“Spread the story—the world will know our struggle.”* 

 *“Thanks for opening my eyes to Biafra…it has hit me very hard.”* 

 *“Very informative, beautiful pieces that express the feeling of the horrors experienced.  Thanks for aiding human awareness and understanding.”* 

 *“This has been very insightful. What surprises me though is the fact that nothing has changed. I wonder when we will ever learn.”* 

 *“Informative, beautiful and moving.”* 

 *“Thank you for bringing to life child migrant stories.”* 

 *“\[This exhibition\] has allowed me to connect with my country in a new way.”* 

 The Head of Galleries & Exhibitions of SOAS expressed how *Legacies of Biafra* is one of the Brunei Gallery’s most successful African\-related exhibitions and events programme to date:  ""… *while also engaging with the Nigerian community there was a change in visitors’ awareness and understanding of this crucial point in Nigeria’s political history discovered by a new audience*” and they stated how the accompanying exhibition catalogue **\[3.4\]** \(of which approximately 800 copies were sold\) **\[5.4\]**, *“has continued to be an essential resource to our users and students studying this period of Nigeria’s history*.” **\[5.1\]** Visitors were not the only ones who benefitted from Egbunike as curator; the artists themselves have shared the positive impacts of their involvement in the exhibition. Titus Agbara writes how this experience changed his practice as an impressionist oil painter: *“Louisa’s vision in curating the legacy of Biafra exhibition has widened my scope of study, reflecting to where it all began as in reminiscing on the very place of our origin…I confess my inner\-self.  Now my expression in both art and emotion is boldly tackled in any medium without restriction or limitations…To crown it all, it has been a stimulus to other Biafra related subjects, which have been under the carpet due to fear of the unknown, politically and socially.  The bold representations and outcry geared up by the curator has been an emancipation to others.”*  **\[5.4\]**  The exhibition has helped artist Imoesi Imhonigie reach a larger audience “ *as people from all over the world have seen the exhibition and \[he has\] been contacted through \[his\] social media outfit by lots of art lovers who saw the exhibition, and who want to know more about \[him\] and \[his\] art”* **\[5.4\]** whereas for ceramicist and painter, Toni Ndikanwu, being involved has been a “ *revelation* *in terms of the amount of information that came out of the process*” and cites Egbunike for helping him clarify his focus on how to portray the conflict. **\[5.4\]**  Writing on behalf of members of NASUK \(Nigeria Art Society UK\), the founder describes how Egbunike’s research “ *created a space for dialogue, combating the silence around the war*” and “ *generating understanding and tolerance*” within the NASUK collective as well as the wider Nigerian community. **\[5.4\]** 

 Egbunike’s documentary, *In the Shadow of Biafra,* reveals poignant, sometimes repressed, recollections of the conflict through highlighted conversations, including an interview with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.  Adichie speaks to the audience, reminding us “ *we must remember, and we must remember with dignity, the people who died.  We must remember what they stood for and we must give up its value and its due because these are the people who were standing up for justice.*” **\[3.5 film timestamp 1:10:17\]** 

 **Memorialisation and raising awareness across different generations and ethnicities** 

 Egbunike’s approach to the Nigeria\-Biafra conflict breaks away from the dominant discourse which focusses on the overt political dimensions of the war. Instead, in choosing to portray the conflict through the voices of writers and artists, she has been able to generate a conversation about how the war is remembered, using the arts as a mode of exploration and healing.  Some of the visitors to the exhibition shared their reactions **\[5.3\]** to the multi\-media on display: 

 *“Memories rushed back as if they happened some months ago…”* 

 *“Beautiful work and collection.  Let us not forget.”* 

 *“Thanks for the reminders and education offered by this exhibition…Biafra has affected the DNA of the Igbos and we will carry its memories and lessons forever.  Perhaps you have helped others understand.”* 

 *“I was in the Biafran story.  I was 7 years old when the war began.  We suffered.  I came here \[to the exhibition\] with my son who has been empowered and enlightened more on his mother’s experience as a child.”* 

 *“I am speechless by the history I never knew, the beauty and pain in the art.”* 

 *“Eye opening, beautifully evocative and made me think of parallels to Ireland \(civil war, famine, British rule\).”* 

 *“I feel inspired even as a South Asian Bengali to document my own history and use of colonial strategies….”* 

 *“Very beautiful and well put together exhibition.  As someone whose father lost two brothers and a cousin whose grandfather fought for Biafra, I feel as though these works can create the correct dialogue to heal the wounds of the past and make sure we as Nigerians don’t make the same mistake again.”* 

 Filmgoers of varying ages who attended the premiere were asked to share how they had been inspired to think differently about Biafra and its broader meaning through feedback cards. From the 73 responses of the 148 attendees, a Dutch\-Ghanaian student of African politics \(aged 18\-24\) commented on the “ *distance between these happenings*” and himself and how, “ *when studying and/or reading about things, you forget the actual people behind it*.”  **\[5.5\]**  Another attendee \(aged 40\-60\) shared their before and after thoughts on how the documentary altered their perception of the conflict from “ *I don’t know enough about Biafra, the context in which the Biafran war came about, or its legacy*” to “ *I understand it more now as a utopian vision and a response to injustice and a chapter in Nigerian history which hasn’t ended*…” **\[5.5\]** 

 Furthermore, Egbunike’s research has also contributed to the commemoration of the Biafran war through theatre. Over the years, Nigerian playwright Inua Ellams and Egbunike have conversed about the war and how it has been engaged with privately rather than publicly, which culminated in Ellams being interviewed by Egbunike for *In The Shadow of Biafra.*   Egbunike was invited by Ellams to consult on his adaptation of Chekhov’s play, *Three Sisters*, set in Biafra, which premiered at the National Theatre in December 2019. Ellams drew on Egbunike’s expertise on Igbo culture to help construct and develop the play’s socio\-cultural setting. Based on this engagement, Ellams credits Egbunike as having been “ *extensively important to staging Three Sisters.*” **\[5.6\]** 

 Reviewing 'Legacies of Biafra' for *Africa Arts,* Will Rea reflects that the exhibition, “ *in its movement backward and forward across time and between despair and hope, shows the way in which an intergenerational dialogue has developed that rethinking—and stands not only as legacy, but also as testament*.” **\[5.7\]** Together, the film and the exhibition highlight the importance of the arts in documenting and exposing conflict; Egbunike’s contribution has foregrounded the role of the creative arts in mediating public awareness and collective memory.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 This case study reports participatory research that uses archives, personal stories and community engagement to create powerful connections between children and young people of the past and present in Manchester and Salford. Participants describe the profound effects of involvement in projects where the production of new digital resources, films and exhibitions have enriched the public’s understanding of childhood and youth histories and had long\-term legacies for cultural heritage, youth partnerships and local communities in Greater Manchester. *Passions of Youth* has been commended by The National Archives. Its methods have inspired further projects that have made emotional reconnections between Mancunians and the Swiss foster families that took them in after the Second World War.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Tebbutt’s research focuses on gender and the everyday lives of working\-class people. It articulates the experiences and perspectives of disenfranchised groups and individuals and explores the relationships between family and community **\[1\]**. Investigations of the complex intersection of culture and memory form the basis of community engagement and heritage activities. Research has contested the narrowness of narratives about childhood and the teen years by challenging dominant stereotypes of ‘youth in trouble’ and ‘youth as trouble’. Her work has contributed an important historical dimension to current research in sociology and cultural studies, whose focus in recent years has shifted towards the ‘ordinary’ young **\[2\].** This emphasis on ‘ordinary’ youth has opened up new historical perspectives on the lives of young people by exploring their anxieties and emotions **\[3\]** while highlighting the voices and opinions of marginalised youth, especially in relation to their leisure experiences. 

 Inspired by ideas from the history of emotions, Tebbutt has delivered a novel interpretation of children’s voices during the First World War, examining, in particular, the largely ignored power dynamics affecting young people’s peer and cross\-generational relations among silent cinema audiences and raising questions subsequently applied in the *Returning Home* project **\[4\].** Her article on borstal inmates in the 1930s addresses the humiliation, fear and helplessness experienced by borstal boys and rejects notions of ‘troublesome’ youth while emphasising young people’s immense creative potential instead **\[5\].** Tebbutt’s research has delivered a new understanding of ‘ordinary’ and ‘everyday’ experiences of youth, the relationship between class and adolescent transitions, and the subtleties of youth agency **\[2\]**. It demonstrates the importance of examining how feelings and emotions were expressed through young people’s recreational experiences and the significance of leisure more broadly to adolescent transitions in the past and in the present. The value of these insights was recognised by AHRC follow\-on funding for the *Passions of Youth* community engagement project, which built on research into the relationship between leisure experiences and the emerging identities of adolescent young men. This project used the history and heritage of leisure as a way of breaking down educational and cultural barriers with seldom\-heard working\-class teenagers. 

 Tebbutt’s research, community partnerships and collaborative engagement have been mutually reinforcing. Published work on BBC youth broadcasting in the 1930s and 1940s, which explored a largely ignored aspect of young people’s relationship with broadcasting history and the importance of their contribution to democratic debate **\[6\]**, was influenced by the emphasis on youth empowerment that characterised her community engagement work on *Passions.* Research on the interplay between adult perceptions and the perspectives of childhood, based on qualitative evidence, such as diaries, letters, autobiographies and oral histories **\[1 and 2\],** informs her most recent community engagement project. *Returning Home* enables participants to share deeply emotional childhood experiences about displacement from family after the Second World War. It uses creative approaches and archive materials to open up new ways of thinking about shared experiences of childhood.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Empowerment through history and heritage** 

 Following the publication of her AHRC\-funded monograph \[G1\] on leisure and identity **\[2\],** Tebbutt was awarded further AHRC funding \[G3\] in 2014 to develop community engagement activities around the ideas in the book and this led to the creation of *The Passions of Youth* \( *POY*\) series of projects **\[A\]**. *POY* worked with 37 working\-class young men in their teens from Manchester and Salford who had never previously engaged with heritage, history or higher education. Project partners were Collyhurst and Moston Lads Club, FC United of Manchester, Salford Youth Hub: Young Fathers, and basketballers at The Factory Youth Zone. *POY* increased the young men’s understanding of local leisure traditions by using these leisure enthusiasms and expertise as a medium through which to explore their history via archival research, storytelling, drama and filmmaking. The project was supported by historians, youth workers, curators and archivists **\[B\]**. The young men received training in creative activities, visited heritage venues and shared their films with local communities in public screenings at the Miners’ Community Arts and Community Centre \[audience c.100\]; at FC United football club \[audience c.80\-100\] and during the Manchester Histories Festival \[audience c.50\]. The Lord Mayor of Manchester presented the participants with university certificates. Independent project evaluation highlighted new learning, increased confidence and, for some, heightened educational aspirations. David, a Salford ‘Young Father’, described *POY* as an ‘eye opener’, finding that even with dyslexia, he could think about going to university: ‘Learning that you’re not the only person that needs support… it gives you the chance to be the person that you want to be’ **\[C\].** For a young boxer who became a teaching assistant in a local school, taking part opened up ‘a whole new circle’ for him and it turned out to be ‘the beginning of something’ for another participant, who went on to become a personal trainer **\[D\].** 

  

 *POY  extended the institutional and cultural networks of participating organisations. Project workers supported funding applications at Collyhurst and Moston Lads Club that led to the refurbishment of a community room for learning activities. The project also facilitated professional introductions that resulted in new initiatives with a theatre company, a documentary film maker and participation in programmes against knife crime and for railway safety. The club manager described *POY* as an immense *‘*confidence booster’, unlocking another world for himself, for the boys who took part and for others who saw their success: *‘*The kids round here, they get told to do one thing and they stick to it – be a plumber or a joiner… It’s opened their eyes and they won’t settle for what people say they should do. Now they can choose whatever they want to do’ **\[D\]**. Parents described the project as *‘*fantastic’; ‘Such a well needed experience for North Manchester Youth’; ‘Lads should be very proud of what they’ve achieved. Especially proud of my son Callum’; ‘it has shown opportunities to others which can help develop themselves in the ring as well as life leading to success’; ‘Engaging, Inspiring films. Authentic voices, great characters, loved it\!’ **\[C\].** 

 *POY* has created an impact beyond its Manchester and Salford roots and its approach has influenced other projects and received national and international recognition. Films made as part of the project have been used as part of youth studies provision in England and on undergraduate courses in Norway: *‘*great supplementary material to show the complexities of being young today’ **\[D\].** Norwegian students sent feedback to the boxers: *‘*Hey guys, Great movie, looks like a good community. Maybe one day you will inspire other lads’; ‘keep on working to achieve your dreams’ **\[D\].** *POY’*s participatory models have influenced other funded projects and partnerships in universities, the voluntary sector and schools. The approach provided ‘the underpinnings to a number of high\-profile Manchester Centre for Youth Studies projects’, including an ESRC/AHRC\-funded \(GBP117,000\) knowledge transfer partnership project \(KTP\). *‘*The influence of the Passions project in the development of the KTP cannot be underestimated’ **\[E\]**. It was *‘*integral to the development’ of a GBP450,0000 Comic Relief project on girls and gangs, which ‘mimicked’ Passions’ methodologies and partnerships **\[E\]**. It was a template for schools’ project work on the AHRC *Voices of War and Peace* project \(Tebbutt was a Co\-I\). In 2019, the project was shortlisted for an Emerald Publishing ‘International Impact Award’ for engaged research that meets ‘an important social need’ **\[F\].** The National Archives profiled *POY* as an exemplar of higher education projects that use archives to engage with the wider community and the history and heritage of local boxing clubs that appear in the project are featured permanently on *Visit Manchester*, Greater Manchester’s official tourism site **\[F\]**. 

 **Inspiring new cultural production** 

 In 2014, Tebbutt used her experiences of working on *POY* to co\-produce a documentary film, *Forever Young,* for the AHRC and British Academy\-funded *Being Human* festival. 

 Intergenerational themes were combined with footage from the North West Film Archive \(NWFA\) and contemporary oral testimony to create an impressionistic portrayal of teenage leisure lives from the 1940s to the 2000s. Screened in public and academic venues in Manchester, Liverpool and Preston, *Forever Young* has been used as a teaching aid on youth studies, history and fashion courses at Manchester Metropolitan. Screened internationally at the University of British Columbia, an audience member described the film as *‘*a beautiful way of sharing people’s stories as well as broader themes of memory, youth and time’ **\[G\].** Visual commemoration of youth experiences continued in 2018, when Tebbutt worked with the artist Jacqueline Butler to co\-curate an exhibition of photos of German children and women during WW1 by the German photographer Kathe Buchler. The exhibition took place at Manchester Metropolitan’s Grosvenor Gallery, as part of a UK tour organised with the Museum für Photographie, Braunschweig and AHRC WW1 engagement centres at the Universities of Birmingham and Hertfordshire. The exhibition raised questions about the representation of children’s wartime experiences. Visitors described it as *‘*emotionally moving’. ‘For me it was the pictures of the children. How they were, at the same time, aware of the war and unaware of the war…how war has become the “new normal” for them’; ‘Very powerful images which really make you think about WW1 and how people lived and worked at a much younger age’ **\[H\].** 

 **Connecting the generations** 

 In 2014\-15, Tebbutt’s community partnership expertise led to the award of *Creating Our Future Histories* \( *COFH*\), a 9\-month AHRC\-funded \[G2\] postgraduate training programme with the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement \(NCCPE\), the People’s History Museum, the Manchester Histories charity and seven local community groups. *COFH* was established to change the way in which early career researchers are taught about public and community engagement through the design and delivery of a unique training experience which matched 16 exceptional postgraduate researchers recruited from a national field with Manchester\-based community groups. Independent evaluation highlighted *COFH*’s success in breaking down barriers, creating sustainable relationships and increasing well\-being. The training enhanced a sense of belonging and identification with Manchester’s history, culture and heritage; increased awareness of community organisations’ purpose; and improved understanding of connections between research, community engagement and the public **\[I\].** 

 Lessons learned in *COFH* informed the latest *Passions* project, *Returning Home*, which used participatory heritage approaches, visual records and memory work with adults from Manchester and Salford who as ‘delicate children’ were sent by the Swiss Red Cross to stay with Swiss foster families for three months after the Second World War. Inspired by unique archive film of the children’s return to Manchester in 1948, it is a collaboration led by Tebbutt with the NWFA and the same team of experts \(creative lead Sue Reddish and community film\-maker Jim Dalziel\) that worked on *POY*. On the 70th anniversary of the initiative, the NWFA, Granada Reports \(28/3/2018\) and the *Manchester Evening News* \(23/6/2018\) used an excerpt of the archive footage to make a coordinated appeal for adults to come forward who had been sent to Switzerland as children. 80 of these ‘returners’ and their relatives made contact and subsequently attended an emotional screening of the whole film. *‘*For us to see moving images of our mum, her sister and our grandparents from 70 years ago was truly amazing and will be treasured’; ‘So many hearts broken and not until you were old enough to know these feelings yourself can you understand’; ‘I have listened to my dad over the years... but it became more real having attended the event and learning more about that time in my dad's life’ **\[J\]**. 25 ‘returners’ became involved with the *Returning Home* engagement project, which was presented in 2019 at the annual congress of the International Federation of Film Archives \(Lausanne, c.100 viewers\) and at the Society for the History of Children and Youth conference \(Sydney, c.40 attendees\) **\[J\].** Covid\-19 lockdown made face\-to\-face group work and interviews impossible and forced the project online. This slowed the pace of engagement, giving more time for self\-reflection and allowing returners’ stories, several collaboratively pieced together from text messages, emails and phone calls, to illustrate the ambivalence some felt about being sent away. At a national online workshop, ‘Doing public history in lockdown’ for the Raphael Samuel History Centre, \(c.70 participants\), a Dutch public historian described this work as ‘a compelling example of the benefits of “slow” public history’ **\[J\].** Lockdown also provided an opportunity to collate a rich online resource of written material and films, including a 30\-minute documentary, *Returners’ Stories,* the first to commemorate this Swiss\-British initiative, available in the Viewing Pods at Manchester Central Library and on the Manchester Histories website. It featured on BBC North West Tonight \(2/9/2020\) and BBC Radio Manchester \(20/9/2020\) and was live\-streamed at Manchester Histories Digifest \(5/9/2020\) on the 50th anniversary of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act \(3,000\+ online viewers\) **\[J\].** The website, which the Swiss Red Cross has described as ‘excellent’, is a hub for returners’ relatives across the world \(2,122 visitors and 5,593 views in 2020\). A returner’s daughter emailed from Australia: ‘The website is wonderful\! Sitting here at work with tears in my eyes – but smiling – it's really lovely and I know Mum will be thrilled when I show her this weekend. It's brilliant to think that what Mum has talked about her whole life is actually something that all the family can now “Google” and share – amazing\!’ Returners have described how much they valued *Returning Home* during lockdown, when separated from loved ones. It ‘has been like therapy for me, it really has, I’ve had this at the back of my head, locked away for years and years … it’s ...as though this bubble has burst and … brought all these memories back... it’s made me feel happy’. Individuals’ Red Cross cards from 1948 located in the Swiss Federal Archives have resonated powerfully with returners and their families: ‘It is history coming to life and will be a wonderful addition to the record of my Mum’s life’ \(of a participant who sadly died from Covid in 2020\) **\[J\]**. To some, the project has brought a different understanding of childhood feelings at being sent away, transforming their view of themselves. One returner, the son of a poor single parent, came close to tears at seeing himself described as ‘reserved’, ‘affectionate’ and ‘suitable for a good home’. Having puzzled for over 70 years why he’d been placed at a children’s hostel rather than with a family, the description challenged a lifelong sense of stigma. His daughter emailed ‘The whole family is thrilled: it cheered us up, so much, we’ve all had a little cry’. *Returning Home* is now entering a new phase through a collaboration with the Swiss Red Cross on its 2021 themes of ‘family unity’ and ‘health support’. It is allowing British families to take up their own research by connecting them with records in Switzerland and the Red Cross’s Tracing Service which is helping ‘returners’ and their relatives search for the Swiss foster families who welcomed them in 1948. As one relative puts it, this provides an important opportunity ‘to say thank you for their hospitality and kindness in looking after my mum, all those years ago’ **\[J\].**

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Learning a foreign language has recognised benefits for cognitive, social and economic development. However, learners can be demotivated by poorly developed listening and reading skills that teachers often lack the skills and confidence to improve. Addressing those issues, Suzanne Graham’s research has changed the teaching and assessment of foreign languages from primary through to tertiary education, reaching over 1,500,000 learners and their teachers in over 140 countries. Her findings have brought about improvements to and changes in teachers’ subject knowledge and classroom practice for developing learners’ comprehension skills, as well as for developing their motivation and confidence for language study. Her research has thus made a wide\-reaching and very significant contribution to addressing the challenges of low motivation for and competence in foreign language learning. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Long\-term research by Graham has led to internationally significant findings on the relationship between three key factors for students’ success, enjoyment and motivation in learning a modern foreign language \(MFL\). These are metacognition \(understanding their own learning\), self\-regulation \(knowing how to improve their learning\); and self\-efficacy \(believing in their ability to complete tasks successfully\). Graham’s work has demonstrated that these factors are also important in enabling students to understand authentic listening and reading materials, which, in turn, motivate through the cultural insights and interest they stimulate. It has also shown that these factors act in synergy and influence student decisions about whether to continue with MFL study \[Section 3, ref 1\]. Furthermore, the research has demonstrated through funded classroom interventions the teaching approaches that lead to improved self\-regulation, self\-efficacy and comprehension \[Section 3, refs 2 and 5\]. 

##  Teachers lack confidence and skill in developing comprehension and motivation 

 Following Graham’s insights into how to improve students’ confidence and comprehension skills, more recent work since 2014 has focused on how to change language teaching strategies and classroom practices accordingly. She conducted the only existing large\-scale study of classroom practice for teaching listening comprehension, gathering questionnaire, interview and observational data from language teachers in six regions in England. Funded by the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation \(GBP70,004\), the research showed that teachers lacked confidence and skill in how to develop students’ listening proficiency and confidence \[ref 3\], findings that echo concerns voiced in countries such as Japan and China. Next, an ESRC follow\-on study \(GBP99,985\) demonstrated that engagement with research about how to improve listening skills had a statistically significant, positive impact on teachers’ pedagogical understanding. It also provided a framework for future Nuffield Foundation funded teacher development initiatives and grassroots collaborations. 

##  Importance of sense of progress at the primary–secondary school transition 

 Subsequent Nuffield Foundation funded research \(GBP139,585\) investigated changes in attainment and motivation when students move from primary to secondary school in 10 schools in England, in the only externally funded longitudinal study of primary MFL in England since 2010. Findings highlighted that primary school teaching approaches which made learners aware that they were making progress and growing in competence were crucial for motivation across transition \[ref 4\]. 

##  Developing comprehension, confidence and intrinsic motivation through authentic texts 

 The research funded by the Nuffield Foundation also showed that learners lacked confidence in understanding French and using it for authentic communication; for example, being able to read the kind of text that might interest a French teenager. These issues were thus explored in a second Nuffield\-funded study \(led by Oxford University’s Department of Education, with 878 learners in 36 schools\). The largest funded England\-based study of secondary school MFL for around 20 years, it confirmed the value of using authentic texts to boost confidence and interest when learners move from primary to secondary school, and clarified the teaching approaches that can facilitate that \[ref 5\]. Graham led the strand of the research \(in 13 schools\) that showed that teaching strategies focusing on self\-regulation and comprehension were vital for improving learners’ self\-efficacy in reading about aspects of French\-speaking culture, such as music. The value of using authentic texts such as these was further tested with 586 learners in 15 secondary schools, as part of a GBP3,230,977 AHRC grant \(led by Oxford\). For the first time, Graham showed that MFL learners’ creativity and vocabulary were enhanced when they studied texts such as poems and when the teaching focused on personal and emotional engagement \[ref 6\]. 

 Overall, Graham’s research has established the importance of nurturing learners’ motivation for language learning by enhancing their self\-efficacy, metacognition, self\-regulation and sense of progress in comprehending authentic and culturally rich materials. These are areas in which teachers often lack confidence and skill themselves. The findings are important because they provide clear guidelines on how to develop teachers’ pedagogy and practice, as well as the examination and assessment frameworks needed to facilitate them. As a result, they have led to wide\-reaching and significant changes in those areas in England and around 140 other countries.

#  3. References to the research 

 **2\* threshold:** The research constitutes a body of work unique in its focus on self\-efficacy for language comprehension among learners and teachers across all phases of education, demonstrating for the first time how it can be improved through research\-informed instruction and a focus on personal engagement and progression. The work includes the only externally funded longitudinal study of primary MFL in England since 2010, and the two largest funded investigations for 20 years of reading comprehension for secondary MFL learners, across approximately 1,500 learners in total. These studies have applied appropriate longitudinal and mixed\-method research designs, and rigorous data collection and analysis, including multi\-level modelling. They have thus contributed significantly to the advancement of knowledge and in turn to changes in policy and practice. All of the above is reflected in the work’s funding through competitive, peer\-reviewed grants, and publication in peer\-reviewed international outlets.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Languages play an important role in enriching education and advancing learners’ cognitive and social development. Learners can, however, be demotivated by poorly developed comprehension skills that teachers often lack the skills to improve. Bringing about changes in teacher classroom practice and confidence is thus a fundamental element in achieving improvements in learner motivation and competence, across all stages of education and in all countries. Graham’s research has led to significant changes in language education. Her findings on student confidence, motivation and outcomes for language comprehension have been used to make changes to England’s frameworks for A\-level and GCSE exams in MFL, in turn prompting changes in classroom practice. Additionally, her research on teacher confidence, understanding and classroom practice has influenced both teacher training and the development of materials used in primary, secondary and tertiary education in 140 countries. As a result, teachers are more confident and skilful, and are better placed to improve student motivation and learning outcomes. 

##  Changing national exam and subject content frameworks 

 Acknowledging the importance of Graham’s research on listening and self\-regulation as an “invaluable contribution to curriculum and assessment reform”, in 2014/15 a Department for Education \(DfE\) advisor rewrote the exam and subject content for MFL GCSE and A\-Level. The exams now place greater emphasis on requiring students to understand more authentic spoken language. These changes affect the majority of state secondary schools in England, impacting around 300,000 students for GCSE and 18,000 for A level annually. Changes were made in the knowledge that assessment frameworks shape classroom practice. The DfE advisor comments that “Higher expectations of the competences required in the new specification should act as drivers of such change” \[Section 5, source 1\]. 

 For A\-level, Graham provided “authoritative” evidence\-based advice to the MFL A\-level Content Advisory Board \(ALCAB\) in 2014. As a result, her 2004 article \[Section 3, ref 1\] was cited as supporting evidence in ALCAB’s final recommendations, emphasising the need for motivating and authentic content \[source 1\]. As a result, the subsequent “new assessment requirements have been influenced by the body of research evidence from Professor Graham” \[source 1\]. 

##  Resulting changes to teacher training and practice 

###  \(i\) Listening comprehension 

 The revised exam requirements made greater demands, however, on the classroom skills of MFL teachers in England, whose confidence and subject knowledge for teaching listening is often under\-developed \[ref 3\]. That is also true in other countries. To address this and support teachers, Graham’s work has provided research\-informed materials and training for listening comprehension which have shaped initial teacher education \(ITE\) programmes and continued professional development \(CPD\) in England and beyond. 

 Web\-based materials \( [pdcinmfl.com/](http://pdcinmfl.com/)\) were developed to show classroom applications of the listening research \[refs 2 and 3\]. By mid\-2020, there had been over 70,000 hits from 140\+ countries across five continents \[source 2\]. The site has been described by a lead practitioner as  [“a highly positive development for language teachers](http://www.rachelhawkes.com/PandT/Assessment_2015/Assess2015.php)” and by ITE tutors as “influential” \[source 2\]. Using the site and its underpinning research, ITE courses in England have moved away from training teachers to simply test comprehension; they now follow a principled pedagogy for developing listening and learner confidence. The site underpins the ITE MFL course at Reading \(led by Graham, educating around 175 teachers since 2013\) and ITE in other universities, ranging from Portsmouth and Sussex in the south, to the Midlands and Yorkshire \[source 2\]. Trainee teachers have reported an “improved understanding of … the difficulties learners face”, resulting in changes in teaching so that “students' level of anxiety around listening has decreased, their motivation has increased and now both instructor and students are more confident when carrying out listening activities”. 

 Beyond the UK, Graham’s research on effective listening pedagogy has underpinned textbooks for teaching English in Brazil, used by over c.1,000,000 schoolteachers and learners, and one of the few textbooks available for Portuguese \[source 4\]. 

 Graham’s research on self\-efficacy when applied to listening tasks also underpins training given by a leading teacher CPD provider, influencing the work of 8,000\+ language teachers in five continents \[source 3\]. The research has also influenced teacher development in 12 schools in Hong Kong through another CPD provider, affecting 1200\+ learners \[source 3\]. 

 The impact of the research also extends to tertiary education, leading to improved practice and learning outcomes around the world. For example, in Japan the work has led to improvements in the instruction of hundreds of university English language teachers on listening skills, the listening proficiency of their learners, and the development of listening materials in that country \[source 5\]. 

###  \(ii\) Improving motivation by changing teaching approaches to include authentic material 

 Graham’s early research \[refs 1 and 2\] established the importance of enabling learners to understand more authentic, and hence more interesting materials in the foreign language, for encouraging them to continue language study. Subsequently, in 2016–18, a further study \[ref 5\], in collaboration with 13 schools in England, investigated changes in teaching practice for the adoption of authentic texts. This combined empirical research with a positive impact through changed teaching practices across year groups and languages. It resulted in a positive learning experience and increased learner confidence \[source 6\]. The value of using authentic texts was next shown in the Creative Multilingualism project, where the approaches implemented led to significant gains in vocabulary and general creativity for 586 learners in 15 schools in England. They also gave teachers “the courage to try out more ambitious things” in the classroom \[ref 6; source 6\]. 

 As a result, the teaching approaches in these two successful school collaborations were then rolled out on a national basis, forming part of the National Centre of Excellence for Language Pedagogy \(NCELP\), funded by the DfE. NCELP’s work has drawn heavily on Graham’s research on self\-efficacy, in order to improve MFL uptake at GCSE \[source 7\]. Graham developed and delivered training, materials and toolkits for NCELP based on the projects funded by the Nuffield Foundation and the AHRC, reaching approximately 22,000 learners in all 45 NCELP schools across England, and influencing NCELP’s Schemes of Work \[source 7\]. The materials were then used at further national practitioner events, where students and tutors from 11 teacher training and higher education institutions from across England improved their understanding of how to use authentic texts, leading to changed practice \[source 7\]. As a result of all these activities, teachers are better equipped to provide intrinsically motivating classroom experiences. 

##  Changing national and international pedagogy for primary–secondary school transition 

 Graham’s research on the transition from primary to secondary school established the importance of giving learners a sense of continuing progress in MFL. Recognising the value of that research for the classroom, the DfE awarded her GBP107,000 in 2015/16 to provide teachers in the Thames Valley with training that was based on it \[ref 4\]. The aim was to ensure that teachers were equipped with the necessary skills and tools for developing learners’ communication and comprehension, across the two school phases. Working with 80\+ schools \(affecting over 8,000 learners\), Graham trained teachers in classroom practices developed from the research cited in refs 3 and 4. Reports to the DfE show statistically significant impact on teachers, who commented that the training not only improved their own confidence and pedagogical understanding, but also “vastly increased the practice and motivation of the pupils” \[source 8\]. In 2020, Graham’s findings on sense of progress and motivation similarly improved the pedagogical understanding of 3,333 teachers, from over 100 countries, through a MOOC developed with the Universities of Southampton and Essex. An end of MOOC survey showed increased understanding of motivation \(76.6%\) and the intention to adapt practice as a result \(83.4%\) \[source 8\]. 

 Changes to classroom resources for use across primary and secondary education have also arisen from the research. After sharing findings on the importance of students having a sense of progress, and the motivation that resulted from that \[ref 4\], Graham was named as a “leading primary language research expert” by the Goethe Institute. It invited her to join *The Language Magician*, an EU project to develop an online game underpinned by her research. The game has been used to provide diagnostic assessment for 20,258 learners in 838 schools across 94\+ countries in seven continents since 2018, including 25 of 28 EU countries \[source 9\]. The game’s website shows a reach of more than 2,000,000 hits. Primary teachers from 400 schools in England have been trained to assess learners with the game, and it is used in around 400 towns and cities across the UK. It is embedded as a core curriculum resource \(in Spain, Italy and Germany\) and teacher training module \(used by the Spanish Ministry of Education, and the Tenerife Grand Canaria Regional Educational Authority\). In Tenerife the game is used to assess all European languages, including among migrant learners. Around 90% of 3,437 learners in England, Italy, Spain and Germany who used the game said it gave them useful information about their progress and that they found it motivating. Its high educational value was recognised through the award of “Erasmus\+ Innovation Project 2018”. Then, in 2020, the European Commission awarded it the title of “success story”, a term reserved for “projects that have distinguished themselves by their impact, contribution to policy\-making, innovative results and/or creative approach, and can be a source of inspiration for others” \[all source 9\]. 

 Without appropriate instruction, it is easy for language learners to become demotivated. Graham’s research has led to global changes in teachers’ subject knowledge and classroom practice for developing learners’ comprehension skills, critical factors for improving confidence and motivation for language study. It has also influenced policy for assessment. Reaching over 140 countries, from primary to higher education, this work addresses the challenges of low confidence, competence and motivation in MFL meaning that learners can gain significant benefit from the associated cognitive and social development gained from learning an additional language.

 Figure 1. Plunge in situ 





Throughout his research, Pinsky uses his art pieces to bring awareness of climate change to the general public, promoting positive behaviour change and supporting education. Pieces such as *Plunge* **\(R1a, b\)** or *In Transit* **\(R2\)  visualise encroaching climate issues; rising sea levels and non\-fiscal costs of transport modes respectively. *Pollution Pods* **\(R3\)** builds on his experience with climate activism art and collaborative studies to create an art piece optimised for climate psychology and advocating for behaviour change in his audience. 

 The *Pollution Pods* were commissioned by and developed with The Norwegian University of Science and Technology \(NTNU\) as part of a multidisciplinary investigation of environmental psychology, visual art and communication around climate concerns. Based on findings from Phase 1 of the project, which collected data on the mechanisms prior artwork employed to illicit changes in emotion and opinion **\(R4\)**, Pinsky was challenged with designing an art piece which aligned with the principles set forth by the study: 



-  *Exposure to immersive activism art increased intentions to engage in actions to address pollution and climate change;* 

-  *Sadness, helplessness and anger were strongest emotions impacting intentions to act;* 

-  Figure 3. Model of relationship between climate psychology and art 

*Ascription of responsibility was strongest cognition impacting intentions to act.* **\(R5\)** 

 Pinsky decided to recreate the pollution in five chosen locations representing the least toxic to the most toxic in air quality: Tautra, Norway; London, United Kingdom; San Paolo, Brazil; Beijing, China and New Dehli, India. These locations were chosen to represent how air pollution presents significant risk to the health of local and adjacent populations and to demonstrate the unique circumstances facing the Global South as they wrestle with the causes and consequences of toxic air. The domes are interconnected to illustrate that air pollution is a global problem. 

 When initial recreations proved too toxic for visitors even for short exposure durations, Pinsky reached out to International Flavours and Fragrances \(IFF\) to mix unique cocktails of perfumes, produced by perfumers from the chosen locales. The final concoctions emulated the locations relative presence of ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide within the interconnected pods solely through smell. By combining the perfumes with heaters, humidifiers and misters Pinsky was able to simulate the atmospheres of the locations. The pods evoke a physical and psychological reaction, but the atmospheres are non\-toxic. 

 The materials and design were chosen to avoid contributing to air pollution. Light\-weight reclaimed Norwegian pine forms the frame of the domes and the construction of the tessellated shapes is simple for local staff to construct while the exhibition is touring, ensuring that the pods can reach as many places/people as possible and reducing the installations as well as visitors’ carbon footprint. **\(R6\)**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1. Changing climate psychology, awareness and education.** 

 
In April 2019, as Pinsky was installing *Pollution Pods* in Vancouver, Canada commissioned as part of the annual TED conference, the Mayor of London announced that 2 million Londoners – including 400,000 children – were living in areas exceeding legal air pollutant metrics **\(S1\).** The global health implications of air pollution continue to require urgent and drastic action from individuals and governments. 

 In surveys of audiences after they experienced *Pollution Pods,* many participants reported an “ *awareness of the environmental consequences of their action, their willingness to take responsibility for their consequences,* and *belief in the relevance of environmental problems for daily life.*” **\(S2\)** 

 


 Figure 4. Visitor enjoys Norwegian air at Somerset House, London 

Pinsky’s *Pollution Pods* succeed in provoking the emotions and cognitions which are most likely to incite positive behavioural change in audiences and, in turn, the global atmosphere. The effectiveness of Pinsky’s approach was recognised in the 2019 textbook *Public/community health and nursing practice: caring for populations* as an aid to help nursing students comprehend the dangers of public health hazards like toxic air and convey them to patients **\(S3\).** 

 Figure 5. Pollution Pods exhibit at TED 

*Pollution Pods* pairs well with educational events such as the King’s College seminar series which was funded by the Medical Research Council **\(S4\)** and the events surrounding the UN Youth Climate Summit New York City, 2019. Pinsky continues to be involved with TED Talks, exhibiting at the annual 2019 conference and delivering a talk at TEDx Freiburg. **\(S5\)** 

 **2. Global Collaboration for Global Problems** 

 As illustrated by the inter\-connected pods, Pinsky emphasises the need for global participation in solutions to climate change. From the inception of the project, Pinsky worked closely with international institutions and corporations: NTNU, IFF, AirLabs, Hubs and the Norwegian Institute for Clean Air. In particular, his commission for IFF and their perfumers brought new opportunity for expert perfumers from those areas to showcase their craft and to participate in political art. 

 Pinsky’s commitment to promoting international responsibility for air pollution has translated into a relevance which extends beyond language barriers, demonstrated by international coverage in English, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Italian, Luxembourgish, Portuguese, Japanese, Swiss, Czech, Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Indonesian. The sustained, global interest in *Pollution Pods* results in sustained interest in air pollution and access to commentary about the project is crucial to reaching people who will not have the opportunity to view the pods in person. 

 Since the initial exhibition in Norway, *Pollution Pods* has toured to eight different countries and over 30,000 visitors have experienced the sensations of the pods **\(S6\).** In each new location, the installation attracts media coverage and engagement. **\(S7a, b, c, d, e\)**

*Pollution Pods* has also reached prominent health and climate activist spokespeople, such as Greta Thunberg and Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus **,** Director\-General of WHO. Between those two figures alone, 6.3 million Twitter followers were engaged specifically with the challenges and consequences of air pollution in the context of wider climate and health concerns. *Pollution Pods* even featured on an episode of Daily Planet, a scientific news show aired on and produced by Discovery Channel Canada. 

 **3. Engagement with policy makers** 

 Figure 9. The pods in Madrid 

*Pollution Pods* was exhibited December 2019 in Madrid, Spain concurrent to the COP25 UN Climate Change Conference.  It was officially endorsed and opened by Minister for the Ecological Transition Spain Teresa Ribera, WHO Director Dr Maria Neira, and the Deputy\-Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Ovais Sarmad. **\(S8\)** 

 During this time, the pods hosted members of the public and delegates from the conference. *Pollution Pods* was especially topical to the delegates, as the conference discussed the parameters of the 2015 Paris Agreement and emission targets. 

 The pods were exhibited as part of Manchester’s 2019 Clean Air Week, a collaborative project between local councils, charities and communities to help reduce air pollution in Greater Manchester and alert the public to health hazards. **\(S9\)** 

 **4. Moving forward** 

 As a result of the positive reception and success of *Pollution Pods,* Pinsky is now working with Professor Stephen Holgate, Medical Research Council Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology, to create a response to the dangers of indoor pollution through olfactory art. **\(S10\)**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 As a result of University of Bristol \(UoB\) research, billions of farmed fish annually worldwide have improved welfare at slaughter. UoB was the first to identify and measure welfare problems with slaughter by asphyxiation in air or on ice, or gill cutting and bleed\-out while still conscious; they proceeded to develop proven humane stunning techniques. Their collaborative research with industry has pioneered commercial stunning equipment now used worldwide for salmon and trout and enabled humane mass slaughter with improved productivity and fish quality. Concurrently, the research has led to significant changes in policy worldwide, including the World Organisation for Animal Health \(OIE\) guidelines, RSPCA welfare standards, the Soil Association’s and Naturland’s international organic standards. Affecting a wide range of fish species, these policies all follow UoB’s research by recommending stunning before slaughter. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Pioneering research at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) has led the way in evaluating the welfare of farmed salmon and trout at the time of slaughter. Studies support the view that fish are sentient animals that can feel pain. It has been shown, for instance, that given the choice, fish will access analgesics to alleviate pain. To be considered humane, a killing method must render the fish immediately unconscious, unaware of any pain, and that this condition should persist until death. 

 Research by the UoB group in the early 2000s, led by Dr Kestin, was the first to establish that there was a welfare problem with the then prevalent methods of fish slaughter \[1\]. By monitoring the electrical activity of fish brains, they established that fish take a long time to die with the commercial methods of handling and slaughter used at the time. These included leaving fish to die a slow, painful death in air or in ice slurry, or gill cutting without stunning, which results in fish remaining conscious whilst slowly dying from blood loss \[2\]. 

 The UoB team developed protocols for assessing welfare of fish at the time of slaughter \[3\], focussing on indicators of consciousness, such as respiration, eyes responding to light, checking whether the eyes move with movement of fish \(conscious fish maintain their eyes horizontal when the body is turned, termed ‘righting mechanism’\) and twitching in response to pinching. In experimental work, electroencephalograms provided the gold standard against which to benchmark these methods of assessing consciousness, which are easier to use in a commercial situation. Using these welfare protocols, the researchers found percussive or electrical stunning to be the principal humane methods of slaughter. Electrical stunning also has the potential to reduce handling of conscious fish. From a welfare perspective, electrocution \(which may both stun and kill a fish instantaneously\) is ideal, but there are potential commercial disadvantages in that it can affect flesh quality by causing, for example, blood spots and broken bones. 

 Thus, the body of work not only compared different methods of welfare assessment, handling and slaughter, but also investigated the consequences for the whole fish, its flesh quality and shelf life to ensure acceptability to the aquaculture industry. It was necessary to determine which electrical parameters of the equipment used to electrically stun fish would be effective in terms of fish welfare but without commercial downsides. Systematic experimental studies determined that the duration of stun application, plus the frequency and magnitude of the current, were important for how long trout remained stunned and whether or not they were humanely killed \[4\]. Further work on salmon \[5\] led to a better understanding of the electrical parameters needed to produce unconsciousness \(animals that lose consciousness quickly are unaware of subsequent procedures used to kill them and do not feel pain: hence this is deemed humane\). Follow\-on research on electrical stunning specifically investigated flesh quality, including new species, such as turbot \[6\] and sea bass \[7\]. LINK\-funded research \[iii\] by UoB and Silsoe Livestock Systems Ltd with industrial partners The Co\-operative Group \(CWS\) Ltd, Waitrose Ltd, Ace Aquatec, Kames Fish Farming Ltd, Shetland Halibut Co. Ltd, together with the Humane Slaughter Association and funding from Defra, moved from stunning in fresh water to electrical stunning in sea water of farmed halibut, extending both species and water type. 

 This body of research, along with research conducted in development with a commercial partner, laid the foundation for practical, welfare\-friendly methods of killing the billions of fish \(more than all other food animals\) farmed globally.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Production of the six top species groups of farmed fish was estimated at 48.5 million tonnes in 2018 \(Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\)\)**Footnote:**

 [http://www.fao.org/3/ca9383en/ca9383en.pdf](http://www.fao.org/3/ca9383en/ca9383en.pdf) 
, representing many billions of individuals. These species are grouped as: carps and barbels; tilapias; catfish; salmons, trouts and smelts; freshwater fishes; and marine perch\-like species, which include sea bass and sea bream. Total global production of farmed Atlantic salmon alone, the focus of initial UoB research, is estimated to comprise 200,000,000 fish \(2.5 million tonnes in 2018, \( [FAO](http://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/market-reports/resource-detail/en/c/1189947/)\)\). 

 Research at UoB \(2000 – 2020\) alerted animal welfare charities, government agencies and fish producers to problems with existing slaughter practices within aquaculture fish production. Moreover, the work \[4\-7\] identified practicable solutions to achieving an instantaneous loss of consciousness via electrical stunning which represents a more humane method of slaughter than those previously used. Thanks to the evidence base provided by this work, electrical stunners are now used around the world on salmon, trout, turbot and sea bass \[2\-7\]. The use of stunners on pangasius \(catfish\), sea bream, yellowtail, carp and barramundi is currently under investigation by UoB with industrial partners in an Humane Slaughter Association project \(see below\), thus the work has successfully reached species from five of the six top groups of farmed fish, and beyond. Thanks to the specification of the new humane methods of stunning at slaughter by international standards, awareness of the methods is global, even if they are not always implemented \(e.g. where farms are too small in scale for the equipment to be practical\). Further, the UoB research team has collaborated with a commercial partner, Ace Aquatec, to develop stunning equipment. This, in turn, has opened up new markets and increased staff \(recently doubling in number\) and sales from European, Australian and South American regional offices for Ace Aquatec \[I\]. 

 **Impacts on national and international policy: food and animal welfare standards** 

 To reassure consumers, most food derived from animals, including fish, complies with standards that ensure high standards of hygiene and animal health and welfare. The UK is the EU’s biggest producer of farmed salmon, the focus of earlier UoB research \[2,5\], and is responsible for 163 thousand tonnes of salmon each year \(\~15 million fish\), 90% by volume of total EU production and 8% of the global market. Over 70% of UK salmon producers adopt RSPCA Assured welfare standards, which require certificate holders to ensure good welfare practices at slaughter. These practices reflect the UoB team’s research; Kestin of the UoB group contributed to the RSPCA’s guidelines on fish welfare at slaughter for farmed Atlantic salmon, which were updated in 2018 \[A\] and are still informed by UoB work. The UoB team further influenced retailer standards, opening up the use of electrical stunning to more species investigated by UoB, including trout \[4\] and sea bass \[7\]. For example, Waitrose, the retailer with the greatest market share of fish in the UK \(1.9 million fish/year\), requires that “ *All our farmed salmon, sea farmed rainbow trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, sea bass, sea bream and halibut are stunned prior to slaughter*.” \[Bi\]. Both Waitrose and the Co\-op were partners in Link\-funded research \[iii\] which extended the range of species that could be effectively and practicably stunned, given the widely differing responses between species to stunning, and also investigated stunning in sea water \(Waitrose was also a partner in \[ii\]\). The Co\-op standards also require that fish are stunned before slaughter \[Bii\]. 

 The Farm Animal Welfare Committee \(FAWC\), the expert committee to Defra and the Devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales, and which informs UK legislation and practice, produced a report in 2014, ‘Opinion on the Welfare of Farmed Fish at the Time of Killing’ \[C\]. The report is based predominantly on UoB’s research: 13 of its 20 references come from their work. The 2018 Humane Slaughter Association \(HSA, the UK charity concerned exclusively with promoting humane treatment of all food animals worldwide\) report ‘Humane Slaughter of Farmed Finfish around the world’ \[D\] acknowledges the leading work at UoB, “ *Two common methods of stunning fish, currently considered to be the most humane and globally acceptable for food safety, are electrical and percussive stunning. Both methods are already in\-use in the rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon industries, respectively, and the stunning parameters are based on scientific recommendations \(e.g. Robb et al, 2002b* \[4\] *\)*”. The report notes how methodologies for welfare assessment, humane stunning and stun\-kill are continually being refined and extended to include other fish species \[D\]. 

 UoB research continues to inform EU practice and is widely cited \(seven references\) in a 2017 review \[E\] funded by the European Commission. This report also notes that “ *The OIE and EFSA’s Scientific Opinions \(2009\) on the key fish species, provide a useful point of reference*” \(Executive Summary\). The EFSA 2009 report on salmon cites nine UoB papers whilst its trout report seven key papers from UoB research \(including \[1\-6\]\). Other international food standards that insist on humane slaughter \(stunning before kill\) include the Global Aquaculture Alliance’s Best Aquaculture Practices \(GAABAP, 2017\) \[Fii\], which base their stunning and killing on a review citing seven papers from UoB research \(including \[1,3,5\]\), and the Soil Association’s Aquaculture standards \[Fiii\], which are underpinned by the UoB\-informed FAWC guidelines \[C\]. A 2009 report published by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture \(FiBL\), ‘Stunning and slaughter methods for edible fish’, cites 13 UoB papers and forms an important part of the evidence base used by Naturland’s Standards for Organic Aquaculture \(latest version 2020\) \[Fv\]; Naturland is a major international association for organic agriculture. 

 An increasing number of worldwide standards are adopting guidelines for stunning before slaughter, not only of salmonids \(salmon and trout\), but also of other farmed fish species. The scientific evidence base for these policy changes includes the pioneering studies by UoB. For example, the World Organisation for Animal Health \(OIE\) publishes an Aquatic Animal Health Code for its 181 member countries, which states: "" *farmed fish should be stunned before killing, and the stunning method should ensure immediate and irreversible loss of consciousness”* and recommends electrical stunning for “ *carp, eel, salmonids*” \(OIE, 2019\) \[G\]. A review undertaken for the OIE by Lines \(of UoB\) and Spence \(2014\) \[H\] provided the evidence base for the Aquatic Animal Health Code and cites 11 references from the UoB team, including \[1\-6\]. A 2017 assessment of uptake of OIE guidelines, produced for the European Commission by the IBF Consortium \(cited in the HSA report \[D\]\), estimated that “ *best practices are mostly achieved, with a few exceptions*” for Atlantic salmon produced in the European Economic Area. 

#  Economic impacts: industry collaboration and commercialisation of fish stunning equipment 

 Having developed validated methods for measuring fish welfare at slaughter and defined the principal factors to achieve effective stun with fish in the laboratory, the next step for the UoB group was to upscale the stunning method for commercial settings. Robust and effective stunning equipment was needed to cope with large numbers and rapid processing of fish \(line speed in major UK farmed salmon processing factories may be 4,000 per hour, with fish weighing 10\-12kg each\). This was achieved through Kestin, Knowles and Lines’ research collaboration from 2001 with Ace Aquatec Ltd \(AA\), producers of aquaculture and marine technologies. Kestin introduced AA to the concept of electrical stunning at an industry meeting and, together, UoB and AA went on to develop and test the first prototype in\-line electrical stun systems for the humane commercial killing of farmed salmon and trout \[I\]. 

 Development work between AA and UoB is ongoing, both in\-house and via externally funded research, including GBP721,580 awarded in 2019 by the charity the Humane Slaughter Association to implement in\-water electrical stunning in aquaculture of Nile tilapia, Pangasius \(catfish\), gilthead sea bream, yellowtail and possibly carp \[I\]. 

 As a result of contributions from UoB, AA is now an award\-winning and major provider of humane fish slaughter equipment; in 2019, its Humane Stunner Universal \(HSU\) technology won a Queen’s award to industry for Enterprise Innovation, while in 2017 it was awarded the Innovation Award at Aqua Nor, the world’s largest aquaculture industry fair. HSU is now in use on farms around the world, including in Chile, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, Greece, USA and Canada \[Ii\]. Before UoB involvement, AA’s core business was seal deterrents for salmon farms. The company has experienced significant growth as a result of introducing the humane slaughter equipment into its product line. AA’s CEO sums up the considerable commercial impacts of the stunning equipment as including: “ *new regional offices in Chile, Norway, and Australia; investment … this year totalling over £4m; doubling of staff from 10 to 20 employees in six months; addition of new species to our stunning capabilities, including bream, tilapia, and prawns … The company has grown from a family run business in 2008 with a handful of deterrents sold each year, to an international business with recurring rental revenue of £2m, with an aim to double each year*.” \[Ii\]. AA has increased its net assets from GBP299,904 in 2015 to GBP3,545,347 in December 2019 \[Iii\], with sales of its humane slaughter equipment making a major contribution. AA also report that the electrical stunning equipment brings sustainability benefits, having “ *reduced waste going to landfill and provided an income to farmers/suppliers where otherwise there was an expense for removal and destruction. These products are now supplying high end restaurants and pet food where before the use of anaesthetic required them to go to landfill*.” \[Ii\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Horrocks, Motik, and Cuenca Grau in the Oxford Knowledge Representation and Reasoning group has had a wide\-ranging impact on the development and deployment of semantic technologies over the last decade. They played a leading role in developing the revised and extended World Wide Web Consortium \(W3C\) standard Web Ontology Language, OWL 2, and have developed state\-of\-the\-art reasoning systems that support this language. These represent important advances in exploiting the potential of semantic technologies for complex data and knowledge applications, and the work has led to diverse impacts across both industry and public service settings within the period. Open source reasoning tools developed in the group are enabling applications of OWL ontologies in areas as diverse as global healthcare IT \(in the SNOMED clinical terminology\) and large\-scale infrastructure design \(at the Norwegian multinational Aibel\). The researchers have also developed RDFox, a high\-performance knowledge graph and semantic reasoning engine that has created direct economic impact through the spinout company Oxford Semantic Technologies \(OST\). OST is backed by Samsung Ventures, with customers including Samsung and Festo, a German multinational industrial control and automation company. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The OWL 2 ontology language and the Resource Description Framework \(RDF\) form part of the W3C’s Semantic Web stack. These standardised formats have been key enablers for tool development and the deployment of semantic technologies across a wide range of domains and applications. At Oxford, Cuenca Grau, Horrocks, and Motik have developed novel algorithms and pioneered state\-of\-the\-art reasoning systems that support these standards, and developed technology for reasoning over RDF data and OWL ontologies that efficiently exploits the greater flexibility afforded by knowledge graphs over traditional database systems. 

 Reasoning systems are crucial for the application of ontology\-based systems, underpinning both ontology development and ontology\-based data access. HermiT is currently the only reasoner that fully supports the OWL 2 standard. It supports all of the datatypes specified in the standard, and correctly reasons about properties \(binary predicates\) as well as about classes \(unary predicates\). Building on initial work done at Manchester, Horrocks and Motik developed the system at Oxford from 2007, supported by the EPSRC standard grant “HermiT” \(2008–12\). HermiT uses a novel hypertableau algorithm that generalises so\-called absorption optimisations and provides greatly improved efficiency \[ **R1**\]. The system also employs a wide range of novel optimisation techniques, in particular techniques for reducing the size of the constructed models, and supports several extensions that go beyond the OWL standard \[ **R2**, with international collaborators\]. 

 ELK is a consequence\-based reasoner developed at Oxford. ELK uses novel algorithms that extend the range of consequence\-based reasoning to include more expressive ontology languages that go beyond the OWL 2 EL profile, a standardised subset of OWL that enjoys polynomial time worst\-case complexity for many reasoning tasks. A key feature of these algorithms is that, although the language that they support is not worst\-case polynomial, they remain optimal for subsets that do enjoy this property, as proven via parameterised complexity analysis \[ **R3**\]. ELK also employs novel parallelisation techniques to improve efficiency on modern multi\-processor architectures. 

 RDF is a standard model for data exchange on the internet and a key tool for semantic technologies. It extends the linking structure of the Web to use Universal Resource Identifiers \(URIs\) to name the relationship between things as well as the two ends of the link \(a “triple”\). This simple model allows structured and semi\-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications. The main focus of HermiT and ELK is ontology reasoning: they do support basic reasoning with RDF data, but not conjunctive queries \(the basis for the W3C standard query language SPARQL\), or scalability to large datasets. RDFox is a highly optimised RDF\-triple store developed at Oxford by Motik, Nenov, Piro, and Horrocks. RDFox uses a novel main memory architecture and parallelisation techniques to support storage and efficient query answering over billions of triples \[ **R4**\]. Query answering takes into account not only the RDF data, but also an ontology expressed using the OWL 2 RL profile, which can be seen as a fragment of Datalog. In order to make this efficient, RDFox pre\-materialises relevant entailments, and employs novel incremental materialisation algorithms to avoid costly recomputation when the underlying RDF data changes \[ **R5**\]. This is particularly difficult when combined with reasoning about equality, which is required in order to support the OWL and SPARQL standards \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our work on reasoning infrastructure for ontologies and knowledge graphs has led to a range of impacts in diverse settings. These include: 

-  impact on ontology developers, through the development of technical standards and open source tools that support these standards; 

-  impact on non\-profit organisations and businesses that develop and use ontology\-based systems; 

-  direct impacts on commerce and production through the spinout company OST and the application of its patented technology in industry. 

 **Impact on ontology development through open source reasoners for OWL 2 ontologies**. 

 Horrocks, Motik, and Cuenca Grau have been influential in the development of the OWL ontology language, editing key specification documents for the refined and extended OWL 2 standard \(second edition published by W3C in 2012\) \[ **E1**\]. The standard allows ontologies to be shared across applications, and has stimulated increasing use of ontologies in a range of sectors. Reasoning systems that support OWL, in turn, are an important enabling factor for the wider adoption of the standard and the increased uptake of ontology\-based systems. Effective reasoners are critical for ontology development and use, for example to verify the consistency of the knowledge they express, to make implicit knowledge explicit, or to access data via queries. The OWL reasoners HermiT \[ **R1**– **2**\] and ELK \[ **R3**\] have achieved wide reach as open source projects and through distribution with the open source Protégé OWL ontology editor, in which HermiT – the only reasoner that fully and correctly supports OWL \[ **R2**\] – is the standard reasoner. Protégé is the most popular tool for ontology design, with over 360,000 registered users, and is widely relied on for building and maintaining ontologies in industry and in large government projects such as the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus and the WHO’s International Classification of Diseases \[ **E2**\]. 

 Large clinical and biomedical nomenclatures like these are a prominent application area for ontologies; they are gradually superseding existing medical classifications, and will provide the future platforms for gathering and sharing medical knowledge. One such ontology is SNOMED CT, the world’s most comprehensive clinical terminology – “a codified vocabulary that is now accepted as a common global language for health terms” \[ **E3**\]. It is owned and administered by the non\-profit organisation SNOMED International, and is officially used in over 80 countries \(including the UK, a founding charter member\) to support the direct management of individual health and care and to improve the flow of data across health and care systems. SNOMED CT is an NHS Digital information standard, applying to all organisations providing NHS, Public Health, and/or Adult Social Care services. Since 2018 it has been implemented across Primary Care settings within the NHS, and is a core component of the NHS patient record service; all secondary, dentistry, and optometry services are required to establish a detailed implementation schedule by 31 December 2020 \[ **E3**, **E4**\]. 

 SNOMED International has used ELK since 2016 to perform complex reasoning tasks in its new authoring platform: “for example, to check the logical consistency of \(the definitions of\) SNOMED concepts, and to automatically organise concepts into a hierarchical structure, which is essential when dealing with such a large terminology” \[ **E3**\].  [SNOMED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOMED_CT) CT contains more than 400,000 terms and is “under constant revision and extension”. “ELK was a game changer for us as it reduced the time needed to reason with SNOMED CT from hours/days to only a few seconds. Not only that but, unlike some earlier systems, ELK was developed by researchers who were also able to provide formal and peer\-reviewed guarantees as to the correctness of the algorithms embodied in ELK \[ **R3**\]. This is clearly of great value given the critical role played by SNOMED CT in the NHS and many other national healthcare systems” \[CIO, SNOMED International: **E3**\]. 

 B2i Healthcare is a software engineering firm that specialises in SNOMED CT and healthcare information standards and exchange. B2i has used ELK across the whole assessment period to provide reasoning services in its authoring platform, Snow Owl. Snow Owl is deployed in over 3,000 locations in over 80 countries, and B2i is able to state that “ELK is the de facto global standard for classifying SNOMED CT ontologies by national eHealth programs and organizations”. These include national health ministries and agencies in the UK, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, and the USA \[Non\-Executive Chairman, B2i Healthcare: **E5**\]. B2i uses ELK because of “its outstanding performance and the correctness guarantees provided by its basis in world leading research \[ **R3**\]. ELK performs description logic classification in parallel on modern multi\-core computers, which allows the full international SNOMED CT plus the Australian extensions \(830,926 relationships\) to be classified and checked for equivalencies in about 10 seconds on a modern desktop computer. This is in stark contrast to earlier systems which took hours to perform this task, if they were capable of performing it at all. The orders of magnitude performance improvement provided by ELK means that reasoning can be used ‘on the fly’ during the authoring process, resulting in both improved quality and productivity” \[ **E5**\]. 

 Besides medical and life sciences, OWL ontologies are increasingly used in industry to address information integration and access problems. Aibel is a multinational company headquartered in Norway that provides engineering and construction services in the oil, gas, and offshore wind industries. Aibel has used HermiT across the whole assessment period to \(i\) support the development of a new master ontology system for design requirements and specifications; and \(ii\) perform reasoning and query answering over this custom\-built ontology to configure design and product selection. These tasks are now “performed with greater precision and less effort than with Aibel’s legacy system, ultimately resulting in a design of higher quality, which again reduces the total time and cost of construction” \[Senior Manager: **E6**\]. Aibel uses HermiT because of “its full support for the OWL ontology language, and its superior performance, reliability and scalability” in ontology reasoning \[ **E6**; see **R1**– **R2**\]. Using HermiT, Aibel has been able to document significant reductions in data errors and duplications. In the context of the very large projects delivered by the company, such deficiencies in data quality can have significant cost implications: for example, the presence of duplicate design artefacts leads to erroneous bulk orders of materials. The knowledge\-based approach enabled by HermiT supports “a more efficient and precise description of design artefacts…removing practically all duplicate design artefacts recorded in the system. \(It is estimated that more than 30% of the legacy system’s data was duplicate data.\) The lack of duplicates and added detail in design descriptions make it easier to manage material storage and order a better selection of materials…The effect is an estimated cost reduction of approximately 5% for bulk material orders, which in large projects amounts to more than EUR100,000,000” \[ **E6**\]. Aibel states that: “in summary, HermiT plays an important role at Aibel, and has enabled us to deploy knowledge\-based solutions that significantly reduce cost” \[ **E6**\]. 

 **Impact in industry through commercialisation of high\-performance RDFox system**. 

 **Pathway to impact**. The highly scalable RDFox tool was initially released for research purposes in 2014 under an open source licence. A patent was also filed on the underpinning research: this would later be significant to the commercialisation of the technology through the spinout company OST \[ **E7**\]. The Oxford team subsequently worked with industrial partners to develop the technology into a mature platform with performance bottlenecks identified and removed \[ **R5**, **R6**\]. RDFox was applied in several pilot industry projects, including with Siemens, for ontology\-based data access enhancement \(2015\); Statoil \(now Equinor\), for integration and analysis of oil production and geological survey data \(2016\); Kaiser Permanente, in patient data analysis for healthcare compliance \(2016\); EDF Energy, to manage and analyse information about their electricity distribution network \(2016\); and other partners including Skyscanner, for recommender engines, and Armasuisse for text analysis \[ **E8**\]. During these pilot projects the functionality of RDFox was extended to match business requirements. 

 In 2017, OST was formed to bring cutting\-edge research in semantic technologies to industry. OST has raised GBP4,100,000 in investment, including GBP3,000,000 in Series A investment led by Samsung Ventures, announced in June 2019 \[ **E9**\]. By September 2019 OST employed 6 full\-time staff; 9 FTEs were employed by the end of the assessment period. OST’s patented technology is sold under licence to customers for a fee of approximately GBP50,000 per licence. Since April 2018, the company has secured licence sales worth over GBP570,000 \[ **E10**\]. Customers include Festo, a German multinational production line equipment company, and electronics giant Samsung. 

 Festo produce and sell pneumatic and electrical control and drive technology for factory or process automation. They have used RDFox since 2018 to implement a new semantic approach to data processing through the Festo Semantic Platform \[ **E11**, **E12**.2\]. In turn, the semantic approach has allowed them to optimise their sales process. Festo’s “choice of RDFox was based on its outstanding performance, reliability and scalability” compared to other knowledge graph systems, and its basis “in published algorithms whose correctness has been formally verified”, giving “high confidence that RDFox will continue to provide correct answers regardless of the knowledge and the queries that we use” \[Head of Smart Data Services: **E11**\]. RDFox’s performance advantages have a direct impact on production at Festo. The company’s product catalogue includes thousands of components that can be combined in millions of different configurations, with configurations being subject to many complex constraints. RDFox is used to compute possible configurations and to ensure their validity. The previous approach, using multiple relational databases, “took several hours to compute valid configurations, and also required complex data maintenance and deployment management. In contrast, RDFox can compute valid configurations in a few seconds…This saves us a huge amount of time and also allows for much greater flexibility in updating our product catalogue” \[ **E11**\]. The company has found that “the semantic approach is also much easier to maintain and extend” \[ **E11**\]. Queries are now “much easier to write”, and “extensions or changes in the information model due to technical or business demands are much faster accomplished and validated. That is a significant increase in flexibility as well as saving time and computing resources” \[ **E12**.1\]. As a result, Festo are extending the Semantic Platform to cover further technical product domains. As “a key component of the Festo Semantic Platform”, RDFox is central to this new approach across the company, “and as such is already having a significant impact on our data management business” \[ **E11**; see also **E12**.2\]. 

 Prior to their investment in OST, Samsung had already funded various projects, worth approximately GBP500,000, with a view to using RDFox in several different customer\-facing applications. Samsung are now using the RDFox knowledge graph system “to drive applications running on a variety of platforms including embedded systems and mobile devices \(phones and tablets\)”; these include, for example, lifestyle recommender systems linking very large and heterogeneous data sets covering areas such as food, health, and exercise. “When fully deployed, \[Samsung\] expect such applications to be running on millions of devices, all of which will access relevant knowledge via RDFox” \[ **E13**\]. Samsung’s choice of RDFox “was based on its outstanding performance, reliability and scalability.” Other knowledge graph systems tested by Samsung “were all found to be much slower than RDFox, often by orders of magnitude, and could also produce incorrect answers…In summary, RDFox is a key component of our knowledge\-intensive applications, and we expect such applications to be used by hundreds of millions of Samsung customers worldwide” \[ **E13**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at BCU\-hosted Eastside Projects \(EP\) has created significant civic impact by re\-defining the role of ‘publics’ for commissioning artists and in the formation of Birmingham City Council’s **Public Art Strategy** \(2015–19\). This is achieved at regional level and led to the commissioning of Turner Prize\-winner Susan Philipsz’s £2m public artwork for HS2 Curzon Station, applying EP’s approach to **Making Art Public**. EP’s activities have stimulated emerging creative practices in **development planning**, through collaboration with David Kohn Architects, winning the £60m 2020 competition to design Birmingham’s Smithfield Market. The reach of EP’s impact can be seen in its model for artist\-curator practice being adopted by **international artist\-run spaces** across the UK and Europe. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 EP is a research space for creative practice at Birmingham Institute of Creative Arts \(BICA\). EP created the opportunities for a range of research activities set within an ‘artist\-run multiverse’, combining critical aspects of traditional and alternative art institutional structures with newly invented approaches such as user’s manuals, long term artworks, upcycling, and useful art. For the researchers in BICA, EP provides an open, accessible space that performs in diverse ways, continuously challenging the role of art and artists in the contemporary world through public evaluation events, policy shows and Extra Ordinary People. 

 All the research on which this ICS is based is enacted through engagement between publics, curators and artists to re\-examine the nature and understanding of art’s primary function as exhibition. As an artist\-run organisation EP differs from established models of public museums and galleries as it constantly explores collaborative possibilities from an artist\-curator perspective, exploring how art can be understood in a variety of ways: as a trade, as a production process, as an activity engaged in policymaking and place\-making, and as hospitality. **\[R1\]** 

 **Making Art Public** 

 EP’s practice philosophy focuses on Making Art Public, applied through its operation as an Arts Council England National Portfolio Organisation. EP’s aim is to test ways in which art can be useful to society by developing quality public projects focusing on history, people, and concepts of permanence, and by questioning and supporting the local artistic ecology. EP co\-curated ‘The Event’, an artist led festival \(2009/2011\), and ‘Public Art Forum Debate’ at Birmingham City Council Chamber \(2013\). As we set out in Section 4, this enabled our research to shape the way in which artists and art are involved in development and urban planning processes. **\[R2\]** 

 The action\-based nature of our work means that research, knowledge exchange and impact are all integrated. For instance, the ACE\-funded £230K project \(2016\-2021\) developed new knowledge which was then utilised by EP\-based researchers when they were invited by Cherwell District Council to commission a series of public artworks at Longford Park, a large\-scale new housing development and country park in Banbury. Through the curatorial activities of EP\-based researchers, we tested key concepts of ‘useful art’, and then used these insights, and our strong working relationships with council officers, to update and inform the Council’s ongoing approach. By working with world\-renowned public art creators, in co\-produced projects, EP\-based researchers were able to explore: artist\-led housing with Studio Morison; the ecology of country parks and housing through an expanded model village of birdhouses with artist Richard Woods; a heated outdoor cast\-aluminium sculpture with artist Nicolas Deshayes; and a participatory budgeting process with artist Rosalie Schweiker. As researcher\-curators, our co\-produced research initiatives enabled the artists to deploy their work in collaboration with stakeholders in local industry, creating a new model of public art production and council commissioning. **\[R3\]** 

 Additionally, EP’s public and professional engagement programme *Extra Ordinary People* develops alternative models of art training which focus on collaboration and social responsibility in art practice. In addition, in emphasising co\-production, we explicitly challenge a range of ‘publics’ to become active producers within the art works, not just consumers of culture in the West Midlands. 

 **The Artist and The Engineer** 

 A major development in EP’s research on public art is their work on embodying forms that closely reflect the historical identity Birmingham. EP created and published *The Artist and The Engineer* in the form of a children’s book that retells the story of Birmingham, adopting the ‘heraldic supporters’ from the city’s coat of arms \(an artist and an engineer\) and re\-presenting historical precedents for collaboration. This story became central for research within EP. Researchers tested concepts of ‘layering’ \(maintaining and integrating diverse cultural positions and old architecture with new in development processes\) and ‘usefulness in art’ through work with local industry, publishing, making, performing, designing, writing production processes, and ideas of upcycling. This research was conducted through a series of reflective and collaboratively authored publications titled *User’s Manual* \(drafts 1\-7 since 2008 **\[R4\]**; *User’s Manual: Draft 6* \(2013\) is *The Artist and The Engineer*\). A series of exhibitions entitled ‘Production Shows’ \(2016\-2018\) **\[R5\]** were also informed by Wade’s *Upcycle This Book* **\[R6\]** published in 2017 and Ruth Claxton’s development of STEAMhouse \(2018–\).

 **IMPACT ON PUBLIC ART \(STRATEGY AND COMMISSIONING\) IN BIRMINGHAM** 

 **Wade,** as a member of the Public Art Gateway Group, informed the writing, development and implementation of the Birmingham City Council \(BCC\) Public Art Strategy \(2015\-2019\). We have established a range of pathways to impact, positioning EP as a leading voice in regional arts strategy and forming strong partnerships for knowledge exchange. For instance, **Wade**’s \(2013\-2016\) Birmingham Post articles argued for developing new approaches to public art. This allowed EP to establish strong relationships with arts officers at Birmingham City Council \(BCC\). These emerging pathways were enhanced following the government Big City Culture strategy \(2010\-2015\), which focused on developing a cultural infrastructure in the West Midlands, enabling EP to offer leadership in public art commissioning. 

 EP’s research on Making Art Public influenced BCC’s definition of public art published in 2015: “Public art is a place\-based creative practice: the act of producing permanent or temporary \(including participatory and event\-based\) art within the public realm”. **\[S01:** Evidence from Birmingham Public Art Strategy 2015\-2019 **\]** The relationship between EP and BCC allowed EP to lead the commissioning process \(appointed in 2015\) for the ‘Birmingham Big Art Project’, a £2 million iconic public artwork to be produced in front of HS2 Curzon Station. **\[S02:** Extracts from BBAP Artist Brief **\]** In April 2017 Susan Philipsz’s *Station Clock* was chosen after an 18\-month public process. *Station Clock* embodies the mission of EP to activate publics in art\-making processes. The 12 ‘digits’ of *Station Clock* each represent a tone from the twelve tones of the universal chromatic scale. Philipsz’s large\-scale aural clock will be made up of 1,092 voices from Birmingham’s diverse population recorded in partnership with Royal Birmingham Conservatoire and EP \(started in 2019 – on hold due to COVID\-19\). **\[S02:** Statements by Susan Philipsz and Chairman of BBAP **,** Participants Feedback extracted from Birmingham Big Art Project website **\]** 

 **IMPACT ON CITY DEVELOPMENT PLANNING \( **THE ARTIST AND THE ENGINEER**\)** 

 EP’s research into the unique iconography of Birmingham’s coat of arms became, according to the leader of BCC, “ *a strong reminder not only of our past but of our future as a city.*” **\[S03: T**estimony by Leader of Birmingham City Council **\]** EP’s mission to bring attention to the history and ideology of Birmingham as a constant collaboration between an artist and an engineer, and their commitment to reinvent the role of the artist and artist\-run institutions, led to a partnership with David Kohn Architects \(DKA\) to design the new £60m market in Birmingham, part of the £1.5 billion redevelopment of Smithfield. The director of DKA acknowledges the influence EP’s research had on securing the Smithfield bid: “ *Out ambition for collaboration on large\-scale projects has taken a leap forward in working with Eastside Projects on the Birmingham Smithfield Markets. …EP generously shared their intimate knowledge of the city and were co\-authors of our approach to the challenge of designing new public spaces for the city. …EP’s previous research into the relationship of art to production, as evidenced by the artist and engineer on the city’s coat\-of\-arms became a central idea in our approach.*” **\[S03: Testimony by Director of David Kohn Architects\]** To have an artist\-run space involved in city development planning on any scale was a novel enactment as observed by Acting Assistant Director Development Planning and Development Department at Birmingham City Council: “The inclusion of Eastside Projects was not only a masterstroke by DKA, but it was also a brave move and exactly what Birmingham was looking for.” **\[S03: Testimony by Acting** Assistant Director Development Planning & Development Department Birmingham City Council, **S04:** Press coverage **\]** 

 **IMPACT ON INTERNATIONAL ARTIST\-RUN INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES \(ARTIST CURATOR\)** 

 The developing research, co\-production and knowledge exchange activity embedded in EP has achieved international reach by becoming a model for other art spaces beyond the UK. For instance, the international presentation platform for visual arts, Kunsthal Gent \(KG\) in Ghent, Belgium has adopted EP’s approach to research. In particular, they emphasise activating and redefining artist\-run spaces in city development and planning. 

 This growing international impact has been achieved through the development of events on artists\-run multiverses; a user manual; and Wade’s role\-modelling of new forms of curatorial practice. The ‘Artist\-Run Multiverse Summit’, organised by EP in November 2018 engaged other international artist\-run spaces to discuss their roles in relation to art, curating and communities. Additionally, invitations from international art venues and Biennials, have enabled Wade to present his approach to the wider global public arts community. 

 As Kunsthal Gent’s manifesto makes clear, Wade’s research was adopted and has become dominant since their inception in January 2019 **: “ **Kunsthal Gent** is a result of the interaction between the impressive architecture of the building and the spatial interventions that will be carried out within it. … Eastside Projects \(UK\), serve as an inspiration to us in this: How can architecture and design support exhibition making alongside the curation process? Can architecture and design be understood as a form of curation? Can we imagine a context for exhibitions and exhibition making that produces rather than embodies or represents the exhibition itself?*” **\[S05:** The mission statement of \(KG\), 2019 and testimony by the programme lead at KG **\]** 

 EP’s publishing of user’s manuals became central to KG practice, leading KG to write and publish their own user’s manual in 2019, which not only borrows elements from EP’s previous publications but also includes Wade’s work to support the establishment of KG. The programme lead at KG said: “The user’s manual as we know it from EP, through Gavin, sounded like a useful tool for ourselves, for the artists and for the visitors to understand the complex situation, position and ideas Kunsthal Gent had in mind”. **\[S05:** testimony by the programme lead at KG, KG user’s manual referring to Gavin Wade and Eastside Projects **\]**

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cascade Technologies Ltd is a spinout from the Department of Physics at the University of Strathclyde. Using a new approach to mid\-IR spectroscopic gas sensing patented by Strathclyde, Cascade Technologies manufactures a range of gas sensors for both environmental and process monitoring that are sold either globally through Emerson or as original equipment manufacturer \(OEM\) systems to other manufacturers. These sensors are used in a range of gas sensing markets, including the shipping, car manufacturing, aerosol and food packing industries, where they have contributed to improved environmental pollution monitoring and food quality assurance. From 2014 to 2020 Cascade Technologies increased annual turnover from GBP5,800,000 to GBP10,300,000, and now employs 85 highly skilled staff, an increase of 42 from 2014.

##  2. Underpinning research 

###  Context 

 The growing awareness of the negative effects of climate change and environmental pollution, demonstrated through international commitments to reduce emissions of key atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases \(including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and sulphur hexafluoride\), has led to an increasing demand for instrumentation capable of detecting and quantifying the concentrations of such pollutants, be they environmental or related to manufacturing processes such as aerosol production. Laser spectroscopy for trace gas detection has been shown to be a suitable basis for such instrumentation. 

###  Key Research Findings 

 From 1999, Dr Langford and Prof Duxbury established a research programme, supported initially by EPSRC funding, to investigate the potential of pulsed distributed feedback quantum cascade lasers \(DFB\-QCL\) for trace gas detection. The mid\- to long\-infrared emission of these devices makes them of particular interest for atmospheric trace gas detection.  Further, their physical compactness and robust nature make them suitable for practical application. The key outcome from this research was the development of a new type of laser\-based spectrometer using intra\-pulse spectroscopy, which combined DFB\-QCLs with multi\-mirror long path gas cells for the rapid detection and quantification of trace gases \[ **R1**, **R2**\]. 

 This intra\-pulse spectroscopy approach was significantly different from the methodology used by other researchers for the detection of trace gases. In contrast to other research groups who utilised short duration \(<20ns\) optical pulses to detect trace gases, the Strathclyde approach used long duration optical pulses \(0.3\-2<span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF06D;</span>s\). A consequence of operating a DFB\-QCL in pulsed mode is that it causes temporal variation of the laser frequency, known as a chirp. This frequency chirp is important as it \(i\) eliminates optical interference effects in the multiple mirror cell \(these interference effects impose sensitivity limits on multiple mirror cell spectrometers using fixed frequency sources\) and \(ii\) allows the absorption spectrum of the trace gas to be written onto the time profile of the pulse, giving a simple way of observing the spectrum. 

 Furthermore, the frequency windows generated by the intra\-pulse approach using longer pulses up to 2µs, as in the Strathclyde work, are large enough \(typically 100GHz\) to observe multiple species of gases, or multiple lines of the same species simultaneously. This gives the user the ability to determine the concentration of a single gas using several different absorption lines, or to monitor the variation in concentrations of multiple gases. Application examples include in industrial processes such as monitoring changes in acetylene in the growth of synthetic diamond, or tracking changes in methane and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere for environmental monitoring. 

 Initial research focussed on the demonstration of the technique in a laboratory setting \[ **R1**, **R2**\] and established detection sensitivities of the order of 500 parts in 10<sup>9</sup>, equating to the measurement of absorptions of less than 1%.  While a useful tool for fundamental studies of molecular species, the main focus of the next phase of research was the further refinement of the approach and testing in practical settings.  This was supported by a range of funders including the National Environment Research Council \(NERC\) and the Atomic Weapons Establishment \(AWE\), enabling investigation of the intra\-pulse spectroscopy technique in a range of settings: 

-  In\-flight measurements made on a NERC\-supported airborne survey and research facility \(ASRF\) aeroplane demonstrated the detection of atmospheric methane, nitrous oxide and water on flights from Oxford to Wales; results were related to possible sources in the flight path. \[ **R3**\] 

-  Real\-time diagnostics of the amounts of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water, in the exhaust of an aero gas turbine \(turbojet\) engine operated in a sea level test cell demonstrated the monitoring of the time evolution of exhaust gases from combustion processes. \[ **R4**\] 

-  Real\-time detection and observation of the evolution of carbon dioxide and ethylene in the exhaust by\-products from several cars demonstrated the applicability of the technique to the automotive industry. \[ **R5**\] 

 These practical demonstrations of the effectiveness of the intra\-pulse spectroscopy approach for trace gas detection set the scene for the commercial application of the technique.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 **From research to impact** 

 The intra\-pulse spectroscopy technique described, allowing for interference\-free operation to be achieved in multi\-pass optical cells, was patented by the University of Strathclyde in 2003 \( *A semiconductor diode arrangement*, GB0208100.8, *Semiconductor diode laser spectrometer arrangement and method*, US Patent 7,283,243, 2007\). The patent was subsequently assigned to Cascade Technologies Ltd, a company established by Erwan Normand, a former doctoral student of Langford’s, in 2003 \[ **S1**\]. As noted by Cascade Technologies’ Lead Technologist: 

 ‘*This allowed Cascade Technologies to become the first supplier of quantum cascade laser\-based spectrometers capable of making trace gas measurements.*’ \[ **S2**\] 

 The company went on to develop instrumentation that has been applied to many different gas sensing markets. During the period 1 August 2013 – 31 December 2020, a range of impacts have been realised: 

-  Economic impact of Cascade Technologies – new product development, sales turnover, creation of high\-quality high\-tech jobs and market development via trade sale of company 

-  Adoption of Cascade Technologies emissions monitoring products by customers across a range of industry sectors, with associated economic and environmental impacts. 

###  Impact 1: Economic impact of Cascade Technologies 

 Cascade Technologies’ strength in a variety of different markets contributed to the decision of US\-based electronics manufacturer Emerson to purchase the company in 2014 for GBP37,000,000 \[ **S3**\]. This gave Emerson access to a range of sensors operating in the mid\-infrared, a wavelength range that their existing products didn’t cover, thereby strengthening their position as a manufacturer of sensing systems. The purchase has also granted Cascade Technologies, as a subsidiary of Emerson, further access to global markets, increasing the reach of the technology underpinned by Strathclyde research. 

 The growth of Cascade Technologies has benefitted the UK economy and led to the employment of highly skilled graduate\-level staff. Table 1 shows the company’s growth from March 2013 to September 2020 \[ **S4a**, **b**\]. Note the 18\-month reporting period from March 2015 to September 2016 and that figures for year to 30 September 2020 are estimates. Aggregated turnover in the period amounted to approximately GBP62,500,000, with staff doubling from 43 in 2014 to 85 in 2019. 

| **Table 1:** | **Year to** | **Turnover \(GBP\)** | **Gross profit \(GBP\)** | **Staff at end date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|| 31/03/2014 | 5,801,500 | 2,574,590 | 43 |
|| 31/03/2015 | 6,474,663 | 2,970,917 | 49 |
|| 30/09/2016 | 13,252,621 | 7,534,577 | 64 |

 Table 2, provides a representative breakdown of Cascade Technologies’ turnover by geographical region for the financial year ending September 2018 \[ **S2**\], illustrating the global reach of the company’s products. 

| **Table 2:** | **Area** | **Turnover, 2017/18** | **% of total** |

|| North America | 1,345,203 | 13% |
|| Rest of World | 364,256 | 3% |

 For the same period, two key market sectors were \[Text removed for publication\] \(turnover GBP4,723,800\) and aerosol leak detection \(turnover GBP2,237,881\), with sales into marine contract equipment manufacturers an emerging market sector for the company. In addition, approximately GBP3,000,000 of turnover related to service and maintenance contracts \[ **S2**\].  The impact that these sales enable for Cascade Technologies’ customers are discussed further in the following section. 

####  Impact 2: Impacts realised by Cascade Technologies’ customers 

 The compact nature, sensitivity and speed at which signals are generated \(<0.1s\) by Cascade Technologies’ sensors have seen these instruments sold to a variety of different markets, including the shipping, automotive, aerosol and food packing industries, where they are used to ensure that companies meet the strict emission guidelines set out by EU and US regulatory bodies. In this way Cascade Technologies’ products contribute to effective environmental pollution and manufacturing process monitoring, with resulting positive impacts on production, on compliance with environmental regulation and on the environment. 

####  Automotive industry: monitoring vehicle emissions 

 With the rise of global environmental consciousness, including the need to restrict greenhouse gases, global regulations on vehicle exhaust emissions have become more stringent, demanding reductions of several pollutants notably nitrogen oxides \(NOx including NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O\) and ammonia NH<sub>3</sub>. Industry therefore has a need for easy and accurate measurement of these gases in vehicle emissions. 

 The ease with which Cascade Technologies’ frequency chirped system can be integrated with gas handling lines has seen this instrumentation become an integral component of combustion engine exhaust monitoring systems \[Text removed for publication\]. \[Text removed for publication\] \[ **S5**\] systems, which utilise multiple QCL sources of varying mid\-IR wavelengths to provide simultaneous analysis of the multiple NOx pollutants, are sold to a range of companies across the automotive supply chain including all global car manufacturers, tier one suppliers, fuel companies and catalyst manufacturers that perform engine tests \[ **S6**\]. \[Text removed for publication\] 

####  Maritime industry: monitoring pollution from ships 

 Emissions associated with global shipping fleets are significant contributors to global warming. The ability of the intra\-pulse spectroscopy technique to give rapid species\-specific information in a compact footprint has seen the technology adopted for the monitoring of smoke stack emissions from ships. The sensors developed by Cascade Technologies are used to ensure that the companies that have purchased the instrumentation meet the strict emission guidelines set out by EU and USA regulatory bodies. 

 To this end, in September 2019 Cascade Technologies signed an original equipment manufacturer \(OEM\) agreement with \[Text removed for publication\] \[ **S2**\], one of the world’s largest maritime emissions monitoring companies, to provide instrumentation capable of the simultaneous detection of emissions from up to eight species including SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, CO, O<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>. The resulting \[Text removed for publication\] systems incorporating Cascade Technologies products are recognised and accepted by various bodies, including the American Bureau of Shipping, the Korean Register, Lloyds Register, DNV\-GL \(a major industry accredited registrar and classification society\) and the European Union for its Monitoring, Reporting and Verification \(MRV\) requirements \[ **S7**\]. 

####  Manufacturing process monitoring 

 In addition to the OEM supply of spectroscopy components for emissions monitoring described above, Cascade Technologies also develops full monitoring systems primarily for environmental process monitoring. The company’s CT2210 Micro Leak Detector system offers a simple cost\-effective approach to detecting defective aerosol cans when compared with the competing approaches of monitoring bubbles in water baths, using acoustic sensors or flame ionisation detectors. It can operate on production lines running at up to 500 cans per minute compared with the 200 cans per minute limitation of conventional systems. The system satisfies the leak detection performance requirements as specified by the Fédération Européenne des Aérosols \(FEA\) in its FEA Waterbath Alternative Guidelines, and has been certified to comply with EU transport regulations \[ **S8**\]. 

 With some 3 billion aerosol cans produced annually in the US alone, the success of the CT2210 Micro Leak Detector in improving the productivity of aerosol manufacturers has led to this technology becoming embedded in the production lines of all major aerosol manufacturers \[Text removed for publication\] \[ **S2**\].  The system was highly commended in the Process Safety and Training category of the British Aerosol Manufacturers’ Association annual awards in 2019 \[ **S9**\]. 

 Furthermore, the simplicity and robustness of the instrumentation makes it well suited for use in the food packing industry, where concerns about food quality, level of ripeness and the airtightness of packaging have led to the adoption of Cascade Technologies’ instrumentation in this sector. The Rosemount CT 4215 Packaging Leak Detection System marketed by Emerson \[ **S10**\] is a modified version of the Cascade Technologies CT2211 Microleak Detection System and has been used for leak detection in a variety of food processing industries ranging from brewing to dairy at speeds of up to 200 packs per minute. The primary market is food packaged in a protective atmosphere, such as fresh meat, dried meat \(for example beef jerky\) and cheese \[ **S2**\]. 

 In summary, the impacts realised in the period 1 August 2013 – 30 December 2020 encompass not only the economic impacts of Cascade as a successful technology company – new products, sales and employment – and the economic impacts of both their OEM and end\-product customer companies, but also the efficiency and cost savings, plus the safety, regulatory compliance and environmental improvements that result from the use of Cascade products.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by the Electoral Psychology Observatory has been used to improve election processes around the world and enhance the electoral experience for citizens, notably disabled and first\-time voters. The research has led to changes in ballot paper design and polling station organisation in the Palestinian Territories, underpinned \[text removed for publication\] decision to shelve electoral reforms that would have increased inequality in access to the vote for minority groups, contributed expert evidence to a landmark Irish Supreme Court case on the influence of government communications on voters' perceptions, improved Opinium's political polling methodology to deliver more accurate election forecasts, helped to shape best practice among election management bodies and establish new initiatives recognising excellence in electoral affairs, and influenced the writing and production of a new Apple Television series. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2011, the Electoral Psychology Observatory \(EPO, previously ECREP\) has conducted research on electoral psychology and electoral ergonomics. It is led by Professor Michael Bruter and Dr Sarah Harrison. The work of the EPO represents a shift in approach to electoral research, making it truly “voter\-centric”. Fundamentally, this involves refocusing electoral research on the voter’s point of view; who people vote for is less important than understanding how elections affect citizens’ happiness or emotions, or under what circumstances they will bring them a sense of closure and resolution. This shift has tremendous implications for how we approach elections as an object and voters as actors, the questions we ask, the methods we use \(over 90% of political behaviour is, in fact, subconscious\), and our understanding of the interface between voters’ psychology and electoral organisation \(what we label “electoral ergonomics”\). 

 The impacts described here are underpinned by research insights in six key areas: 1\) on voters’ psychology and the nature and implications of their electoral experiences; 2\) on the interface between voters’ psychology and election design \(electoral ergonomics\); 3\) on the nature and importance of the first electoral experience \(first\-time voters\); 4\) on the electoral experience of vulnerable categories \(disabled voters, illiterate voters, minorities, etc\); 5\) on the consequences of electoral psychology and experience of fractures with potential to split societies \(electoral hostility\); and 6\) on how new variables and methods can be adapted to everyday stakeholders’ practice, from electoral observation and polling to culture \(conceptual and methodological toolbox\). 

 EPO research combines innovative methodologies \(visual electoral experiments, electoral family focus groups, panel election diaries\) with classic approaches \(e.g. panel study surveys of up to five years, physiological experiments, field experiments, interviews, etc.\). Key findings include: 

 **On voter psychology** 

-  *The atmosphere of elections changes in the last week:* 20\-30% of voters change their minds within a week of a typical major election, half of them on Election Day **\[1\]**. 

-  *First times matter:* participating in one of the first two elections of a citizen’s life will likely make them chronic participants whilst abstaining from both will likely lead to chronic abstention **\[4\]**. 

-  *Elections are emotional:* 25% of Americans have cried because of an election and 63% say that election night makes them feel emotional; 34% of British voters had tears in their eyes in relation to the EU Membership referendum, including 49% of 18\-25\-year\-olds **\[1\]**. 

-  *Elections are positive experiences:* 63% of voters say that they feel happy in the polling booth, 60% feel excited, 74% proud, and 79% say that it is an important moment for them. Moreover, excitement is a bigger driver of turnout than duty to vote, especially amongst young people **\[1\]**. 

 **On electoral ergonomics** 

-  *People vote differently when they vote remotely:* 18\-25\-year\-old British postal\-voters were twice as likely to vote for the extreme right than those who went to a polling station **\[3\]**. 

-  *In\-station voting makes voters happier and more sociotropic:* in\-station voters tend to feel more efficacious, more positive about democracy, and relate to other citizens more than remote voters. Young voters are notably less positive when voting from home \(by post/email\) **\[2\]**. 

-  *Not all remote voting options were created equal:* in US elections, “advance” voting leads to more sociotropic voting than “absentee” voting, and voters describe their electoral experience as happier and more exciting, and are more likely to vote at the next election **\[1\]**. 

-  *Ballot design affects thinking time:* when voting electronically, voters think for an average of 20 seconds before casting their vote, compared to 30 seconds with a UK paper ballot, and one minute with French paper ballots. Machine voting leads to more negative emotions **\[1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts described here are the result of the EPO's sustained engagement with diverse groups of electoral stakeholders throughout the REF assessment period. This includes electoral commissions, governments, polling agencies, electoral observers, and the High Court. The research has been used to make concrete changes to the running of elections \(e.g. to polling station organisation and ballot paper design\), developed the skills and capacities of those working on elections, informed changes to polling methodologies, and shaped and encouraged the recognition of best practice among electoral practitioners. These changes have contributed to an improved experience of elections, notably among disabled, first\-time, and minority voters, and to greater accuracy in election polling. Details of these impacts are described below. 

 **Optimising electoral procedures for voters in the Palestinian Territories** 

 In May 2015, Bruter and Harrison led a two\-day training session for senior staff of the Central Electoral Commission \(CEC\) of the Palestinian Territories **\[A\]**. This session was funded by the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) to strengthen democracy in the Palestinian Territories and built upon earlier engagement with the CEC that also included a smaller capacity\-building event in London in 2015. This particular session addressed a variety of electoral psychology issues identified as important to the Palestinian context \- including social divisions, gender inequalities, and civic education \- and considered how these interact with, and might precipitate a change in approach to, electoral management **\[1\] \[3\] \[4\]**. The CEO of the CEC credits this session \- allied to other insights from EPO research on electoral ergonomics \- with having prompted a shift in the CEC's role "" *from mere implementer of elections processes to more open and proactive roles promoting \[the\] democratic process in full partnership with the community it serves*"", particularly evident in a changed "" *approach to address first\-time voters and \[introduction of\] a new design of the polling stations to respond to the needs of people with disabilities*"" **\[A\]**. 

 Subsequently, electoral reforms enacted in 2016 have introduced new laws on candidate eligibility, allowing greater gender representation and lowering the minimum age requirement, both initiatives intended to promote greater feelings of inclusion and identification among women and younger voters. Technical changes have led to the redesign of ballot papers and polling stations to better accommodate the needs of disabled voters. And the establishment of a new Electoral Awareness Fund and outreach initiatives led by civil society organisations form part of a drive to increase participation in the forthcoming 2021 municipal elections. 

 Addressing these various initiatives, the CEC CEO has said: "" *We at the CEC firmly believe that using insights from the Bruter and Harrison research \[has\] contributed to better understanding \[of\] the way we serve voters in elections regardless of age, gender or disabilities, and will lead to a better experience and participation of the Palestinian citizens in the coming years*"". These benefits extend to 2.2 million voters in the municipal elections **\[A\]**. 

-  **Ensuring equitable elections and effective access to the vote for all \[text removed for publication\] citizens** 

 At the request of \[text removed for publication\], Bruter and Harrison provided expert advice to \[text removed for publication\] on proposed reforms of the country’s electoral system. Their submitted report **\[B\]** convinced the government to limit its planned reforms on the basis that they would increase inequality in access to the vote for some minorities and be psychologically unacceptable to parts of the population, resulting in a compromise reform in December 2014. 

 The government’s proposal put forward two alternative plans based on a mixture of plurality and best\-loser system, with a top up proportional allocation based on an “unreturned votes elect” system. Bruter and Harrison designed six institutional tests and six psychological tests that should be met by any viable electoral system reform and simulated the impact of the two electoral system reforms under consideration. Following the collection of electoral psychology data, Bruter and Harrison’s analysis, firmly grounded in the underpinning research **\[1\] \[2\]**, showed that the proposed reforms could increase unfairness, negatively affect the representation of some of the country’s minorities, entrench gender inequality, and be viewed negatively by \- and lack the acceptance of \- \[text removed for publication\] **\[B\]**. The original reform plan was consequently shelved by the Prime Minister and replaced by cross\-party discussions. 

-  **Providing expert witness advice in an Irish constitutional referendum case** 

 Bruter served as Expert Witness in cases tried by the Irish High Court and the Irish Supreme Court on the impact of the Irish Government’s framing of the Referendum on Children’s Rights on voters’ behaviour. \(This referendum was held to approve an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland which inserted clauses relating to children's rights and the right and duty of the state to take child protection measures.\) The government’s campaign was accused of being biased in favour of a “Yes” vote \(i.e. approval of the amendment\) and the Courts were asked to judge whether the campaign was, in fact, neutral and thereby constitutional \(first case\), and also whether it could have materially affected the outcome \(second case\). The government lost the first case in a landmark judgment but won the second \(i.e. the referendum result was not overturned\) in a final Supreme Court judgment of 24 April 2015. Bruter’s evidence **\[2\] \[3\]** figured prominently in proceedings, as noted in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice John MacMenamin: “ *the appellant sought to base a substantial part of her case on Dr Bruter’s conclusions, reached following his analysis of the raw data*” **\[C**, para. 48 **\]**. Bruter’s expert evidence is referenced extensively throughout the judgment **\[C**, paras. 40\-61 **\]**. 

 **Improving political polling methodologies to more accurately forecast election results** 

 The EPO has worked regularly and extensively with Opinium, the political polling agency, throughout the current REF assessment period. They have worked together on numerous international electoral survey studies, with the EPO providing research input on the design of sample frames, the scripts for questionnaires, and on the deployment of surveys to nationally representative samples of citizens of various countries, at various points in the election cycle **\[D\]**. Meetings with the Opinium electoral forecasting team were held to discuss weighting variations based on EPO findings on electoral psychology, including developing new measures identifying which voters are most likely to change their minds in the run up to an election, and controlling for registration before applying weightings to avoid over\-estimating youth abstention **\[1\] \[3\]**. 

 The Chief Executive of Opinium considers the learnings from this collaboration to have been key to the Opinium political polling team having been the most accurate research agency at the 2019 General Election and one of just two agencies to have accurately predicted the outcome of the EU referendum in 2016: "" *Without a doubt, credit must be given to the inspiration and learnings we have gained from the EPO which has undoubtedly influenced how we as an agency look to understand the voting psychology of the British voters. For example, insights from EPO’s research have been critical in taking into account psychological variables in panel and sample design. Conversely, their work on question phrasing has helped us optimise variables that we use in political polling and barometer studies. Most importantly the importance of personality and emotion, both of which now have a place in our own methodology*"" **\[D\]**. Opinium carry out frequent election surveys in the UK and the US and provide regular political polling for national and international media, notably *The* *Observer*. 

 **Influencing best practice in electoral management** 

 EPO research has also been used by electoral stakeholders who work internationally to improve the practices and processes of elections **\[1\] \[3\]**. For example, the Delian Project is a non\-governmental organisation dedicated to helping jurisdictions implement positive change in the democratic voting process. Managing Director, Dr Allan Best describes how engagement with the EPO has prompted the Delian Project to place greater emphasis on electoral psychology in the course of its work: “ *one of the biggest ways that \[Bruter\] and \[Harrison\]’s research has really opened the eyes of senior individuals in election management bodies is the fact that in EMBs we tend to look more at the logistics of an election as opposed to the science and emotion of an election. This is critical. The fact that they have been able to bring analytical and critical\-based research, atmospherics that actually let us understand what is the target audience, what are they looking to glean from an election, how do we increase voter turnout, and more importantly how do we make a successful election that actually is relevant to the voter in a way that is human, that is emotive, that is actually something that caters to them as opposed to something that is an exercise in logistics*” **\[E\]**. 

 **Influence on electoral observation practices in the Falkland Islands** 

 This work has also had an effect on electoral observation missions. It was put into practice when the Delian Project served as an election observer for the independence referendum in the Falkland Islands. Using questions developed by the EPO **\[1\] \[2\]**, the Delian Project was able to gain insights into the unique emotion of an independence referendum, even among a very small population of 1,600. Best has since said that the answers to those questions on voters’ electoral experience were “ *very useful to us to understand that we have to be very cognisant of emotions*” **\[E\]**. 

 **Establishment of new awards fostering and rewarding best practice** 

 Bruter and Harrison have shared best practice in election processes **\[1\] \[2\]** with election management bodies \(EMBs\) through the International Centre for Parliamentary Studies \(ICPS\), which promotes effective policymaking and good governance through capacity\-building and specialises in electoral affairs **\[E\]**. Arvind Venkataramana, former CEO of the ICPS, has attested to the usefulness of the underpinning research in helping EMBs to improve voter satisfaction specifically. According to Venkataramana, “ *where \[Bruter and Harrison\] make a significant impact is to improve the overall voter experience, which, in turn, results in greater voter turnout, which is a success for election management bodies*.” EMBs have found the research “ *very useful to implement strategies that they’ve been wanting to implement for a while, especially to attract first\-time voters, to improve access for disabled voters, adapt new technologies in their regions, and also they’ve used their insights to design ballot papers more innovatively*” **\[E\]**. 

 After Bruter presented findings on electoral psychology and electoral ergonomics at their annual international conferences, the ICPS created four new categories in its Electoral Stakeholder Awards, to better recognise outstanding work by EMBs. The new award categories were in Electoral Ergonomics, Citizens Engagement, First\-Time Voters, and Accessibility. These have been bestowed every year since December 2013, encouraging greater innovation among EMBs in trying to improve the overall voter experience. Venkataramana has identified the Electoral Ergonomics category, in particular, as being among those to receive the most \- and most creative \- nominations **\[E\]**. Bruter served on the awards committee until 2019. 

 **Influence on the production of a new television series** 

 Findings from the EPO research **\[2\] \[4\]** have also informed the writing of a new Apple Television spy series. *Life Undercover*, starring Brie Larson, dramatises a fictional French election, set against the background of an extremist threat and electoral disruption. A production team research assistant discovered the Bruter and Harrison research and invited them to a meeting in Los Angeles. Briefing the team of nine writers and producers, Bruter and Harrison offered expert input on the dramatic scenario, including insights on voter psychology. Megan Martin, the lead writer, says: ""\[ *Bruter\] and \[Harrison\]'s insights into the transmission of extremist ideology, and the psychology of voters were invaluable...As the writers continued to shape story lines, \[Bruter\] and \[Harrison\]'s time with us grounded the narrative in ways that continued to surprise and impress me*"" **\[F\]**. Production has been halted due to the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 **Helping to give first\-time voters and cognitively disabled voters a voice in the UK, South Africa, and Australia** 

 EPO research has also been used in the course of initiatives intended to give first\-time voters and those with learning and cognitive disabilities a greater voice in electoral processes in the UK, South Africa, and Australia **\[1\] \[3\]**. Since 2019, Bruter and Harrison have worked on the All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Votes at 16 to help it build a case for the extension of the voting franchise to 16 and 17\-year\-olds, with a first report published in 2019. Similarly, since 2016, Bruter and Harrison have been working with the South African Independent Electoral Commission \(IEC\) to test pilot measures intended to make the electoral experience of first\-time voters feel rewarding and more likely to motivate sustained electoral engagement **\[G\]**. The work involved collaboration with South African youth organisations and one of the IEC Commissioners. The IEC subsequently began running pilot information campaigns in a selection of electoral wards in August 2016. 

 In parallel, EPO organised two policy labs \(in 2018 and 2019\) in collaboration with the Australian Electoral Commission \(AEC\) and the state\-level commissions of South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Here, research findings focusing on the experience of voters with mental health issues were shared with commissioners and a team of 20\+ divisional heads at the AEC. EPO and AEC organised a joint observation of the 2019 Federal Election, focused on the experience of disabled and special\-needs voters, in particular. Bruter and Harrison worked with staff in polling stations dedicated to accommodating disabled voters **\[H\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Penny’s research focus is on using Creative Writing to support social justice. In 2015, she worked on ‘ *Seeds Of The Future’.* She ran workshops with men, women and girls from the Somali diaspora in London, gathering testimony about how they had accepted a transition away from FGM, in order to support a wider community refusal to cut girls. Between 2016 and 2019, she ran *The Xenophobia Project.* This project, in collaboration with the Scalabrini Centre in Cape Town South Africa, worked with migrants to harness testimony about their experiences of xenophobic violence in South Africa. This testimony was then used as the basis of an expressive arts workshops with local teens, and finally Scalabrini staff were trained to use the expressive arts approach in their own workshops. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Penny’s research focuses on using expressive arts for social justice. At the core of her research is the investigation of how creative writing and dramatherapy can form a synthesis to offer practical solutions to social justice issues in Africa and deliver social change. 

 In 2014, Dr Penny \(then, Lecturer\) was awarded a Winston Churchill Memorial Trust Grant \(Grant 1\) to conduct research on whether the synthesis of creative writing and dramatherapy can be used as a tool to empower mothers in their refusal of Female Genital Cutting \(FGC\) for their daughters. The research findings showed that the integration of the 2 disciplines is an effective methodology to achieve social change \(Ref. 2\). 

 In 2015, Dr Penny employed dramatherapy and creative writing to gain insight into the commitment of Somali men, women, and adolescent girls in London to move away from FGC \(Ref.1\). The research methodology used was vested in the creative arts and therapy with the aim of having a process that takes into account the sensitive nature of the topic but also offers an effective way to gather testimonials from the parties involved. The distinct use of dramatherapy and creative practice as research synthesis allowed for these testimonials to emerge and worked as a tool for social change, activism, and healing. 

 Dr Penny’s scholarship is defined by this research synthesis, and she has used it to collect research findings to which she would have otherwise been denied access due to language barriers, illiteracy, or cultural differences. Her research methodology provides practical solutions to the challenging communication of narratives that centre on moving away from FGC and other issues of social justice. 

 Dr Penny’s most recent research project investigated in more detail whether expressive arts can also be used to change xenophobic attitudes among young people in South Africa. The research built on her existing body of work on how the synthesis of creative writing and dramatherapy can provide effective and concrete solutions to issues of social justice \(Ref.1; Ref.2; Ref.3.; Ref. 4\). 

 Xenophobia in South Africa is rife. Because many migrants are undocumented it is difficult to get exact data on the prevalence of the attacks, but in 1 small town alone, Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, during 2015, over 500 people were displaced and over 300 shops and homes looted or destroyed through xenophobic violence. The South Africa government is widely perceived as taking very little initiative to combat xenophobic violence, and is often accused of fuelling violence through the public statements of ministers and public figures. 

 Since the first democratic elections in 1994, there has been a steady flow of migrants into South Africa, fleeing war, drought and poverty and attracted by South Africa’s relative stability and wealth.  A 2011 census calculated that there are approximately 2,200,000 migrants in the country \(4.2% of the population\). The unemployment rate in South Africa currently stands at 25.5%. The combination of poverty, unemployment and competition for resources with people perceived as strangers, has a deeply negative effect on integration in South Africa, and in urban centres in particular. 

 The research objectives were: 

-  To gather stories from migrants about their experiences. 

-  To run workshops with teenagers, based on the migrant testimony, and assess how impactful this approach was. 

-  To train staff in this approach. 

 Dr Penny’s research found that adolescents reported that when they were introduced to a story\-based approach they felt they developed a real understanding of the issues faced by migrants whereas when they were ‘taught’ about migrant issues using a formal approach, they disengaged and felt little empathy for the migrants. The migrants themselves reported that being able to talk about their experiences using the expressive arts approach was therapeutic and beneficial.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **The Xenophobia Project:** 

 There is a deep divide between \(undocumented\) migrants and the other inhabitants in South Africa which often leaves migrants excluded **.** Migrants are denied access to the same level of protection from the government as others. The Government does very little to combat xenophobia, and ministers and public figures tend to fuel violence with xenophobic and derogatory statements. 

 The Scalabrini Centre is a human rights organisation in Cape Town. The organisation is committed to alleviating poverty and promoting development in the Western Cape area of South Africa while fostering integration between migrants, refugees and South Africans. This integration is very difficult in the face of a government rhetoric that often seeks to deflect from failure to deliver and corruption by promoting an anti\-migrant agenda. 

 One of their programmes is Unite\!, a youth programme which is attended by 281 young people and unites students from 6 different local high schools to build social cohesion and transformation in South African society \(E2\). 

 Scalabrini needed Dr Penny’s research because they wanted a testimony they could use for Unite\! but they also wanted to be able to engage with this testimony with young people in a more inclusive and effective way. Dr Penny worked with Scalabrini to gather the testimony, and then trained them in how to work with the testimony using an expressive arts approach. The workshops used both creative therapeutic writing and dramatherapy to allow the participants to explore their memories in a way that was not exploitative, and that allowed them to revisit sometimes very traumatic life events in a contained and safe space. The Centre confirms that because of Dr Penny’s distinct use of expressive arts, the participants were able “to express themselves in ways they would not have been able to otherwise. In this way, \[Scalabrini\] were able to map what they have gone through” \(E1\). 

 In the migrant phase, in April 2017, Dr Penny worked with 12 migrants from the DRC, Rwanda, Somalia, and Zimbabwe to create a set of testimonials about their experiences that could be used for Unite\!. She delivered 5 workshops for men only and 5 workshops for women only, and worked on an individual basis with each participant to help them to write their story. The Scalabrini Centre notes that this phase “was very psychologically beneficial for the participants in the workshop to be able to share a space with others who had walked a similar journey. They were able to find their communalities and share the hardships they had endured” \(E1\). 

 After that, Dr Penny ran pilot workshops with Unite\! in order to explore how most effectively to share the material, using creative writing and dramatherapy. She worked for 5 days with 15 young people. She conducted staff training programmes in using the material, working with 10 staff members over a 2\-day period, and collated a resource to be referenced when using the materials in Scalabrini programmes. The Centre says, “The techniques we were taught allowed us to be much more creative and imaginative \[and\] Dr Penny left us with a detailed manual about the activities which we continue to use to date” \(E1\). 

 The migrants described the experience of taking part in the workshops as positive and cathartic. 1 of the participants fed back regarding one of the group activities: “It was really good for me to write the letter. It sorted out some things that confused me that I needed to say even though it bought pain. It has made me feel more peaceful.” 

 There has been a ripple effect in the organisation following Dr Penny’s work. The adult staff are using her ideas across the organisation in their different programmes. Meanwhile, the young people who attended the workshops have gone out into 6 different local high schools in order to peer\-facilitate the same activities with which Dr Penny has provided them \(E1\). 

 Dr Penny has impacted on Scalabrini’s strategy by giving them an arsenal of tools that they can use both to strengthen their existing programmes and to have wider outreach. 

 **Seeds of the Future:** 

 Midaye Somali Development Network is a user\-led charity that is focused on supporting ethnic minority communities. The grassroots community organisation is deeply embedded in the ethnic minority communities in West London. Midaye is committed to the well\-being, empowerment and making a tangible difference in the lives of individuals, families and communities and to building bridges that strengthen integration to the wider society. 

 Midaye needed Dr Penny’s research for FGM prevention. They needed a way to reach non\-English speaking Somali migrants with the message that it was becoming acceptable in the community to transition away from FGM. These workshops also combined creative therapeutic writing and dramatherapy. It was particularly important to have a safely held space in opening up a discussion of FGM because there is so much secrecy around the topic within the community. It was also important to be extremely sensitive in how the workshops were run, as a non\-Somali, because the community has had the previous experience, when attempting to engage with safeguarding authorities about FGM, of being told for many years that FGM was a ‘cultural practice’ and could be dealt with by the Somali community internally. This attitude then transitioned into a very heavy\-handed approach \(from around 2014\) in which a much more serious commitment was made by the UK government to mobilise domestic and international efforts to end FGM. But the intrusive nature of this more vigorous approach \(such as questioning at airports and mandatory reporting by GPs\) have sometimes made Somalis feel as if their whole culture is under attack. 

 Dr Penny worked with Midaye for approximately 2 years in total, between 2015 and 2016. She ran workshops with women, then men, then girls who had not been cut. Each set of workshops ran for 1 working week \(5 workshop in each week\). Dr Penny also met individually with participants to write their stories after which she podcasted them and uploaded them to Sound Cloud, using actor’s voices for anonymity. 

 Covid\-19 has brought to light once again the various inequalities vulnerable communities face when hit by health, economic, and social disasters. While all BAME communities have been disproportionately affected, the social issues facing Somalis in London have made it very difficult to cope. 80% of British Somalis live in social housing with multi\-generational families and without gardens or balconies, and many families with school\-aged children have low access to computers and tablets that are needed for home\-learning \(E3\). 

 Dr Penny had aimed to go back to the Midaye Somali Development Network in 2020 to investigate how the impact had matured in the last 4 to 5 years. However, due to the disparity in risk faced by the Somali community, Dr Penny is unable to press for access. If anything, these high levels of inequality make Dr Penny’s work all the more important, as it demonstrates how practical measures can be taken to set in motion important mitigation measures.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by the School of Economics at the University of Kent resulted in recommendations to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization \(FAO\) to provide internationally comparative statistics on family farming. As a result, FAO created the digital ‘Family Farming Knowledge Platform’, providing statistics and policy information to governments, NGOs, and farmers. The statistics are helping to improve policies on family farming. 

 Furthermore, research by the School enabled the implementation of two new policies in Kosovo to lift the poorest farmers out of poverty. The first provides grants to help farmers with commercialisation. The second advances a bottom\-up, LEADER\-type approach to rural development, supporting investment in human capital and cooperation projects to mitigate rural out\-migration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The body of research that underpins the impact outlined in this case study was undertaken by Professor Davidova and Professor Bailey \(both Professors of Agricultural Economics at Kent\), together with PhD student Alberto Zanni and co\-authors from other UK universities. Davidova is a world\-leading expert on policy for small farmers in European countries. Her research and the resulting impact are motivated by the key contribution of small family farmers to food security and the management of natural resources. 

 **R3** investigated the subjective determinants of farmers’ participation in agricultural markets in Central European countries, characterised by large semi\-subsistence sectors that yield meagre incomes for those involved. Access to technical advisory services and market information were the two factors significant to all sample farmers despite their heterogeneity. While structured information on larger farm businesses is available, data on smaller family farmers is insufficient. This information barrier prevents the more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by small family farmers in their market integration, and thus the implementation of evidence\-based policies. The findings concerning imperfect information **\[R3\]** formed the basis of Davidova’s policy recommendations to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization \(FAO\) **\[R4\]** to improve statistics in order to monitor the development of family farms and their policy needs, and contributed to the eventual implementation of a digital platform that enables knowledge exchange. 

 **R1**, **R2**, **R5** and **R6**, in turn, formed the basis for two new policies that were implemented in Kosovo to improve the economic viability of family farmers. **R2** recommended the introduction of policy support to facilitate increased market integration of semi\-subsistence farms in order to bring longer\-term welfare benefits and help mitigate short\-run costs and risks. **R2** suggested that, in order to be effective, this support should be conditional on measures to increase the human capital of beneficiaries. **R6** provided further evidence that investment in human capital should be prioritised. Employing a dynamic model, it formulated two hypotheses concerning the incremental output effect of family labour: \(1\) the motivation hypothesis, based on the lower monitoring costs associated with family members in comparison to hired workers; and \(2\) the management capabilities deterioration hypothesis, linked to the restricted pool of family labour, which may not possess the required skills. The empirical application showed that on low technical\-efficiency farms the management capabilities deterioration effect offsets any positive effects of loyalty of family labour, calling for the training of family labour. 

 However, improving the wellbeing of small family farmers depends not only on agricultural policy, but also on rural development in areas that host these farmers in order to mitigate pushed rural out\-migration. The research on Kosovo revealed a significant adverse effect of rural out\-migration on farm technical efficiency **\[R5\]**. **R1** employed a discrete choice experiment in an underdeveloped region of rural Slovenia, which shares a common economic history with Kosovo, to provide understanding on how to manage rural labour adjustments in a country in transition. Results revealed that when faced with a choice of jobs and residence, individuals consider not only the wage, but also non\-pecuniary factors, in particular service infrastructure. These results show that policy\-makers should be informed about inhabitants’ preferences in order to mitigate out\-migration by designing policies that achieve a better distribution of service infrastructure across the territory.

 **Global Impact on Information Provision enabling Improved Policies on Family Farming** 

 The United Nations recognised the key contributions of family farmers and the need of adequate policy response on a global scale by declaring 2014 as the International Year of Family Farming. Professor Davidova’s longstanding research expertise on small semi\-subsistence farmers led to her being invited to contribute to global UN events. Davidova’s Background Report, commissioned by the UN FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia **\[R4\]**, drove awareness in the FAO Member Nations of the need for information on family farming and policy impact assessment. The report was presented on 11\-12 December 2013 in Brussels at the FAO Regional Dialogue for Europe and Central Asia on ‘Family Farming: Working Towards a Strategic Approach to Promote Food Security and Nutrition’, where Davidova acted as keynote speaker **\[a\]**. The meeting had a wide reach, involving around 100 stakeholders from 27 countries, including representatives of governments, UN, NGOs, and farmers' organisations **\[b\]**. FAO uploaded a summary of the report, emphasising that it ‘aims at facilitating the Regional Dialogue for Europe and Central Asia, and the preparation of the outcome document’ **\[c\]**. 

 One of the policy recommendations in the report was for FAO to provide internationally comparative statistics on family farming, and to regularly assess whether policies are conducive to family farmers. Subsequently, in October 2014, at the Global Dialogue on Family Farming, summarising the lessons learnt from the Regional Dialogues, FAO presented the decision to launch a digital ‘Family Farming Knowledge Platform’ to ‘facilitate policy discussions, policy design and decision making by providing easy online access to sources and fostering knowledge and information dissemination’ **\[d\]**. The Platform was launched in 2015, and provides a wide range of resources and statistics to governments, NGOs and farmers. 

 **Implementing Better Policies on Family Farming in Kosovo to Improve Commercialisation** 

 As a result of Davidova longstanding research on semi\-subsistence family farmers in Europe, as well as her expertise in working with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs \(MAFRD\) in Kosovo **\[e\]**, she was invited by the FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia to contribute to the project ‘Capacity Development of MAFRD in Kosovo to Improve Commercialisation of Small and Family Farmers \(TCP/KOS/: 3602\)’ **\[f\]**. The policy recommendations stemming from the underpinning research were presented by Davidova at a stakeholders’ workshop in MAFRD in December 2018, involving Ministry and Agricultural Development Agency officials, farmers’ organisations, NGOs, and foreign donors, with a call for actions **\[g\]**. Subsequently, Davidova and Bailey organised a policy workshop at the University of Kent, with the participation of FAO, representatives of MAFRD, the World Bank, and other organisations to discuss the practical implementation of research recommendations. 

 During the follow\-up three\-day bilateral meeting with the Permanent Secretary of MAFRD and the Chief Executive of Agricultural Development Agency in Kosovo, an agreement was reached to introduce two new policies to help overcome the low level of market integration of family farmers and to generate a bottom\-up LEADER approach to rural development **\[h\]**. These policies have already been implemented. The first new policy provides for start\-up grants to semi\-subsistence farmers designed to promote market engagement through increase in their assets, accompanied by training. This is a major policy improvement, since it lifts asset\-poor households out of poverty. The second policy is related to rural development measures, designed to curb rural out\-migration. In the first year of implementation, around 600 grants were disbursed. The implementation of the LEADER approach supported 12 Local Action Groups, involving the local population with a focus on upskilling and developing cooperation projects **\[i\]**. 

 The research impact on implementation of these new policies has relevance for countries in the wider FAO Europe and Central Asia region, which are populated by small family farms facing high transaction costs to increase their market engagement **\[j\]**.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Safety is of paramount importance to the airline industry, a worldwide sector worth around USD838,000,000,000 in 2019 and carrying 4,540,000,000 passengers a year. Despite being thought to be fully understood and controlled, a series of accidents caused by ice accreting on wings of aircraft certified as safe to fly, has recently led to a reassessment of how icing is modelled and understood. An important aspect of this has been predicting how the splashing of large droplets can significantly alter both the amount and location of icing. UEA research into droplet impacts has increased understanding of these phenomena, fed into icing prediction codes used as part of aircraft design and compliance, and contributed to changes in international airline regulations that have had an estimated benefit of USD528,900,000. The UEA research has had a direct **economic impact** through the improved performance of AeroTex, the company that developed the icing codes, with consequent **impact on public safety** whilst flying. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Fundamental research led by **Dr Richard Purvis** in the School of Mathematical Sciences at UEA has considered many aspects of droplet impacts and splashing, with a focus on how such events can influence ice formation on an aircraft. The underpinning research uses a combination of numerical and analytical techniques to gain an understanding of what happens when a supercooled large water droplet hits a moving object. The research was partly supported by an EPSRC grant to Purvis \(2007\-2009\). 

 The research into large droplet impacts and ice formation started as part of an international effort to improve aircraft safety after a series of incidents led to a re\-evaluation of the dangers of aircraft icing. The objective throughout was to better understand the splashing process, and thereby inform the empirical models of splashing that are now included in icing prediction software. The added complications of larger droplets, such as droplet distortion and, especially, of splashing meant the predictions of existing trusted models were wrong. They significantly over\-predicted the rate of ice growth and did not predict ice formation as far back on the wing as seen in practice. Initial attempts to include simple empirical models failed to significantly improve the predictions. Since 2003, much research effort worldwide has been focussed towards understanding the fundamental problems in large droplet impacts and how they relate to icing. At UEA, this has included studies of droplet dynamics ahead of and during splashing, and of liquid impacts onto rigid, flexible and porous surfaces, to understand and predict splashing, as well as to investigate how splashing might be controlled. The work has also involved collaboration within the UK, including mathematical modelling at UCL, and experimental work at Cranfield. 

 The main underpinning research includes using a Volume\-of\-Fluid numerical technique to investigate which parameters influence a droplet splashing onto a thin water film \(R1\). This technique predicts how much water is splashed for a variety of droplet sizes, impact speeds and impact angles. Additionally, it demonstrates that much of the splashed water is displaced from the relatively warm water lying on the wing rather than the colder water originating in the droplet. This finding has implications for the speed of ice growth; previous tentative splash models had assumed that all the splashed water would be cold, a deficiency that has now been corrected. 

 Despite having many applications beyond just icing, little was understood about the mathematics of droplet impacts onto water films. A theoretical study \(R2\) considered an analytical asymptotic small\-time approach, capturing the initial behaviour as a large droplet enters a thin water layer. This work validates the numerical approaches and offers an estimate of the initial impact pressure that may erode any surface coating of the wing that could prevent ice build\-up. 

 Advances in high\-speed photography have revealed the complex and important influence of air close to droplet impacts. Papers \(R3, R4 and R5\) develop models of air cushioning in droplet impacts, focusing on the entrapment of air bubbles as droplets approach both dry and wetted surfaces. Considering the local behaviour near touchdown, coupled viscous\-inviscid models were developed by exploiting the large density and viscosity differences between air and water. The research identified the important parameter ranges for air cushioning, and these compare favourably to experimental measurements \(R6\). 

 Passive anti\-icing systems are currently in development that use flexible or porous surfaces to prevent or control ice formation. Recent research \(R7 and R8\) has focussed on understanding and predicting impact onto such complex substrates, demonstrating how minor changes in the substrate can substantially change the splashing dynamics, and hence any subsequent icing.

In\-flight aircraft icing occurs when super\-cooled water droplets suspended in clouds impact upon wings, and other forward\-facing components of an aircraft, and then turn into ice. Significant ice build\-up must be prevented, as it can quickly lead to a loss of lift and subsequently control of an aircraft, with serious safety implications. Aircraft icing was thought to be fully understood until the total loss of an ATR72 American Eagle flight 4184 in 1994 at Roselawn which killed all 68 people on board. Icing was found to have caused the accident, despite the aircraft being certified as safe to fly in the weather conditions of the time, and the anti\-icing systems being fully functional. 

 The aircraft accident report found that: 

 *“following exposure to a complex and severe icing environment including droplets **much larger than those specified in certification criteria for the airplane**, and during a descending turn immediately after the flaps were raised, the ailerons abruptly deflected in the right\-wing\-down direction, the autopilot disconnected, and the airplane entered an abrupt roll to the right, which was not fully corrected before the airplane impacted the ground”.* 

 **\[corroborating source A \- page 252\]** 

 It was ultimately revealed that, while the existing certification and icing models were effective in conditions with clouds of small droplets of around 20 microns, they were not valid for supercooled large droplets \(SLD\) which can be up to 1500 microns. 

 *“Weather observed in the area of the accident appears to have included supercooled water droplets in the size range of about 40 to 400 microns.”* 

 **\[corroborating source A \- page 254\]** 

 Although rare, this is not an isolated incident. A similar fate befell Aero Caribbean flight 883 in 2010 where icing caused by large droplets was again the primary cause of the accident, again with the loss of 68 lives. This discovered threat to air safety resulted in a large joint international effort, led by NASA, ONERA and QinetiQ, to improve models of ice formation, and to update the aircraft certification requirements. **\[corroborating source B\]** 

 A key part of that process was to understand the dynamics of large droplet impacts and splashing, in order to understand why existing models could not accurately predict the rate of ice growth, or the location of ice forming on a wing. Richard Purvis was involved in this response, with the research described above providing important insights and understanding of droplet impacts and their role in ice formation which has helped to improve design tools. 

 **AeroTex** is an SME offering consultancy to the aircraft industry in the field of aircraft icing, including ice prediction, icing protection and design. They develop icing prediction codes and help to design and certify ice protection systems. Whilst details of their customer base are confidential, they have confirmed that it includes: 

 “*five aircraft manufacturers, five Tier 1 suppliers and two national research agencies”* 

 **\[corroborating source C\]** 

 Subsequent to being at UEA, Peter Hicks spent a year working at AeroTex helping them develop their numerical models. Hicks' research and expertise in aircraft icing was developed during his postdoctoral position at UEA, making him ideally placed to carry out this work for AeroTex. 

 UEA research on large droplet impacts and splashing has improved overall understanding and offered crucial insight into an important, and previously little understood, aspect of aircraft icing. AeroTex have confirmed that the research: 

 “*has enhanced AeroTex expertise by informing and improving our knowledge of splashing. As a result, we can offer ice prediction and icing protection design software, which enables us to compete effectively against our rivals, including ADSE in the Netherlands and Ansys \(a global software company\).”* 

 **\[corroborating source C\]** 

 They also confirm that: 

 “*the mathematical research into droplet impacts and splashing carried out at UEA has helped to inform our knowledge of large droplet dynamics and splashing and that, along with a range of other experimental and theoretical investigations, it has contributed to an improved understanding of the role of splashing in SLD icing. The knowledge of SLD is now routinely used as part of the design activities for our clients, helping them to meet the stringent certification requirements which are in place and therefore to maintain a high level of safety within the aerospace* industry *.”*

 Airline safety is a vital aspect of a commercial airline sector that is worth USD838,000,000,000 globally. Alongside the stark human cost of air accidents, there are also enormous economic consequences, both for the companies involved and associated sectors such as insurance, following any aircraft accident. In response to the spate of SLD icing related accidents in aircraft certified as safe to fly, the international aviation safety agencies \(Federal Aviation Authority – FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency – EASA\) introduced additional specifications to include demonstrating that new aircraft can operate safely in freezing drizzle or rain \(SLD conditions\), known as Appendix O. Appendix O replaced Appendix C, which had no mention of SLD conditions. 

 *“Appendix O consists of two parts. Part I defines Appendix O as a description of supercooled large drop \(SLD\) icing conditions … Part II defines ice accretions used to show compliance with CS\-25 specification.”* 

 **\[corroborating source D \- page 298\]** 

 The FAA note that: 

 *“The estimated cost of the rule is USD61,300,000, and the benefits are an estimated USD528,900,000 .... Affected parties include airplane manufacturers, engine* manufacturers *and operation of affected equipment.”* 

 **\[corroborating source E – page 2\]** 

 AeroTex confirm that the UEA research findings: 

 *“were part of a larger contribution which led to a revision of FAA and EASA certification criteria to account for icing* with *large droplets.”* 

 **\[corroborating source C\]** 

 The EASA guidelines state that: 

 *“CS 25.1420 requires that the aeroplane be able to either safely exit following the detection of any or specifically Appendix O icing conditions, or to safely operate without restrictions in the icing* environment *represented in Appendix O.”* 

 **\[corroborating source F – page 39\]** 

 The financial value of the UEA research to AeroTex is confirmed in the supporting letter from their Aircraft Icing Consultant: 

 “*I estimate that our expertise in large droplet behaviour and its influence on icing has a financial value* *of around an additional GBP40,000 of increased revenue a year to our company. AeroTex has developed a reputation as an accomplished business in relation to SLD and the UEA input to our research activities certainly played a part in this.”* 

 **\[corroborating source C\]** 

 This corresponds to around 10% of AeroTex’s total revenue. **\[corroborating source G\]** 

 In summary, this case study demonstrates that by developing a mathematical understanding of droplet impacts, UEA research has helped AeroTex, and thereby the wider aircraft industry, to improve models of aircraft icing, and ultimately improve air safety.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 UEA research by Terry Haydn has contributed to a shift in public and policy discourse around pupil behaviour in English schools. Haydn’s research challenged DfE and Ofsted claims that behaviour was ‘satisfactory or better’ in over 99.7% of schools. His results influenced the recommendations of the Bennett Review on the impact of behaviour on pupils’ learning.  Teacher\-development tools incorporating the Haydn Scale are widely used resources for assessing and mitigating school behaviour challenges and have been used in training thousands of teachers in the UK and internationally. 
","
 2. Underpinning Research 

 **Identifying the extent of behaviour problems in schools** 

 The ability of pupils to learn in an environment free from disruption significantly improves their attainment and the morale of their teachers. In England, government publications had consistently claimed that poor behaviour was not a significant problem in schools \(Patten, 1994; the Steer Report, 2005/2009\). As recently as 2012, the Department for Education \(DfE\) and Ofsted claimed that behaviour was ‘satisfactory or better’ in over 99.7% of schools in England. UEA research by Terry Haydn was the first body of research to challenge this view. Through a survey of 250 trainee teachers and interviews with over 150 teachers in English schools, he demonstrated that pupil behaviour was, to some extent, a problem in most English schools \(R2, R6\). 

 **The Haydn Scale as response, and use in teacher development** 

 In 2002 Haydn introduced an instrument, now commonly referred to as *the **Haydn Scale** following media coverage**, to describe and assess classroom climate \(R5\). The scale, based on extensive classroom observation in English schools, describes classroom climate on a continuum of ten levels, from being ideally conducive to learning \(level 10\) to one in which the right of pupils to learn, and as a result their attainment, is severely inhibited by poor behaviour \(level 1\). Each level is defined by a descriptor, addressed in the second person to a teacher, with a short vignette of corresponding classroom dynamics designed to resonate with the experiences of teachers and school leaders. The descriptors capture the balance of emphasis on ‘control’ factors \(at lower levels\) versus ‘learning’ factors \(at higher levels\), and the implications of that level for pupil outcomes and the teacher’s enjoyment of their job. The scale was the first to bridge research and practice by providing an instrument enabling teachers and student teachers to consider reflectively the extent to which the teacher is in control of the classroom, and able to create and sustain a working atmosphere that optimises pupil learning \(R1\). 

 **Using the Haydn Scale to generate teacher testimonies about classroom climate** 

 Haydn’s more recent research \(R2, R3, R4\) used the Haydn Scale to elicit ‘teacher testimonies’, in which teachers report their experiences of addressing common problems relating to pupil behaviour. Haydn’s website presents coded teacher testimonies from 150 interviews with teachers \(R6\), and provides a resource enabling student\- and newly\-qualified teachers’ access to both the views of experienced teachers, and the strategies they use, to establish a working atmosphere in the classroom which is conducive to pupils’ learning. 

 **What the Haydn Scale and teacher testimonies tell us about behaviour in schools** 

 As well as radically changing perceptions of the extent to which behaviour is a problem in English schools, the research provides insights into the complex factors contributing to deficits in classroom climate and their influence on pupil attainment, teacher wellbeing, and morale. Teacher testimonies from the research give insights into ‘in\-school variation’ in classroom climate. By detailing the varying and subtle relationships between teaching skills, subject knowledge, learners and contexts, the testimonies illustrate why some teachers are able to secure higher levels on the Haydn scale than others, even when working with the same pupils. The testimonies also provide usable insights into teachers’ views on how teachers get better at managing pupil behaviour.

 4. Details of the impact: 

 **1. Influencing policymaking in the UK:** The landmark Bennett Review, published in 2017 \(S2\), was commissioned by the DfE to review the impact of standards of behaviour on pupils’ learning, and staff satisfaction in English schools. Bennett, Lead Advisor to the DfE on behaviour, invited Haydn to be an expert contributor to a series of DfE meetings. The Bennett Review cites 8 Haydn publications, including R1 and R2, and directly quotes 922 words of Haydn’s work \(R2\) to support Bennett’s proposals for improving school learning cultures by addressing behaviour. Bennett says: *‘To emphasise the case that there is a substantial opportunity to improve behaviour in schools, it is useful to quote extensively from Professor Terry Haydn* \(2014\) \(R2\) *below who made a careful exploration of both the appearance and the lived reality of classrooms in the UK’* \(S2\). 

 \[redacted text\] writes about the role Haydn’s research played in shaping the review: 

 *‘The report draws in particular on \[Haydn’s\] 2014 paper* \(R2\). *The research questioned the positive picture which had previously been painted of standards of behaviour in English schools and suggested that behaviour was a much more significant and widespread problem than was generally acknowledged at the time. The research contributed to the decision of the DfE to look into the issue of behaviour in schools... Since the publication of the reports, there is now a much more general acceptance of the importance of behaviour as an issue for schools to address, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to pupil wellbeing and attainment by deficits in classroom climate.’* \(S1\) 

 The Bennett Review has had far\-reaching consequences for policymaking on behaviour management in English schools. In 2014, Ofsted requested a copy of Haydn’s research \(S3\) and Haydn was subsequently invited to be part of the DfE commissioned review of behaviour in schools. Ofsted’s most recent policy document on behaviour, ‘HMCI commentary: Managing behaviour research’ \(2019\) cites the Bennett Review at length and marks a radical shift from their earlier \(2012\) statements on behaviour in schools. 

 **2. Developing teacher education to improve pupil behaviour: ** The Haydn scale is the most widely used instrument for understanding the issues of classroom climate and pupil behaviour in England \(S5\). Haydn’s research is adopted by many university\- and school\-based providers of initial teacher education. It has been presented to the 99 university members of the Universities’ Council for the Education of Teachers \(UCET\), its Executive Director stating *‘the research has been shared widely – and utilised – by HEI based educators since it was disseminated to them through UCET forums and the annual UCET teacher education conference. The 10\-point scale has had a positive impact on how classroom management is covered in ITE programmes and as a result, how it is dealt with in schools’* \(S5\). In October 2020, the National Association of School Based Teacher Trainers \(NASBTT\) selected Haydn’s research for inclusion in the online Routledge School Based Teacher Training Hub, commissioned ‘to provide trainee teachers and their mentors with focussed, accessible, evidence\-informed guidance that will help develop skills and confidence for successful classroom practice’. The online hub serves NASBTT’s 200 member providers and over 10,000 trainees. It is complemented by the book ‘Secondary Behaviour Management: The Essentials’ \(2019, edited by Oberholzer for Routledge\).  Both of these training resources present Haydn’s research, initially published in R1, to trainee teachers, mentors and teacher educators \(S8\). 

 Many thousands of student teachers have been inducted into the use of the scale in face\-to\-face invited lectures in ITE institutions since 2010 \(S5\), and the research instrument and teacher testimonies are used by many partnership schools when students go out on placement.  Feedback from institutions where Haydn’s lectures present the Haydn Scale shows a high proportion of attending trainee teachers find the research and supporting teacher testimonies to be useful. At the University of Oxford \(2016\), for example, of the 107 trainees making an evaluative comment on Haydn’s PGCE lecture and resources, over 94% considered them at least ‘valuable’, with 73% considering them ‘very valuable’ \(S6\). Trainee teachers at University College London \(2019\) stated the lecture and resources ‘ *really resonated with myself and everyone around me*’ and ‘ *put me at ease with the very tricky and daunting prospect of classroom management*’ \(S7\). The Haydn Scale improved trainees’ understanding of the complex judgements needed to establish good working atmosphere \(‘ *not just binary choices’*\), raised aspirations \(‘ *given me some goals I’d like to achieve*’\) and supported action for improving teaching \(‘ *something I will use when observing classrooms’*\) \(S7\). School mentors use the scale in observation/lesson evaluation practices, remarking on the impact of the Haydn Scale for overcoming ‘ *trainees’ anxieties about class management*’ through ‘ *discussion of the levels’* \(S7\). 

 Several Course Directors of leading Initial Teacher Education providers and behaviour experts attest to the usefulness and impact of the research \(S4, S5\), for example: 

 **UCL:  ‘...for more than a ten year period… he* \[Haydn\] *has reached 600\-700 student teachers each year, just as they begin teaching in schools across London and SE England. So, his research and findings have reached about 6,000 secondary teachers, and upwards of 300 schools....* \[The\] *research and the 10 point scale he used in the research has been very well received by the student teachers, in their evaluations and has had real impact in enhancing their classroom management, thereby improving teaching and the learning of young people, often in socially/economically disadvantaged circumstances. Terry’s research and dissemination has thus contributed to social justice for young people in London and beyond.’* \(S5\) 

 **Oxford:  ‘Terry Haydn has delivered an annual lecture on classroom management to our PGCE cohort \(n. 190 each year\) for the past 11 years. The lecture is based on the research outlined in Terry‘s book ‘Managing pupil behaviour: working to improve classroom climate’ and the 10 point scale on which the research was based. The lectures have been exceptionally well received by our student teachers and the evaluations of the sessions have been consistently positive. The 10 point scale instrument is therefore highly likely to have influenced the thinking and practice in classroom management of over 2000 student teachers from the University of Oxford. The vast majority of these student teachers now work in state education and many are in senior positions in schools.’* \(S5\) 

 Attesting to how the Haydn Scale and teacher testimonies evince recognition in those who teach in classrooms, \[redacted text\] \(Teachers’ TV, behaviour consultant and trainer\) commented on how they promote reflection, discussion and action relating to classroom climate: ‘ *I have used the scale and teacher comments arising out of the research in my own professional development work with teachers and student teachers. The scale unfailingly intrigues and interests those involved and is an excellent resource for exploring why some teachers become better than others at managing pupil behaviour. I have recently undertaken some work with STEM training and note that Professor Haydn’s work is used by them in their influential teacher training projects.’* \(S4\) 

 In April 2020, Haydn distilled and coded teacher testimony from his research in a way that clearly articulated the views of experienced teachers on the most common behaviour problems teachers encounter in classrooms. The teacher testimony resource accompanying the Haydn Scale gives teachers and student teachers better understanding of complex factors influencing pupil behaviour, the effect that classroom climate has on pupil learning, and insights into why pupils behave better for some teachers than others. This enhanced the accessibility of an important part of Haydn’s research, making the data, findings and tools easily available to initial teacher education students/tutors in higher education, and students/mentors in schools, to use in conjunction with the scale itself. This increase in the reach and impact of the research has been acknowledged by DfE’s Behaviour Advisor: 

 *‘The more recent accessibility of “themed” teacher testimony from the research, on the behaviour section of Professor Haydn’s website, has also, in my opinion, enabled student teachers and NQTs to benefit from the views of experienced teachers on how to address common problems related to pupil behaviour, such as how to get the class quiet, refusal, sending pupils out, moving pupils etc.’* \(S1\) 

 Many more teachers and student teachers have accessed the scale and teacher testimony on the scale via the Teachers’ TV lecture on the research. Several Teacher Education MOOCs/VLEs have featured the use of the scale, including UCL, University of Reading, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Oxford, University of Sussex, University of Nottingham and University of York. 

 **3. Raising awareness and improving teaching and classroom management in schools:** 

 Haydn’s research has also contributed to changes in school management, school improvement and continuing professional development programmes associated with pupil behaviour. Behaviour consultant \[redacted text\] states *‘...Haydn’s research dispelled the rather cosy ideas about standards of behaviour in UK schools which prevailed a few years ago and has contributed to an acknowledgement that poor pupil behaviour is a major issue in the UK education system.’* \(S4\) 

 Setting issues of classroom climate in the context of school improvement, in 2016 Schools Minister Nick Gibb asked academy directors ‘ *What is behaviour like in your schools?*’, citing Haydn’s research and acknowledging Haydn’s findings about ‘the continued prevalence of disruption’ and their importance. Presenting Haydn’s findings relative to OFSTED’s ‘Under the Radar’ report and the Bennett Review, Gibb emphasised ‘ *understanding of the classroom culture in your schools*’ as a complement to school\-level data, and for ensuring ‘ *your academy trust allow*\[s\] *every pupil to go as far as their talents will take them.*’ \(S3\) 

 Bennett’s online Master’s level course on managing pupil behaviour makes extensive use of Haydn’s research. \[redacted text\] acknowledges that ‘... *Haydn’s research has had a significant influence in shifting perceptions of the issue of behaviour in English schools, and the scale and associated materials have had a positive influence on the quality of training available to teachers and student teachers in UK schools.’* \(S1\) 

 For school leaders and middle managers, the Haydn scale and materials have had an influence in terms of steering them towards making behaviour issues a higher priority, and in focusing on the problem of ‘in\-school variation’ in classroom climate.  At the level of individual trusts, Haydn’s research has contributed to academy improvement by providing tools to inform continuing professional development for existing teachers, for example by invitation from Sapientia Trust, whose Professional Development Lead invited Haydn’s training for *‘supporting and working alongside my teachers’* and requested *‘resources to use … across the wider Trust of four high schools and eleven primaries, and within the Teaching School.’* \(S7\) 

 **4. Influencing policy and practice and raising awareness internationally** 

 Since 2014, the Haydn Scale has been adopted in several other countries \(S9\) following translation of the scale and accompanying teacher testimonies into languages including Polish, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. The 2015 paper \(R3\) brought the scale to a wider international audience, and Haydn has subsequently been invited to talk about the research at a number of national and international conferences and seminars. The metrics for R3 in *Creative Education*, with large south east Asian readership, report 3,841 downloads and 4,927 views \(taken from scirp.org, as of December 2020\). The research is featured on teacher education MOOCs which include online interviews and simulations relating to the Haydn Scale and supporting teacher testimony resources, which have attracted subscriptions from over 140 countries \(S10\). Blog commentary from one of the FutureLearn MOOCs provides insights into why teachers find the Haydn Scale and accompanying materials useful. Participants praise the Haydn Scale’s ‘ *realistic approach*’ and linked ‘ *self\-review*’ resources for enabling teachers ‘ *to be honest*’ about classroom climate, helping them ‘ *address the factors that are influencing the learning environment*’. Teachers stated they ‘ *learnt a lot on behaviour management*’ thanks to the well explained articles \(S10\). 

 The translated Haydn Scale and materials have been accepted for publication on a major Polish education website \(S9\), and in February 2019, Haydn was invited to give a lecture and seminars on his research at the University of Tallinn, Estonia \(S9\). The Haydn Scale is widely used in schools and ITE in New Zealand; the Editor of *Principals’ Digest* described the scale as ‘one of the most widely requested and useful resources for school principals and lead teachers in New Zealand’ \(S9\). The research and supporting materials were presented and shared with 200 participants at the Innovation Teach National Conference on Behaviour in Chicago, 1st July 2014. Haydn was also invited to talk about the research at a national teacher conference in Slovenia \(S4\) and provided an online workbook on the working atmosphere of the classroom for its teacher delegates \(S9\). An adapted version of the scale for use with mathematics teachers has been used as part of the MathTASK teacher development programme in the UK and Greece \(S9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Association of Computing Machinery \(ACM\) is the oldest professional computing organisation with over 100,000 international members. Research conducted by Flick at DMU in collaboration with the ACM’s Committee on Professional Ethics informed the rewriting of the ACM’s Code of Ethics, which members of ACM are mandated to follow. The Code is considered so significant and relevant in the field that it has also been adopted by other professional organisations such as the International Federation for Information Processing \(IFIP\). 

 With professional organisation members publicly held to the Code, it has been used as a benchmark for judging emerging technologies in terms of their ethical compliance, and to publicly challenge technologies that might be ethically problematic, such as in the Google Project Dragonfly case \[C10\]. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research conducted by Catherine Flick at DMU involved large\-scale dialogues and surveys with experts in ethics, law, others interested in the ethical aspects of computing, the membership of the ACM, and the interested public all around the world, in order to understand the societal and ethical landscape of expectations of an international professional organisation in computing. 

 Using the 1992 ACM Code of Ethics as a starting point, a series of consultations with an expert taskforce \(TF\), including Flick, were conducted by the Executive Committee \(EC\) of the ACM’s Code Update Team to start the revision of the Code in 2016. The first draft was published publicly by Brinkman et al. in the *Communications of the ACM* \( *CACM*\) \(‘Making a positive impact: updating the ACM code of ethics’;  [https://doi.org/10.1145/3015149](https://doi.org/10.1145/3015149)\), and invited feedback from both members and non\-members by email \[R6\]. After this initial exercise, Flick was asked to participate as a member of the 7\-member EC as the only non\-American in order to provide a European perspective on the obligations of the Code and to conduct the significant fieldwork required for the next stage. The chair of the EC and co\-chair of the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics, writes: 

 We knew of the work of Dr Flick from her presentations on ethics of emerging technologies and responsible innovation at conferences such as ETHICOMP, published papers on informed consent in IT and ethics of emerging technologies. \[The EC\] had clear evidence of her skill and knowledge in the area, of her international background experience, so it was worth ACM’s effort to support her international travel to attend meetings in the USA to draft the Code \[and\] review and evaluate thousands of suggested modifications. \[C1\] 

 Prior research conducted by Flick was specifically used to inform the language and intent of the Code from this point onwards, particularly work on informed consent \[R1\] and ethics of emerging technologies \[R2\]. 

 Responses to the first draft were collected and analysed by the EC, including Flick, in consultation with TF experts; it was at this point she was also asked to redraft specific sections of the Code, most notably Principle 1.5, which turned into Principle 1.6 in R3 onwards. The EC held another exercise in 2017 to incorporate the feedback into a new draft, which was once again published with commentary in CACM \[R3\]. Members of the ACM as well as interested members of the public were invited to comment via a message board. And this time again, Flick was involved in collecting and analysing the data as part of the EC exercise to revise based on the feedback. A third draft was developed and published in early 2018, alongside a qualitative survey emailed to all members that had opted into email contact with the ACM \(n = \~75,000, responses = \~4,500\) \[R4\]. The task of qualitatively analysing this enormous set of data was completed by Flick, the results of which were then used by the EC to draft the final version of the Code. This final version was published openly and posted as a booklet with the July 2018 issue of CACM to \~75,000 ACM members \[R5\]. In this way, Flick’s qualitative analysis work directly contributed to the final form of the Code. 

 From the testimonial of the chair of the EC and co\-chair of the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics: 

 Dr Flick personally sorted through, organized, and analyzed \[the\] comments, including three rounds of expert, general public, and member comments, to produce summary sets of documents that were used at the next stage of the Code rewrite meetings. This analysis highlighted some of the elements that we might have otherwise missed, and particularly picked up subtle nuances that were helpful in redrafting aspects of the Code. \[…\] Another of her more significant contributions that is directly evident within the context of the Code is Principle 1.6 \[original rewrite by Flick in R3, then amended in R4 and R5\] which originally had to do with copyright, patents and intellectual property \[as can be seen in \[2.1\] as Principle 1.5\]. \[…\] She was given the task to completely rewrite and internationalize that element so that it would not talk about laws and standards that were US\-centric. \[C1\]

###  4. Details of the impact 

 100,000\+ ACM members around the world must abide by the Code, which is a condition of their membership and has a strong enforcement policy that is called on if violations are found. Consequences for breaking the Code can result in prohibition from attending ACM conferences or publishing with ACM. ACM publications and conferences are at the top in the field, and are significant publication and dissemination spaces for both academic and industry research, so this provides a significant incentive to take note of and abide by the Code. The Code has been translated into Chinese and Spanish. The acceptance and use of the final version of the Code not only by the leadership and membership of the ACM, but by other professional organisations, educators, computing professionals and others, shows the impact of Flick’s underpinning research and her direct contributions, such as in Principle 1.6, to shaping the final version of the Code \[C1\]. 

 New members have cited the ACM Code of Ethics as the reason they joined, and existing members have claimed the updated Code as a reason why they are proud of being members of the ACM, for example @andihyson on Twitter stating ‘Proud to be new member of The Association for Computing Machinery @TheOfficialACM – The code of conduct \[sic\] swung it for me’ \[C2\]. This shows the resonance of the Code for professionals who might otherwise have been reluctant to join the ACM. 

 The IFIP, which represents over 54 countries’ professional societies of computing\-related industries, is adopting the ACM Code of Ethics as their code of ethics, to exist alongside the national professional societies’ codes of ethics \[C1\]. Other professional organisations have adopted the Code for their own members’ use, showing that it has broader appeal than just the ACM \[C3\]. These institutions are, like the ACM, using the Code as a benchmark for their members’ professionalism: 

-  Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence 

-  Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals 

-  Association for Computational Linguistics 

-  Association for Software Testing 

 Conference series \(outside those of the ACM\) are also beginning to ask that papers submitted to them and conference attendees abide by the Code, for example the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing \(EMNLP\) and Supercomputing \(SC\) conference series \[C3\]. These conferences are open not just to academia, but to industry and government as well. 

 Educational institutions around the world use the ACM’s Code of Ethics as a basis to teach ethics to school\-age, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate computing students. A number of computer science programmes are using the new Code of Ethics in their curricula, with a quarter of technology ethics courses with publicly accessible curricula that teach professional ethics explicitly studying the ACM’s Code of Ethics \[C4\]. In the professional realm, the new Code has inspired people not at all involved in its development to give talks on it to their peers, or use it in continuing professional development, showing the importance to these professionals in not only internalising the new Code but disseminating it themselves to their peers, for example, its use in a DFKompetens Strategic Infosec course \[C5\], and presentations at USENIX SREcon18 \[C6\], RubyConf 2018 \[C7\]. The chair of the EC and co\-chair of the ACM Committee on Professional Ethics states that: 

 expected further impact includes in education, with the ACM’s technical curricula being updated to show the relationship between technical concepts and the principles of the ACM Code of Ethics. The ACM technical curricula include computer science, information science, and software engineering, and are promoted by the BCS \(Chartered Institute for IT\) as part of its Skills Framework for the Information Age, for university level and professional education. \[C1\] 

 On social media, the ACM Code is regularly used to question organisational practices \(Twitter search ‘ACM Code of Ethics’\) – even of the ACM itself, for example when they signed a letter in opposition to the OSTP zero embargo proposal in the US \(against open access publishing\): ‘How does @TheOfficialACM signing this statement align with the @ACM\_Ethics Code of Ethics? In particular “3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work?”’ \[C8\]. The ACM subsequently retracted their statement and submitted a more nuanced response due to ‘concerns from our members’ \[C9\]. 

 The new Code was used by Google employees to adjudicate the ethics of the Google project Dragonfly, which was cancelled after its ethics violations were brought to light \[C1, C10\], closing \(to Google\) an advertising market of 772,000,000 Chinese internet users. This shows that although the Code is aimed at an individual level, it has been used as leverage when groups of employees are ACM members and/or feel the Code represents their ethical and moral obligations \[C1\]. Other organisations such as Guna SPA \(Italy\) have used the Code to inform their practices and KPIs, or have adopted the Code internally with assistance from the Committee chair \[C1\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Stirling and Johnstone’s work has uncovered the role that UK civilian nuclear power plays in subsidising UK military submarine capabilities. This has: 

1.  Enhanced citizen and consumer awareness and lead to public scrutiny of UK energy policy 

1.  Stimulated policy debate and helped open up democratic discussion towards more transparent policymaking in the UK, enabling more robust discussion around the full cost implications of UK civil and military nuclear infrastructures taken as a whole. 

 The research reveals large\-scale economic dependencies of the UK military submarine industry by adding hidden consumer funding to taxpayer support for civil nuclear new builds \(like Hinkley Point C\), so exposing how civilian nuclear power subsidises military nuclear R&D and skills bases. This link is helping to lock the UK into expensive nuclear power, for which consumers bear the cost hidden in elevated energy bills. With implications of several billions of pounds in terms of the potential subsidy from consumer energy bills to defence nuclear activities, beneficiaries include the UK public, electricity consumers and policy actors working in their interests. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 As part of the ESRC\-funded Discontinuity in Technological Systems \(DiscGo\) project from 2013 until 2016, Andy Stirling and Phil Johnstone have undertaken research on the policy evolution of UK nuclear power. They have identified the hitherto entirely neglected role that pressures to sustain nuclear submarine capabilities play in driving the UK’s ‘nuclear renaissance’. The research has clearly indicated the role played in driving the UK’s nuclear power revival by the publicly\-acknowledged military priority of maintaining the national skills base for building and operating nuclear submarines. They found compelling and previously unacknowledged links in military documentation from 2003\-2017 that civilian nuclear capabilities have played a key role in sustaining military\-related nuclear capabilities, particularly around submarines. See referenced publications below. 

 \[ **R1**\] developed and applied a novel set of criteria to compare UK and German nuclear policy, which found that the UK’s enthusiasm for new nuclear was difficult to understand based on conventional theories of change in innovation systems and energy transitions. The article outlines that the presence in the UK \(but not in Germany\) of military nuclear activity \(including nuclear submarines\) is an important, yet almost entirely unexamined, reason for the UK’s attachment to civil nuclear. It calls for greater attention to this issue. 

 \[ **R2**\] then examines a variety of theories on incumbency and develops a novel analytical approach for researching ‘deep incumbency’ based on a ‘configuring fields’ approach. Deep incumbency is a term developed by the authors that is attentive to deeper and more distributed power dynamics than are normally addressed in this kind of research – extending not only across the individual sectors on which research usually focuses, but also pervading entire polities. Interdependencies documented in this research between military submarine and civil nuclear power industries exemplify a deep incumbency that evidently implicates several nations. In order to enable research to better address this hitherto neglected form of incumbency, the paper defines contrasting ‘open’ and ‘closed’ topologies of incumbency – as respectively seen under an ‘eagle\-eye’ and a ‘worm\-eye view’. It is the latter lens that forms the conceptual background to researching the dynamics of military\-related nuclear activities impinging on civil nuclear power trajectories. 

 \[ **R3**\] builds on the theme of deep incumbency by highlighting – through a detailed documentary analysis of UK military\-related and civil nuclear policy documentation – how the UK’s energy trajectory is locked\-in to new nuclear due to pressures to maintain nuclear submarine capabilities, which have been entirely neglected by the energy policy community. 

 \[ **R4**\] tests the ‘deep incumbency hypothesis’ on nuclear submarines being a driver of UK civil nuclear commitments by conducting an extensive documentary analysis of policy documentation related to both civil and military nuclear power in the UK and using a coding process to organise key statements on both civil and military nuclear power. This involves the publishing of extensive further evidence on how the priority of maintaining UK nuclear submarine capabilities is influencing the intensity of UK civil nuclear ambitions. 

 In \[ **R5**\] new substantive evidence that emerged in 2017 was examined including documents, reports and statements by politicians and industry in different countries that highlight military\-related nuclear activity as influencing civil nuclear new build. This performed a pattern\-matching analysis exploring the relationship between the intensity of different countries’ civil nuclear new build ambitions and their nuclear weapons and military status. A clear correlation was found in which countries with ambitious nuclear new build agendas tend either to be existing or aspiring nuclear weapons states. 

 These papers provide rigorous empirical analysis and conceptual contributions. Overall, the papers have presented significant evidence of interdependencies between civil and military nuclear activities both in relation to global patterns of nuclear new build and the detailed case of the UK. A crucial finding is that the sustaining of the industrial base for military\-related nuclear activities – in particular for nuclear submarine construction, maintenance and operation – is a key \(albeit hitherto undocumented\) factor influencing nuclear new build with significant economic and democratic implications.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 For several decades, the nuclear industry has repeatedly strongly denied any significant link between civil and military nuclear capacities. Uniquely initiated by Stirling and Johnstone’s research \[ **R1\-5**\] – which uncovered the role that civilian nuclear power plays in subsidising submarine\-related military nuclear research and development needs and skills bases – new policy and public media debates have been incited and informed by the research evidence. 

 **Enhanced consumer awareness and public scrutiny of UK energy policy** 

 Before 2016, there was no acknowledgement at all of the submarine\-specific link between civil and military nuclear capabilities and other connections were more generally denied. Since publishing research output \[ **R1**\] the researchers have engaged in media work, given written and oral evidence to parliamentary committees, and held speaker engagements and meetings to raise awareness of the issue. Initially, there was great difficulty getting the research reported in UK mainstream media outlets, but it was covered by the *New York Times* on 10 October 2016 \(‘Britain’s nuclear cover up’\) and in the German daily *De Tageszeitung* \(‘Hidden Money für Atom\-U\-Boote’\) on 23 November 2016 \[ **S1a&b**\]. The coverage first brought this entirely neglected issue into the public domain, with the research gaining international media attention and increasing UK consumer and energy policy awareness. 

 Evidence submitted to the Public Accounts Committee’s Hinkley C inquiry \(October 2017\) led to the first UK mainstream media coverage of the nuclear subsidy issue, published in a leading British newspaper, *The Guardian*: ‘Consumers to fund nuclear weapons through Hinkley C’, 12 October 2017 followed by ‘The “dreadful deal” behind the world’s most expensive power plant’, 21 December 2017 \[ **S1c&d**\]. Based on the research, these articles raised awareness amongst British consumers that higher energy bills due to new nuclear rest in part on military reasons. Subsequent media articles have been published. After presenting the research at the Oxford Energy Colloquia, the authors were approached by BBC journalist Roger Harrabin, who wrote a BBC news article: ‘Nuclear: Energy bills “used to subsidise submarines”’, 5 June 2019 \[ **S1e**\]. This led to articles being published on the research in *The Independent* \(‘Homeowners forced to pay higher energy bills to subsidize nuclear submarines’, 5 June 2019\), *The Scotsman* \( *‘*Energy bills subsidising Scotland’s submarines’, 6 June 2019\) \[ **S1f&g**\] and later \(significantly\) a detailed sympathetic feature in *The Daily Telegraph* \(‘Britain's push for nuclear power makes no sense, unless it is a hidden subsidy for the Royal Navy’ online, and ‘With the UK case for nuclear power lost, the battle now is one of defence’ in print, 16\-17 December 2020\) \[ **S1h**\]. This media coverage, directly informed by the research, has enhanced consumer awareness of what energy bills are paying for over several years, challenging established norms. 

 **Stimulated policy debate and opened up democratic discussion towards more transparent policymaking** 

 The researchers’ written and oral evidence to the Public Accounts Committee’s \(PAC\) Hinkley C inquiry in October 2017 highlighted the entirely neglected role that sustaining capabilities for the nuclear submarine programme plays in the UK Government’s intense support for a civil nuclear programme, and thus helped to highlight this issue to parliamentarians. 

 The Committee’s Chair, Meg Hillier MP, was influenced by the researchers’ evidence, which she drew on and cited in a subsequent  [oral evidence session](http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/public-accounts-committee/hinkley-point-c/oral/71001.pdf) \(9 October 2017\) in order to question \(Q84\) Mr Stephen Lovegrove CB \(Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Defence\) on the advantages of a civil nuclear programme for the submarine programme \[ **S2a**\]. This led \(for the first time on the public record\) to a UK Government official confirming that there are linkages between civil nuclear new build and the submarine programme, and that the civil nuclear new build programme was beneficial with regard to submarine capabilities \[ **S2a**\]. With implications possibly extending to many tens of billions of pounds, this first public acknowledgement of the research findings \[ **R1\-5**\] is very important in terms of transparent policymaking. 

 This large\-scale cost issue – relating to the cross\-subsidy of military capabilities by civil nuclear consumer revenues, as well as related assessment and planning issues – was picked up in the PAC’s report on Hinkley C \[ **S2a**\], in which the Committee recommended that: 

1.  The Department \(BEIS\) should tell the Committee how it will ensure there is an independent and transparent assessment of the impacts on consumers, including the impacts on the poorest households, when agreeing future energy infrastructure deals that are paid for through consumers’ bills. 

1.  The Department should re\-evaluate and publish its strategic case for supporting nuclear power before agreeing any further deals for nuclear power stations. 

 The Government agreed with these recommendations \[ **S2b**\]. 

 In the year following publication of the research, there have been a number of high\-profile reports that have confirmed exactly the same linkages so distinctively highlighted in this research. This includes a high\-level report by Ernest Moniz, former United States Secretary of Energy, released on 12 July 2017 \[ **S3a**\], and acknowledgements in the UK of civil\-military linkages by Rolls Royce in their document on Small Modular Reactors published on 12 September 2017 \[ **S3b**\]. 

 Since the inquiry, parts of Government have been increasingly open about civil\-military nuclear linkages. They have not cited this research, but under the circumstances this would not be expected, since it involves implicit acknowledgement of past concealment of these linkages. Yet, in the UK Government’s ‘Nuclear Sector Deal’ document \(7 December 2017\) \[ **S4**\] there is frequent reference to the *‘synergies’* between the two programmes and how the Government aims to ensure the transferability of nuclear workers between them. In another example, Richard Harrington, under\-Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), stated on 11 July 2018 that he wants to “include the MoD in everything we do” on nuclear and that the “artificial distinction” between civil and defence nuclear should come to an end \[ **S5**\]. Such stark statements by Government Ministers have only occurred since this research has been published and publicised in the media. 

 Most recently, the research, submitted as evidence to the BEIS inquiry into the financing of energy infrastructure and published by BEIS on 5 June 2019 \[ **S6**\] has influenced parliamentarians to request an inquiry into the link between Civil and Military Nuclear Use, citing research as the basis for calling for an inquiry into this issue \[ **S7**\]. 

 A motion was lodged in the Scottish Parliament on civil\-military nuclear linkages \(6 June 2019\) explicitly stating that “…the Parliament notes analysis by the University of Sussex, which suggests that energy bills are inflated to partly subside the UK’s nuclear weapons arsenal” and that this provides “a compelling explanation for the UK’s resolute commitment to nuclear energy projects” \[ **S8**\]. 

 The research has thus changed UK policymaking practice, influencing political moves to influence Government towards greater transparency regarding subsidies for nuclear submarines through energy bills. In short, through this work, the issue has moved from being entirely neglected within UK democratic institutions in 2016 to being a live policy issue under increasing scrutiny by 2019.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Southampton’s WorldPop research programme was established in October 2013. Research within the programme led by **Tatem**, **Sorichetta** and **Utazi** \(supported by other WorldPop staff\) into the improvement of spatial demographic evidence has led to a series of innovations in the construction of consistent and high resolution population maps through integrating census, survey and satellite\-based data. The outputs have formed the basis for estimation of populations at risk of disease, and for planning purposes by governments, UN agencies and others around the world. This includes production of new national statistics used by the government, UN and World Bank in Afghanistan, population maps that have formed the basis of polio elimination in Nigeria, the spatial demographic basis for the World Health Organization’s \(WHO\) malaria burden estimates in Africa, as well as multiple government health information systems and COVID\-19 response efforts around the world. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The global human population is growing by more than 80 million a year, with the vast majority of this growth concentrated in low and middle income countries. Detailed spatial data on population distributions and characteristics are a prerequisite for the accurate measurement of impacts of growth, for planning interventions and monitoring progress towards development goals. While high income countries have extensive mapping resources and expertise at their disposal to create such data, these are either lacking or of poor quality across low income regions, forming a major obstacle to planning of services and intervention targeting. 

 Southampton’s WorldPop research group, led by Tatem, have been developing methods for improving the spatial demographic evidence base in low and middle income countries since October 2013. The underlying research involves development of spatial statistical algorithms for the integration of more 'traditional' sources of demographic data, such as censuses and household surveys, with newer digital datasets derived from GPS, digital boundaries, satellite imagery and elsewhere. WorldPop’s algorithms produce estimates of population counts, demographics and characteristics per 100x100m or 1x1km grid squares across countries, together with associated metadata and measures of uncertainty. The benefits of such methods and outputs include: \(i\) a set of flexible open tools that can be adapted to different environments and levels of data availability; \(ii\) sufficient spatial detail to support targeting of interventions for meeting the Sustainable Development Goals; and \(iii\) a flexible format to facilitate summarization at different spatial scales and integration with diverse data sets \(e.g. locations of health facilities to estimate catchment population sizes\). 

 Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Tatem’s WorldPop team developed and applied random forests\-based machine learning approaches for disaggregating census counts or estimates at administrative unit levels \(e.g. for enumeration area or ward boundaries\) to high resolution 100x100m gridded population counts structured by age and sex classes \[e.g. **3.1**\]. These approaches have been scaled to global extents, producing outputs for the 2000\-2020 period in collaboration with Columbia University. Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust and the United Nations Population Fund \(UNFPA\), methods have been adapted to map births and pregnancies across low and middle income countries \[ **3.2**\]. 

 Where **census\-based population counts are outdated or inaccurate**, WorldPop have developed Bayesian geostatistical methods for the production of gridded population count and age/sex structures through the integration of small area microcensus surveys with geospatial covariate data, in collaboration with various low and middle income country governments \[ **3.3, 3.4**\]. This work has been funded through awards from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \(FCDO\) \(formerly UK Department for International Development \(DfID\)\) and UNFPA. Additional funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Data2X \(a programme promoting data on gender\) led to the adaptation of these geostatistical approaches to the high resolution mapping of population characteristics and intervention coverages \(e.g. poverty, vaccination coverage, literacy\) from GPS\-located household survey data and collaboration with governments \[ **3.5, 3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The development and implementation of methods for population mapping **in the absence of adequate census data** has resulted in a range of impacts: 

 *\-Service delivery and public health planning in Afghanistan:* Collaboration with UNFPA and the government of Afghanistan in 2015\-17 produced new spatially detailed population estimates. These were presented by Tatem in Kabul to President Ghani, his cabinet, heads of UN agencies and multiple diplomats and ambassadors in late 2017. WorldPop’s estimates have since been adopted by the UN and many other international organizations in the country and are undergoing cabinet approval to become the new official government population statistics, replacing projections from the last census in 1979 \[ **5.1**\]. The estimates have since been used continuously in planning and implementing polio vaccination in the country by the government and the WHO’s polio eradication initiative, as well as by the government and World Bank in designing new household surveys \[ **5.1**\]. In both cases the modelled estimates have replaced 1979 projections to produce more reliable, precise and efficient approaches. 

 \- *Public health and education planning by Nigeria’s government*: Similar population modelling in Nigeria has been used to plan polio elimination efforts since 2014, after the 2006 census data proved to be too inaccurate. The switch to the modelled estimates for assessment of needs, planning vaccination strategies and operational implementation contributed to successful delivery of vaccination and the elimination of polio in the country in 2015. Evidence from post\-campaign coverage surveys showed that where the modelled estimates were used to plan vaccination in northern Nigeria, no areas were found to have unvaccinated children, compared to the south where children in at least ten of the sampled settlements were found to have been missed \[ **5.2**\]. As the Nigerian National Primary Health Care Development Agency notes \[ **5.2**\] *“Outbreaks fell to zero and have stayed there. These innovations did more than help eradicate polio in northern Nigeria”*. The data are currently used in the national vaccination tracking system \[ **5.3**\], have fed into the National Surgical, Obstetrics, Anaesthesia & Nursing Plan \(NSOANP\) for Nigeria, and are used by the Ministry of Education \(UBEC\) to assess school coverage \[ **5.4**\]. 

 *\-Uptake by UNFPA and for service delivery in Colombia:* The Afghanistan and Nigeria work resulted in WorldPop’s modelling approaches being adopted in the UNFPA census strategy in July 2019 \[ **5.5**\], and the establishment of a new $40M programme, GRID3, where the WorldPop group are funded to support governments in sub\-Saharan Africa with modelling and capacity strengthening. As of December 2020, this involves active support to 10 governments, covering 55% of the population of sub\-Saharan Africa \[ **5.6**\]. Moreover, through partnerships established with UNFPA, additional modelling efforts continue in collaboration with national governments. This includes the government of Colombia, where the national statistics office, DANE, was unable to complete full enumeration in their 2018 census \[ **5.1**\], depriving many regions of the accurate data required for effective governance and resource allocation. The WorldPop group worked with DANE to develop modelling methods to impute population estimates for unenumerated areas. These were released as national statistics in 2019 \[ **5.7**\] **.** In Colombia and elsewhere, the data saw “ *widespread usage within governments for …health system planning, school placement and census planning”* \[ **5.1**; Dr. Juran, UNFPA\]. 

 Following production of the high resolution gridded population datasets produced through **disaggregation of administrative unit\-based census or official estimates**, these were made open access through the WorldPop website, and a range of collaborations and uses followed: 

 \- *Disaster relief by UNITAR, FAO and via UN humanitarian data hub:* From November 2013 to present, WorldPop’s maps have consistently formed the standard dataset for the Operational Satellite Applications Programme \(UNOSAT\) of the UN Institute for Training and Research \(UNITAR\) for assessment of populations impacted by disasters and other events \(e.g. the 13.5 million people affected by Cyclone IRMA\-17 \[ **5.8**\]\), where no other detailed population data exist. They provide the numbers used by response and aid agencies to assess needs and scope budgets. The data also form the core population input to the FAO’s geospatial platform \[ **5.8**\], used to plan food security and agricultural operations. From 2017, collaboration with the UN's Humanitarian Data Exchange enabled population total estimates to be produced globally for UN\-recognised boundaries. In 2020, the datasets were downloaded 11,883 times by 4,779 individual users to support humanitarian operations such as aid and healthcare delivery, with 155,000 further downloads via the WorldPop web site \[ **5.9**\]. 

 *\-Training via UNFPA:* In April 2016, the population mapping work was presented by Tatem to heads and representatives of all national statistical offices of the world as the keynote talk at the UN’s Commission on Population and Development \[ **5.10**\]. WorldPop delivered training on data use at UNFPA headquarters in New York, via multiple UN regional workshops for heads of statistical offices, and multiple country capacity strengthening sessions, with cohorts of university staff within GRID3 focus countries trained to deliver future training to governments. This has included co\-leading with UNFPA sessions on population modelling for over 50 representatives from the UN and governments in the Arab States region in 2018 and a similar number for the West and Central Africa region in 2019. In 2020, more than 500 government, local university and UN staff attended training run through GRID3.  Dr. Juran of UNFPA notes *‘the collaborations with WorldPop have helped UNFPA build important new areas to fulfil one of its key missions in supporting population and housing censuses in all low\- and middle\-income countries’* \[ **5.1**\]. 

 \- *International health metrics:* The datasets are widely used in the health metrics field, forming the denominator used for many African countries in the World Malaria Reports by WHO in 2016\-2019 \[ **5.11**\], the ongoing Local Burden of Disease work \[ **5.12**\] and from 2014, UNFPA's State of the World's Midwifery series \[ **5.13**\]. Such metrics are used to set international funding allocations, strategic priorities and for global advocacy, and reliable and consistent denominators at subnational scales are vital for their production. 

 *\-Pandemic response:* WorldPop datasets have been widely used in COVID\-19 pandemic response. This has included use as the demographic basis for the highly publicised Imperial College and IHME COVID transmission models \[ **5.14**\], which led to the implementation of lockdown measures by the UK and US governments in March 2020. Moreover the datasets form the demographic basis of UNFPA’s COVID\-19 Vulnerability platform and UN\-OCHA’s COVID\-19 Map Explorer \[ **5.15**\]. Via Grid3, WorldPop datasets have been used by at least three African governments in their response efforts \[ **5.16**\]. 

 The research’s impact was recognised in 2020 through the Royal Geographical Society’s Back Award to Prof Tatem “ *for leading the development* *of geospatial and demographic data to assist the work of public policy around the globe*”. One award is made annually for geographical studies making an outstanding contribution to national or international public policy \[ **5.17**\].

 **Impact**: Dr Joeri Rogelj set out new societal transformation pathways for limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre\-industrial levels and developed the world’s first comprehensive framework for estimating and tracking the remaining global carbon budget. His work underpins landmark science\-policy assessments, informing and driving ambitious new climate policies at the international and national levels, while broadening societal awareness of the importance of urgent climate change mitigation. 

 **Beneficiaries**: International and national policymakers, human and natural systems threatened by climate change. 

 **Significance and Reach**: Rogelj’s findings, which have already resulted in new climate legislation in the UK, France and elsewhere, have reached a worldwide audience and will support implementation of the Paris Agreement, benefiting billions of people across the planet. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research led by Dr Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College London has addressed key knowledge gaps at the climate science\-policy interface. Climate change mitigation research over the past decade has looked at strategies for limiting global warming to levels considered safe by society, a question often explored with models that integrate knowledge across the engineering, economic, agricultural and physical sciences. 

 Rogelj pioneered the exploration of detailed societal transformation pathways towards limiting warming to 1.5°C. This work provided the only study of its kind in time to inform the negotiations on the 2015 Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\). He led an international consortium of six integrated assessment modelling teams to show how society’s ability to limit warming to 1.5°C critically depends on specific socioeconomic drivers \(in the literature described as “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways”\). This climate change research has continued with several publications that contribute important, novel perspectives on how the Paris Agreement can be implemented. 

 Rogelj’s Imperial work, published in 2018, showed how increased energy services can be provided to poor and vulnerable populations while reducing overall global energy demand and achieving sustainable development goals through a transformation to a highly efficient society **\[1\]**. An additional influential 2019 study highlighted the inherent biases of dominant approaches used to design climate change scenarios. Rogelj’s work identified those strategies that result in high climate risk and engrained intergenerational unfairness. He then presented solutions by focussing on net\-zero targets instead **\[2\]**. 

 More recent work by Rogelj and colleagues on societal transformation scenarios culminated in the design, development, and open\-source publication of a vetted climate scenario database **\[3\]**. This now serves as a key community resource, enabling re\-use and further investigation of societal transformation pathways by academics and government analysts. This research provides, inter alia, the evidence underpinning key characteristics of 1.5°C\-consistent pathways, including the need to reach net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by mid\-century. 

 This research on societal transformations for ambitious climate goals is complemented by research on methods to analyse the implications of the current gap between countries’ pledges and pathways that limit global warming to the levels agreed upon in the UN Paris Agreement **\[4\]**. For example, Rogelj’s research highlighted the woeful inadequacy of progress towards climate protection over the past 10 years and demonstrated that more ambitious climate pledges, combined with early and aggressive action, are now imperative to ensure a safe future climate. 

 Finally, Rogelj and colleagues established a comprehensive framework for estimating and tracking the remaining carbon budget, that is, the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can ever be emitted while keeping global warming below specific temperature limits **\[5\]**. This framework resolved key misunderstandings and provided clarity to policy makers about how some of their policy choices influence the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can still be emitted while keeping warming to levels consistent with the UN Paris Agreement.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Global warming, driven by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, poses severe risks for natural and human systems. Average global temperatures have already risen to approximately 1.0°C above pre\-industrial levels as a result of human activities **\[A\]** and a science\-policy consensus has emerged, enshrined in the Paris Agreement, which seeks to limit warming to well below 2.0°C, and ideally to 1.5°C. 

 Before Rogelj’s research, policy\-makers faced two significant obstacles: 

-  It was unclear whether and how the 1.5°C limit might be achieved. While numerous groups publish scenarios, none offered a clear way forward to keep warming below the 1.5°C limit. Moreover, the scenarios were risky, permitting the 1.5°C limit to be exceeded \(as long as temperatures returned to 1.5°C by 2100\) and unfair, placing the greatest burdens on later generations. 

-  There was also disagreement and misunderstanding about the size of the world’s remaining carbon budget, the total amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that can still be emitted while keeping global warming below the 1.5°C limit. A robust and up\-to\-date carbon budget estimate was critical to informing climate policies, and tracking performance, but a wide range of conflicting estimates hindered progress. 

 Rogelj successfully addressed both challenges, by detailing new societal transformation pathways that could limit warming to 1.5°C without exceeding the target or requiring intergenerational unfairness **\[1, 2, 3\]**, and by establishing a comprehensive, transparent framework for estimating and tracking the carbon budget **\[5\]**. He also developed methods **\[4\]** to assess the gap between the global warming outcomes likely to result from national climate pledges and the temperature limits established in the Paris Agreement. 

 As a result, Rogelj’s ground\-breaking work has: 

1.  **Transformed science\-policy assessments at the international level** 

1.  **Driven ambitious policy decisions at the national level** 

1.  **Broadened wider societal awareness and engagement in climate change** 

 **International impacts** 

 Rogelj’s research provided a critical evidence base for the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C \(SR1.5\), a landmark report published in October 2018 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \(IPCC\) **\[A\]**. More than 15 of Rogelj’s papers were referenced in the SR1.5. Importantly, all four of the central illustrative pathways used by the report to communicate strategic mitigation choices to policymakers are from studies led or co\-authored by Rogelj. Indeed, Chapter 2 of the SR1.5 directly referenced Rogelj’s work **\[1\]** when describing these pathways \(page 110\), as well as applying Rogelj’s framework for estimating remaining carbon budget **\[5\]** for the first time \(pages 104\-8\). The SR1.5 concludes, again directly based on Rogelj’s research, **\[3\]** that pathways consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C halve global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 and reach net zero CO<sub>2</sub> around mid\-century – insights that have had a fundamental impact on national policy. 

 Rogelj’s research **\[1, 3, 4\]** also directly underpins the Emissions Gap Report \(EGR\) **\[B\]**, published annually by the UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\). The EGR estimates how much warming could be expected should countries’ pledges on greenhouse gas emissions\-cutting be implemented, and how temperatures would diverge from the limits set out in the Paris Agreement. The Head of Thematic Scientific Assessments at UNEP, confirms that *“the novel methods Joeri Rogelj published to assess the gap between countries’ climate pledges and their global warming outcome have become the \[EGR’s\] scientific and analytical backbone.”* **\[C\]**. The EGR and \- by extension, Rogelj’s work \- is of critical importance in international climate policy circles. Referencing the opening session of Conference of the Parties \(COP 25\), the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference held in Madrid, they note that **“** *3 out of 5 speakers … made direct use of EGR messages in their speech. The same was the case for the UN Secretary General in his separate address…”* **\[C\]**. The EGR findings were referred to in Decisions 1/CMA.2 and 1/CP.25 of COP25, adopted by all 197 countries of the UNFCCC. 

 **National impacts** 

 Rogelj’s research, and the authoritative science\-policy assessments it informs, has also directly influenced significant national policy change. The publication of the IPCC SR1.5 **\[A\]** prompted the UK, Scottish and Welsh Governments to ask the UK Committee on Climate Change \(CCC\) to assess its implications for the UK’s long\-term climate target and net zero greenhouse gas date **\[D\]**. The resulting Net Zero Report **\[E\]**, published by CCC in May 2019, cites Rogelj’s research database **\[3\]** as evidencing four of the six diagrams in Chapter 2, and for all quantitative tables in both Chapter 2 and 3. Insights from Rogelj’s research activities for the UNEP EGR **\[B\]** are also cited in the Net Zero Report’s context setting and analysis. The UK CCC corroborates Rogelj’s contribution: *“Research outputs of Dr Rogelj played a critical role in shaping the evidence base for the SR1.5 and subsequently informing the CCC advice to Government* **” \[F\]**. The CCC Net Zero Report directly led to the UK’s adoption in June 2019 of an ambitious net zero greenhouse gas emissions target as a legally binding national long\-term climate goal.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Alistair Hunt of the University of Bath has developed methods for calculating the economic costs of air pollution, allowing him to quantify for the first time the negative costs of vehicle emissions, particularly from diesel vehicles, on health in the UK. This led to the establishment of the Clean Van Commitment, with 30 signatories to date, including Tesco and Engie, who have committed to replace their total UK fleet of over 18,000 vans with zero\-emissions vans by 2028 and to replace over 2,000 vans by the end of 2020. Hunt’s research was also cited as evidence supporting the announcement of an extension of London’s Ultra\-Low Emission Zone to cover an area bounded by the north and south circular roads, which will mean 100,000 people no longer live in areas exceeding legal air quality. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Hunt has an ongoing research programme at University of Bath that quantifies the risks of climate change and air pollution at the local, national and European level, and the costs and benefits of adapting to these risks. His research has examined the real\-world practicalities of translating academic research on environmental damage to policy changes. In a transdisciplinary case study, he and colleagues linked the environmental quality of an urban habitat to health and the associated economic costs and explored where and how health features in decision\-making \( **Ref 1**\). 

  

 Hunt’s research addresses the limitations of existing willingness\-to\-pay calculations in the context of air pollution and adapts these to make them more appropriate. With colleagues, Hunt has developed and applied a way of valuing people’s preferences in relation to the risk of premature mortality. This elicits people’s values for avoiding reductions in the length of lifetime and thereby derives the value of a life\-year \(VOLY\). In a 2011 article, this method was used to derive a VOLY for the EU for the first time \( **Ref 2**\). As part of this, a survey was conducted in six European countries. Hunt’s contributions to the survey design focused on the effectiveness of the means of communicating the change in risk and length of lifetime to the survey respondent and the role of context in determining the elicited values. Adapting the approach taken in this publication, Hunt was also able to quantify the costs to human health of climate change from heat and flooding. His results and methodology were presented in a 2011 publication \( **Ref 3**\). 

  

 In 2018, Hunt and Christian Brand \(University of Oxford\) were commissioned by the charity Global Action Plan to conduct research into the health costs associated with pollution from conventionally\-fuelled cars \( **Ref 4**\). This built on their work on air pollution and used the VOLY measures developed by Hunt in his 2011 article \( **Ref 2**\). Hunt was primarily responsible for the economic valuation of the health impacts. The key insights from this research showed that the health damage associated with diesel vehicle emissions is around 20 times greater than that associated with electric vehicles and at least five times greater than that associated with petrol vehicles. Annual exposure to the air pollutants PM<sub>2.5</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> is linked to an estimated 40,000 early deaths in the UK each year. Health costs are significantly higher for diesel cars and vans compared to petrol, hybrid or electric vehicles over their 14 and 9\-year lifetimes. Key findings relating to inner city areas such as central London include: 

-  The average cost to the NHS and society of a car is GBP7,714; 

-  The health damage cost from each diesel car is GBP16,424 and each van is GBP24,555; 

-  Health damage from older diesel vans costs GBP2,200,000,000,000 per annum to the NHS and society. 

 The report also highlighted that nearly 90% of the total GBP6,000,000,000,000 bill to the NHS and wider society caused by emissions is attributable to diesel emissions. This study illustrated for the first time the individual cost that each car and van has on the NHS and wider society.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Hunt and Brand’s research \( **Ref 4**\), using the VOLY measures developed by Hunt \( **Ref 2**\), demonstrated the significant health costs of diesel\-fuelled cars and vans. These insights were used in 2018 to inform Global Action Plan’s annual Clean Air Day and were launched via press release on 6 June 2018 \[ **Source** **a**\]. The research was disseminated in over 300 online and print news reports \- local \(more than 168 reports\), national \(including the *Times, Guardian, Daily Express, Daily Mail* and *Sun*\) and international \(Italian, Egyptian, Dutch, Polish and Chinese\-language\). More than 40 national radio broadcasts reported on the findings, with Hunt undertaking 4 interviews with national and local radio stations \(Heart FM, Radio 5 Live, Radio Bristol, Swindon FM\). 

 Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, announced on 8 June 2018 that the Ultra\-Low Emission Zone, originally announced in 2017 and implemented in central London from 8 April 2019, would be extended across a wider area of London from 25 October 2021. The initial zone coincided with the Congestion Charge area, while the extension encompasses an area bounded by the north and south circular roads. The accompanying press release referred exclusively to Hunt’s co\-authored report \( **Ref 4**\) \[ **Source** **b**\]. Most vehicles, including the cars and vans Hunt found to be so damaging to air quality, will need to meet new, tighter exhaust emission standards or their drivers will be liable for a daily charge to drive within the covered area. These measures mean that 100,000 people will no longer live in areas exceeding legal air quality \[ **Source** **b**\]. 

 Hunt’s research \( **Ref 4**\) also led to Global Action Plan, in partnership with utility company Engie and with the backing of the Department for Transport, launching the Clean Van Commitment \(CVC\) in September 2018. This encourages organisations to pledge to replace diesel vans with clean electric alternatives, with clear commitments to be met by the end of 2020 and by 2028.  A statement of intent by Engie and Global Action Plan cited Hunt’s work, stating that “ *research by academics at the Universities of Oxford and Bath has revealed that the overall health damage from cars and vans costs the NHS and society £6 trillion per year*” \[ **Source** **c,** p.9\]. 

 16 of the UK’s largest van fleet operators, collectively operating 18,169 vans, signed the CVC upon its launch, including Tesco, Anglian Water and Network Rail \[ **Source** **c**\]. The group committed to finding zero\-emissions replacements for 2,389 vans by the end of 2020 and to replace their entire fleets with zero\-emissions vans by 2028 \[ **Source** **d**\]. The CVC allows van fleet operators collectively to show the level of market demand and, in turn, accelerate the transition to electrifying the UK’s 4,000,000 diesel vans \[ **Source** **e**\]. CEO of Engie UK and Ireland, highlighted how “ *It is only by continuing to raise awareness of the importance of solving the air quality crisis and from collective action by all stakeholders in society that we can make change happen*” \[ **Source** **c,** p.2\], while Climate Change Manager at Tesco, stated that “ *We support the CVC and view such initiatives as an integral part of climate change agenda*” \[ **Source** **c**, p.8\]. 

 There are now over 30 signatories to the CVC, across sectors including utilities, retail, the NHS and local government \[ **Source** **f**\]. Fleet manager of Gateshead Council described how “ *Gateshead Council’s Fleet department continues to review operations with the aim to make Council driving both safer and greener. Practices and procedures aim to reduce fleet mileage, fuel consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Becoming one of the first Clean Van Commitment signatories is an important part of this*” \[ **Source** **c,** p.5\]. 75,000,000,000,000 miles are driven each year in vans and vans are the fastest growing vehicle type in the country. They contribute 30% of the UK’s road transport NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, costing 3 times more per vehicle to the UK’s health than cars. The commitment is therefore of great significance in reducing emissions \[ **Sources** **d, e, g**\]. As the Senior Partner at Global Action Plan, puts it “ *The Clean Van Commitment \(CVC\) provides momentum and much needed clarity for the fledgling electric van industry*” \[ **Source** **h**\]. 

 A comment by the UK Roads Minister, refers directly to Hunt’s co\-authored report and stresses the importance of the CVC: “ *This latest research further highlights the very serious potential impacts of nitrous oxide pollution, and underlines the importance of the transition to greener transport. That is why the Clean Van Commitment is important, encouraging some of the biggest van fleet operators in the UK to switch to cleaner vehicles*” \[ **Source** **d**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Kevin Yuill’s research on assisted suicide has set the current debates on the issue into historical context, challenging assumptions and providing new perspectives. His ideas and findings have directly shaped national policy in the Netherlands and New Zealand, and influenced policymakers in Denmark and the USA.  His numerous appearances to discuss his work in mainstream and specialist media and at live debates and cultural festivals worldwide have informed public debate and shaped individual attitudes. The research has been cited by influential campaigners on both sides of the argument. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Yuill’s research examines the changing relationship between the individual and the state. It situates the present discussion about assisted dying, euthanasia and end\-of\-life concerns historically, showing that, rather than a constant ethical discussion dating back many centuries, the present ‘right\-to\-die’ debate emerged around 1970 and is historically distinct from previous discussions of euthanasia \( **R1**\). Furthermore, the idea that suicides required assistance did not exist before the twentieth century \( **R2**\). In the 1970s, alongside a growing critique of medical paternalism, the voluntary euthanasia movement, as it was then called, switched focus from the need for population control and eugenic culling of ‘inferior’ individuals to autonomy for dying individuals. In this change of focus, citizens were less independent actors who determined their own fates, and were instead characterised as helpless dependents relying on the American government to accomplish tasks that they had always done for themselves. Dying became something that was done to an individual rather than, as it had been, something that happens. It became a responsibility of the state. 

 Yuill’s project indicates the historical specificity of these developments but also challenges some of the assumptions that underlie the debate today. In Chapter 3 of **R1**, on the origins of the right to die movement, Yuill indicates how the discussion emerged not because of advances in technology but because of a shift in the relationship between citizen and government, an idea he explores in other works. He indicates the historical specificity of the promotion of ‘the right to die’. In **R2** he shows that, when a cultural toleration of suicide on the basis of self\-government appeared in the 1890s’ United States, there was no separate discussion of the need to ‘assist’ suicide; moreover, euthanasia and suicide were separate discussions.

 Policymakers worldwide have engaged with Yuill’s research, either through invited testimony or as a result of reading his work. He himself has been proactive in stimulating public debate and discussion, bringing the topic out of government inquiry and into the public realm. Despite taking a very specific position on the issue, Yuill’s research has informed both sides of the debate. 

 <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>national</ins> <ins>government</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>and organisation</ins><ins>s</ins> 

 **The Netherlands:** In 2013 the Dutch government commissioned an investigation into the possibility of providing euthanasia to those over the age of 70 who were ‘tired of life’. A member of the Schnabel Committee tasked with this investigation used Yuill’s research \( **R1**\) in forming his response to the question of the moral responsibility of the government **. His argument,** that there is no reason to amend existing legislation on euthanasia **was accepted by the jurists, informed the outcome of the investigation and is reflected in the recommendations of its 2016 final report which the government have accepted**. The final report \( **S1**\) cites Yuill’s book and the Committee member confirms that it played a significant role in the inquiry \( **S2**\). 

 **New Zealand:** In 2015, a case in the New Zealand High Court challenged the law on euthanasia. Yuill contributed to the debate about the trial in the media \( **S3**\) and stimulated public discussion of the topic through invited appearances at awareness\-raising events organised by Euthanasia\-Free New Zealand in Auckland, Hamilton and Wellington. Comments from the audience include “ *I was pro\-assisted suicide, **but these two talks changed my mind**” and “\[Yuill\] *outlined a new perspective which has been useful and **strengthened my opposition**” \( **S3**\). In 2016 Yuill submitted evidence to the debate on the End of Life Choices Bill in New Zealand’s Parliament \( **S4**\). **The NZ Health Select Committee took this written testimony and invited him to give oral evidence** in March 2017 \( **S4**\). In line with Yuill’s position, the committee recommended that no changes to current practice were necessary \( **S5**\). Yuill was **subsequently invited** **to write a submission** to a new assisted suicide bill \(which proposed to give people with a terminal illness or a grievous and irremediable medical condition the option of requesting assisted dying\) **by the** **former head of the NZ Health Select Committee**, who wrote that “ *I am very conscious of your expertise and interest in the matter*” and that “ *those in the sector, here and overseas, speak very highly of your insights*” \( **S6**\). Dr. David E. Richmond of the University of Auckland, in his testimony to the Bill, held \( **R1**\) up as “ **one of the best critical analyses of Bills such as this**” \( **S7**\). 

 **USA:** Yuill’s research **informed the official position of the American College of Physicians,** published in October 2017 **.** His work is cited in their position paper \( **S8**\) to support their warning that “ *making physicians arbiters of assisted suicide is a return to paternalism and not a power physicians should want*” and carries through into their conclusion that “ *Control over the manner and timing of a person’s death has not been and should not be a goal of medicine*”. 

 **Denmark:** The Danish Council of Ethics is a government\-mandated independent body that advises policymakers on current issues. A council member who routinely advises politicians and the public about ethical issues says that during the assessment period he has often drawn upon the “ *splendid observations*” Yuill makes in his historical research \( **S9**\). 

 <ins>Impact on public discussion and debate</ins> 

 Yuill has drawn on his research to animate and diversify public debate about assisted suicide in general, and more recently, on assisted suicide during the COVID\-19 pandemic \( **S3**\). **The combined reach of his media appearances during the assessment period is in excess of 9 million people around the world** \(see table\). His contributions include articles in mainstream and specialist media, broadcast debates with prominent thinkers and journalists, and print, TV and radio interviews. He participated in debates at the 2017 Belief and Beyond Belief Festival \(UK\) and the 2019 Battle of Ideas \(UK\), and in 2016 gave the Telders Lecture, a prestigious annual lecture at the Telders Foundation \(Netherlands\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study describes how training practices for interpreters and psychotherapists working in the NHS, private therapy and the voluntary sector have improved, enabling psychotherapists to more effectively and compassionately treat vulnerable patients who do not have English as their first language. Some of the most vulnerable members of society have been reached; asylum seekers and refugees are especially vulnerable and in need of this support and care, in addition to NHS and counselling service users, the voluntary sector, Migration and Domestic Violence Services, Probation and Social Services, Charities, and small NGOs. As a consequence of this training, therapists report higher levels of confidence and understanding, and patients report higher levels of satisfaction. The approach has been endorsed by the UK government and its model has been integrated into NHS mental health services, resulting in easier access to services for speakers of non\-English languages. 

 Training for the British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists has informed training in higher and further education settings and shaped the work of numerous small and voluntary sector organisations offering psychotherapy and counselling. Free online training resources have benefited small organizations that could not otherwise afford to train staff. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Jean\-Marc Dewaele’s book, *Emotions in Multiple Languages* \(A\), demonstrated that multilinguals’ first language\(s\) **\(L1\) have more emotional resonance** than foreign languages \(LX\) and that L1\(s\) are typically preferred to communicate emotions even after the LX\(s\) have become the preferred language, which happens after affective socialisation in the LX. One consequence of this is **the detachment effect,** which may cause multilingual people to feel emotionally inauthentic when speaking in LX, but also conversely that using LX can also allow them to disclose **and process trauma** that would be simply too painful to discuss in their L1. **Code\-switching** \(switching between languages\) was also found to be linked to raised emotionality in interactions. 

 After reading *Emotions in Multiple Languages,* Beverley Costa, CEO and clinical director of Mothertongue, approached Dewaele to undertake research on multilingualism and emotions in the context of mental health. Costa subsequently became an Honorary Research Fellow. 

 Dewaele and Costa’s collaborative and cross\-disciplinary mixed\-methods research examined the problems facing both therapists and patients who were English LX users \(Costa & Dewaele, 2012 \(B\), 2019\(E\); Dewaele & Costa, 2013 \(C\); Rolland et al., 2017, 2020\) \(D, F\). The research was the first to collect quantitative and qualitative data from over one hundred therapists and multilingual patients and thus marked a departure from the traditional case studies in the field. Statistical analyses and thematic analyses of interview data revealed that patients who are LX users in English may feel alienated when therapists ignore their multilingualism and multiculturalism which are a central part of their identity and do not allow them to bring their L1 in the room when needed. 

 Research into multilingualism and therapy suggest that multilingual clients are different from monolingual clients \(A; C; D; F\). More specifically, they feel they have a different identity in each of their languages; they may express different emotions in their different languages; they make more rational/utilitarian decisions in their LX; they can process trauma more effectively in one or other of their languages; they may only remember early memories in the language in which they were encoded. Moreover, clients appreciate when psychological therapists create a linguistically empathic space where all of their languages are welcome, where a foreign accent is not frowned upon and where multilingualism is viewed as a potential therapeutic asset rather than a problem or something to be ignored.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Costa and Dewaele’s research and its active dissemination of the main findings through clinical training has raised awareness about multilingualism **and multilingual identity as a therapeutic asset,** leading to improved practices of UK therapists dealing with LX users of English and ultimately benefiting some of the most vulnerable and traumatised groups in society. 

 New training and forms of clinical supervision have been developed as a direct result of Dewaele and Costa’s research \(A, E\). The training reinforces the importance of allowing the clients’ languages in the therapy session, even if these are unknown to the therapist, and the realisation that this does not constitute a threat to the authority of the therapist. By allowing clients to use their full linguistic repertoire, therapists allow clients who may struggle in English to maintain their dignity and to show their multicultural identity. Finally, it emphasises the importance of recognising that language switching happens at critical emotional junctures \(A; 1\) in a session and these instances deserve particular attention. 

 2 types of training for different target groups were developed based on studies by Costa and Dewaele \(A, B, C, E, F\). The first type of session was for psychological therapy practitioners in general and focused on the assumptions of psychological therapists about their ability to work in English with a multilingual client for whom English is an LX and whether the client’s multilingualism is significant to the therapy. This training was the first time that these issues have been included in psychological training curricula. The second type of training built specifically on the findings of \(B\) and led to greater confidence in multilingual practitioners to work effectively in a language in which they have not trained. 

 The training has helped to build the confidence of practitioners to consider, for instance, incorporating a linguistic history into the assessment process; discussing linguistic privilege and power with regard to the concept of “native speakers” and foreign accents; initiating a conversation about identity and language; evaluating when, how and if to invite a client to use their different languages in the therapy room when processing trauma; and the therapeutic value of speaking in one language or another. 

 Between 2013 and 2020, Costa trained in the region of 3,640 practitioners through her support services Mothertongue and Pásalo CIC \(2\). This figure represents all of the training discussed below. The importance of these therapeutic skills should not be understated – LX clients are often extremely vulnerable; empowering them to speak in the language in which they feel safest and most comfortable is vital. Findings demonstrate that some multilingual clients may struggle to express themselves in their LX \(C\), while others feel safer to do so due to the ‘detachment effect’ of speaking in a foreign language. Each individual is unique and benefits from services that are adaptable. Although this case study broadly describes the impacts on therapists, the ultimate beneficiaries are the clients, who through Costa’s training have been empowered by their therapists to work through their emotions and trauma as individuals with unique linguistic needs. 

 **Mothertongue:** Costa established Mothertongue as a charity in 2000 to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive counselling and mental health intervention to people from black and minority communities in the languages of their choice. Costa and Dewaele’s research led to a greater awareness of and respect for Mothertongue’s culturally\-sensitive professional counselling services, and in improved training practices for interpreters and psychotherapists. A comprehensive training programme was developed for psychotherapists and counsellors working in the NHS, private therapy and the voluntary sector. Clients who used Mothertongue directly were referred by the NHS Migration and Domestic Violence Services, and by Probation and Social Services. 

 Beyond this, through Mothertongue Costa has trained therapy trainees and qualified therapists practicing in IAPT, Child and Adolescent Mental Health \(CAMH\) teams, clinical psychology, and trainees on psychotherapy training programmes \(3\), who consistently demonstrate greater confidence and understanding in working with LX clients. 

 Clinicians reported higher levels of patient satisfaction and appreciation when their multilingual identities were acknowledged and respected. 

 Mothertongue’s model of practice has now been integrated into the Berkshire NHS IAPT \(Talking Therapies\) psychotherapy services, employing Mothertongue\-trained interpreters as NHS workers, resulting in easier access to services for speakers of non\-English languages. Trust clinicians have gained invaluable insight and knowledge, enriching staff experience improving the client experience. New practice resulting from this intervention is now firmly embedded at the Trust in which senior clinicians either lead or attend supervision sessions \(4\). The frontline work of the charity Mothertongue was concluded in 2018 after the successful integration of its interpreter service and elements of its therapy model into the Trust’s Mental Health Service. 

 **Pásalo CIC:** Costa launched the Pásalo Project in 2017 as a Community Interest Company \(CIC\). A CIC is a more nimble and dynamic organisational structure than a charity; this structure suits the non\-frontline dissemination and expansion of the learning from the work that Mothertongue initiated. In 2018, Pásalo was awarded funding by the Big Lottery to provide cultural and linguistic training and supervision to small organisations which would otherwise be unable to afford the training. Spaces were filled months prior to the start date of March 2018, while requests for multilingualism in therapy training continue. 

 Practitioners working with the terminally ill and bereaved family members were trained through Pásalo to work with multilingual clients. Case workers and clinicians from five refugee organisations, working with the most traumatised members of our communities, have been trained. This model of training is easily replicated and available to the least well\-resourced workers working with a highly vulnerable client group. Due to its success, funding was awarded again in 2019, while additional funding to work with organisations in Wales was awarded, also in 2019. The impact of this model is particularly significant because of the overall lack of resource for vulnerable client groups. In 2020, Pásalo CIC was awarded funding by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation to create a free online CPD training resource on mental health and multilingualism. This includes six short films from psychological therapy with multilingual clients. The resource will ensure the widest possible reach for practitioners to work with multilingual mental health clients  [https://www.pasaloproject.org/multilingualism\-mental\-health\-and\-psychological\-therapy\-\-\-course\-content.html](https://www.pasaloproject.org/multilingualism-mental-health-and-psychological-therapy---course-content.html). 

 The Pásalo Project continues to train practitioners, including Speech and Language Therapists at the University of Reading and the Masters programme for Public Service Interpreters at the University of Alcalá, Spain. In 2020, Pásalo created an e\-learning resource for the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy: The Social Response Cycle \- about effective therapeutically framed social action \( [https://www.bacp.co.uk/cpd/social\-response\-cycle\-member\-resource/](https://www.bacp.co.uk/cpd/social-response-cycle-member-resource/)\) \(5\). 

 The British Association for Counsellors and Psychotherapists recommends that practitioners provide around 20 sessions per week with multiple clients. Assuming a thirty\-year career for each of the 3,640 practitioners who received training through Mothertongue and Pásalo, and a 48\-week working year, this equates to nearly 30,000 sessions per counsellor. For all counsellors Costa has trained, the number of sessions is in the region of one hundred million. The number of people living in the UK for whom English is a second language is around 7%, so assuming that approximately 5% of service users fall into this category, 5% of the overall sessions equates to over 5,000,000 sessions directly benefiting from Costa’s training.\* 

 These sessions often reach the most vulnerable people in society and those most in need of support, including victims of domestic abuse, refugees and asylum seekers. While it is hard to pinpoint exact numbers of those groups that have been reached, we do know that therapists have overwhelmingly benefited from Costa’s training, and that they are passing those benefits on to their clients. 

 **Bager\-Charleson:** In 2017, Sofie Bager\-Charleson \(1\) published a study with Dewaele and Costa on therapists’ experiences of undertaking awareness\-raising training about multilingualism. Analysis showed that clinicians trained to understand multilingualism consistently reported feeling more confident to work with patients’ multilingualism as a therapeutic asset in treatment. 

 Clinicians trained by Costa consistently report that the techniques developed from Dewaele and Costa’s research are helping patients to use treatment for anxiety and depression \- especially trauma \- more effectively, aiding their recovery. Indeed, Bager\-Charleson’s \(1\) evaluation of the training programme showed that it raised awareness of how ‘language is a path into “a whole world of understanding and experiences”’ and not using a client’s mother tongue limited access to their world. Bager\-Charleson’s positive assessment of Costa’s training holds true in direct feedback, too. Practitioners trained in 2018 and 2019 awarded the sessions an average score of 9.4 out of 10 for usefulness \(6\), while qualitative comments from IAPT trainees demonstrate the sessions’ impact on clinical practice: ‘I now explore with bilingual clients if they feel a greater connection \[…\] to either language and adapt language chosen’; ‘I \[now\] invite in client’s first language if they are describing past events’; ‘\[I encourage\] clients to use phrases or words from their native language’; ‘I have now negotiated with my manager to have more time to write up clinical notes in English when I have been working with a patient in Polish’. 

 **British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy \(BACP\):** Costa has delivered supervision training across the UK for BACP and has informed the work of numerous small and voluntary sector organisations offering mental health services and counselling to victims of domestic violence, asylum seekers and refugees, and parents of children in hospices. Furthermore, individuals working in these organisations received training directly from Costa \(6\). 

 **IAPT / Further and Higher Education:** Costa taught on Reading University’s IAPT training in 2018\-19 and 2019\-2020, as part of the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences PYMBAS module, covering foundation skills in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, as part of the core curriculum to trainee Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners \(PWPs\). Further sessions were delivered as part of the PWP Supervision training \(7\). Additionally, Costa has trained clinicians and trainees at further and higher education institutions; IAPT therapists and supervisors have been trained at the Universities of Southampton and East Anglia \(7, 8, 9\); trainee Clinical Psychologists at the University of Oxford; trainee Speech and Language Therapists at the University of Reading; trainee Counselling Psychologists and Psychotherapists at the Metanoia Institute; trainee clinical supervisors via the BACP; and trainee counsellors at Cardiff And Vale College. Southampton University’s Low Intensity \(LI\) CBT Programmes Group Manager attested that Costa sessions for PWPs and High Intensity Therapists \(HITs\) were considered by ‘our programme teams to be an extremely valuable and useful session \[there is\] an enormous amount of value \[…\] for the students’. Furthermore, Costa also delivered a similar session to PWPs for the Education Mental Health Practitioner \(EMHP\) training. The Group Manager noted that although it was not part of the national curriculum, the value that it added for EMHPs was indispensable \(9\). 

 Costa’s training and new resources have continued to benefit therapists into the latter part of the impact period. Early in 2020, Costa developed a new online training resource on multilingualism and mental health, that included an accompanying film, *Language of the Heart,* both of which were produced through Pásalo. The course is for therapists, counsellors, trainees, supervisors, trainers, social workers and anyone interested in mental health and multilingualism. The course takes up to 12 hours to complete and participants receive a CPD certificate for on receipt of their evaluation. Because the training is currently in its trial form it is being offered free of charge and is therefore an opportunity to achieve 12 hours of CPD for free. Although the resources were originally due to be trialled earlier in 2020, they were delayed until lockdown restrictions were lifted. Ultimately, the online resource and film were launched on 14 December 2020. In its opening week alone, 115 people accessed it and 22 completed it and sent in evaluation reports, while at the film’s initial screening 100 people attended.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Leigh Landy’s research into listening to, learning about and creating electroacoustic music has changed appreciation and understanding of a genre that was previously almost completely absent from school curricula. An eLearning site, EARS 2, and creative software, Compose with Sounds \(CwS\), have expanded music education and encouraged artistic potential among targeted age groups, particularly pre\- and young teens; by late 2020 there were 20,000 monthly EARS 2 online visitors. Since late October 2013 over 4,000 people \(teachers and students\) around the world have attended hundreds of workshops, classroom sessions and other events. Educational materials are now available in 10 languages, directly resulting in ministries, educators and cultural organisations in 5 countries having promoted the widespread adoption of sound\-based music education in classrooms. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 It is no easy task making innovative music, in this case electroacoustic \(sound\-based, not note\-based\) music, accessible. Although digital electroacoustic sounds are ubiquitous today, the gap between current and potential appreciation and participation levels remains substantial. Over three decades, Landy’s research has aimed to make sound\-based music relevant to music educators and enthusiasts, by determining potential interest, facilitating increased participation and influencing educational policy. 

 **\(1\) EARS \(ELECTROACOUSTIC RESOURCE SITE\) PROJECT** 

 Landy conceived the EARS project in 2001 as a resource, with a glossary, a subject index and a bibliography, that would enable people, mainly university\-level students and professionals, to engage with the challenge of terminology and find literature related to their own interests, see who was working in an area similar to their own, and identify potential gaps in research. Over a six\-year period, over 500 terms and 5,000 bibliographic entries were added and many translated into French, German, Spanish and Italian by an international consortium of specialists \[R1, G1, G2\]. 

 **\(2\) INTENTION/RECEPTION \(I/R\) PROJECT** 

 From 2001, Landy’s I/R project has set out to examine to what extent electroacoustic composers’ intentions are being received by listeners of various levels of experience, and to what extent listeners with no previous experience of electroacoustic music might be interested in further exposure to similar works. From 2003 to 2007 in Leicestershire, and in 2019 \(as part of Interfaces\) \[G5\] elsewhere in the UK and Greece, around 800 participants from schools and workshops completed questionnaires and talked informally during and after a music session. A quantitative data analysis showed that electroacoustic works are more accessible than the researchers anticipated: between 55% and 79% of listeners were interested in further exposure to sound\-based music. Data gained from this project led Landy to his educational initiatives, in particular, EARS 2/​CwS \[R2\]. 

 **\(3\) SOUND ORGANISER \(LATER, COMPOSE WITH SOUNDS, OR CwS\)** 

 In 2007 Landy organised the design of a prototype for Sound Organiser, audio software that is based on a computer games approach: the higher the level one reaches, the greater the palette of opportunities and challenges on offer. In 2013 this was renamed and launched as Compose with Sounds \(CwS\) \[R4\], an intuitive, easy\-to\-learn, free composition software with powerful forms of sound manipulation which allow users to compose music creatively with any sounds. 

 **\(4\) EARS 2** 

 In 2008 UNESCO, a supporter of EARS, asked Landy to create an ‘EARS for children’. With DMU education specialist Dr Motje Wolf, Landy investigated the feasibility of supporting several countries’ national curricula for music while broadening the horizon of their offer in terms of sonic creativity \[G3–G5\]. Wolf created EARS 2 Teachers’ Packs, and in 2012 Landy published the first comprehensive book on sonic creativity for teachers working with 11\- to 14\-year\-olds, *Making Music with Sounds* \[R3\]. Its structure ensured that EARS 2 could be easily navigated by music novices. The incorporation of CwS into EARS 2 in 2013 offered a complete learning and creative environment for people, especially students at Key Stage 3 with no previous knowledge of sound\-based music \[R5\]. Extensive user feedback from the start has led to continual enhancements \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Professor Landy’s research into electroacoustic music made a compelling case for its accessibility in terms of both appreciation and activity, and informed its inclusion in the music education and creative participation of young people aged 11–14, older students and adults in countries across the world. The resources have been translated into French, Spanish, Greek, Czech, Portuguese, Italian, German, Swedish and Norwegian and endorsed by ministries of education and cultural organisations in Greece, Cyprus, France, the UK and Mexico. In December 2020 there were 20,210 visitors to the website, almost double the previous peak of 11,025 visitors in January 2018 \[C1\]. 

 **\(1\) IMPACT ON LEARNING AND PARTICIPATION: ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN SONIC CREATIVITY** 

 From 2011 to 2013, the EU’s cultural programme supported the CwS initiative, focusing on the creation of the initial CwS platform for EARS 2. The platform was widely used in \(mainly\) secondary schools in the UK, France, Germany, Greece, Norway and Portugal, and its website went live in October 2013. 

 For their compositions, music students collected a diversity of sounds, from the domestic \(a coffee cup clattering in the sink\) to the ethereal \(a waterfall in a gorge\) and, with the help of teachers and composers, transformed them into a piece of music with the software. A teacher at the Conservatoire in Bourges, France, said about the composition ‘Retour aux Sources’: ‘I only used sounds in this piece that were generated by the children as part of their activities related to inventing sounds and composing with them’ \[C2\]. 

 Between 2016 and 2019, Landy and Wolf worked with the Leicester\-Shire Music Education Hub, a collaboration of local educators, composers and community artists, to develop and run 47 EARS 2/​CwS workshops with more than 400 participants at 7 schools \(ages 9–15\) in Leicester, Leamington Spa and Coventry, as well as 3 community settings \(with a wider age range\). When asked if they would like to listen to or make sound\-based compositions again, participants’ responses included: ‘Yes, because the sounds sound like music, even if they originally weren’t’ \(Year 5, girl\); ‘It’s fun to find new sounds and experiment with them’ \(Year 9, boy\); and ‘I really enjoyed the opportunity to be creative and express my own ideas’ \(teacher\) \[C3\]. A Year 6 music teacher praised the teachers’ resources as previously the subject had been ‘out of her comfort zone’ \[C4\]. 

 The head of music technology at the Hub, said that EARS 2/​CwS ‘demands no musical literacy’ and can be ‘shared by all’. ‘EARS 2 is what one might call a “complete curriculum”, covering a wide range of topics \(breadth\) at various learning levels \(depth\). As far as I know, it is completely unique and also extremely valuable, not least in terms of our National Curriculum’ \[C4\]. Although further workshops have been largely on hold during 2020, he has formally recommended the ‘low\-anxiety’ resources for use in other hubs’ geographic areas on the website \[C4\]. 

 **\(2\) IMPACT ON CULTURE AND SOCIETY: BRINGING NEW MUSIC TO NEW AUDIENCES** 

 Following the success of the CwS project, from June 2016 to September 2020 DMU was a partner in the EU’s Interfaces project \[C5\] with the aim of ‘bringing new music to new audiences’ through community arts projects, performances, site\-specific events and workshops. Besides funding the phase 2 development of EARS 2/​CwS \(e.g. multiple languages\) \[G6\], Interfaces has enabled translations and workshop opportunities, as well as creating pathways for official endorsements \(NB: EARS 2 was cyber\-attacked in May 2018 and not publicly available for a number of months until fully rebuilt; CwS also underwent significant recoding due to Windows/​Mac OS upgrades as reflected in, for example, C3\). 

 A freelance composer and musician conducted community workshops in 2017 and 2018 for adults aged 18 and over in the UK and Greece, involving 230 school students, 70 tertiary students, 60 adults in community workshops, 10 teachers and 77 experts \[C5\]. Referring to the eLearning platform and software as ‘intuitive for starters’, he says: ‘Our experiences with \[them\] have clearly demonstrated that, not only is this a way of engaging more people in creative practice, but it offers a unique “way in” to a wider range of participants than many of the more traditional genre\-based approaches’ \[C3\]. He continued to use EARS 2/​CwS during the pandemic, in online workshops for young people organised by Scotland’s Sound Festival in April 2020 \[C3\]. 

 In 2018 Landy conducted a two\-day workshop in Prague for 60 HE students from Charles University and the National Academy of Performing Arts \(AMU\). An Associate Professor of Composition at AMU wrote: ‘Many Charles students \[media\] not only plan to use the software again, but are enthusiastic about using sound\-based sampling in their work’. ‘\[One\] of the participants, having been introduced to the EARS 2 website in your first day session even proposed to make a Czech version of it’. She completed this in 2020. Some documentation of the workshop can be found \[C7\]. 

 **\(3\) IMPACT ON MUSIC EDUCATION POLICY: PROMOTING SOUND\-BASED MUSIC LESSONS IN SCHOOLS** 

 With the implementation of language translations and cultural adaptations to the new versions of EARS 2/​CwS in the late 2020, benefits have been achieved in a number of countries where ministries, cultural institutions and music education specialists have advocated for the widespread adoption of the revised resources and tools in schools. 

 In the UK, Sound and Music, an affiliate of Arts Council England that supports the creation and enjoyment of new music, has endorsed EARS 2/​CwS for use in schools and workshops on its website and in newsletters to young people and educators, reaching 325 and 987 people respectively \[C6\]. 

 In 2014 in Cyprus, the music inspector for secondary education at the Ministry of Education and Culture, says: ‘The Ministry made the decision to recommend the use of Compose with Sounds in our Music Schools and in the music classroom as part of our national curriculum’. In consequence there is an ‘increased number of events in Cyprus that include electroacoustic music and concerts with electroacoustic music compositions from our students’ \[C8\]. It was the first country to do so following a workshop by Landy and a music technology teacher in Cyprus \[C8\]. Since then, 250 students have been introduced to the software \[C8\]. 

 After introductions in schools in Greece in 2014 and again in 2017 from our partner, Ionian University \[C9\], teachers felt that they needed a Greek\-language learning environment. An online demonstration of EARS 2/CwS and its potential in educational contexts in late 2020, attended by over 150 teachers and which remains available online, prompted the Greek Society for Music Education \(GSME\) to recommend EARS 2/​CwS for use in all Greek schools, especially at post\-primary level \(> 3,000 schools\) \[C9\]. Without a national curriculum, GSME is where ‘music teachers come for information on new valuable developments’, says the GSME president. ‘We feel it is our responsibility to encourage dynamic, up to date music teaching. Making music with sounds is something that \[children\] should all learn about and make’ \[C9\]. 

 Mexico’s National Centre for Music and Sonic Arts \(CMMAS\) provides local, state and national authorities with suggestions regarding educational tools for music and encourages their integration into schools’ music programmes. Following their translation and cultural adaptation \(which CMMAS oversaw\) into Spanish in 2020, ‘these resources are now ideal for Mexican and Latin American schools’, says the director of CMMAS. ‘We are officially endorsing their use … particularly for late primary and early secondary levels and for community artists working in the field’. He added that, ‘the ability for children to quickly become enthusiastic and well informed about various forms of electro\-acoustic music is just what our schools need. Offering them the chance to be creative and gain confidence in their creativity regardless of available tools is just what our country needs’ \[C10\]. 

 In France, the Inspé d’Aix\-Marseille \(National Higher Institute of Education and Teaching at Aix\-Marseille University\) ‘trains and provides guidance and recommendation to primary and secondary school teachers in France’. Their team ‘made a rigorous analysis of the pedagogical approach provided by this resource’ and concluded that EARS 2/​CwS ‘offer a major contribution to the pedagogy of acousmatic music’ and ‘make a major contribution to the development of the abilities of a large number of students regarding the perception and production of electroacoustic music’. The platforms support ‘the development of their skills in the two central activities of the French musical education curriculum: perception and production’ \[C11\].

","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Imprint project was a collaboration between its PI, Philippa Hoskin \(University of Lincoln\), and Co\-I, Elizabeth New \(Aberystwyth University\). The key starting point was Hoskin’s role as General Editor and Director of the British Academy\-funded English Episcopal Act project, which publishes editions of the administrative documents that were crucial to the running of medieval bishops’ dioceses. This work developed into Hoskin’s research on sealing \- the method by which parties authenticated and signalled their consent to a document’s contents by using a matrix to impress a unique design onto a wax seal attached to the document.  Hoskin became particularly interested in the possibility of analysing the handprints that survive on the wax – a resource hitherto unexplored by historians. She designed a pilot project in conjunction with New, funded by the University of Lincoln \(2013\), where 200 medieval seals from Hereford Cathedral were examined by forensic scientists – the first such analysis to be undertaken. This established the feasibility of the methodology developed by Hoskin and New and led directly into the AHRC\-funded project, Imprint \(January 2016\-December 2018, Hoskin as PI\). 

 Since, by the thirteenth century, a wide variety of institutions and individuals owned matrices, their motifs and text provide invaluable evidence about identity and representation, especially as the documents to which seals were often attached survive in great numbers in British archives. Imprint analysed 1000 handprints on seals and made a number of important discoveries about the practice of sealing and its role in public display. In particular, Imprint overturned the prevailing assumption that an individual needed to physically impress their own matrix into a wax seal – this action was often performed by third parties. Other key findings related to: 1\) the use of different seal motifs in varying social groups and geographical areas; 2\) the practice of sealing by women; and 3\) the composition and origin of medieval wax. These findings have been published in a number of articles and essays by Hoskin \(see section 3\). 

 The project’s key research output, though, is  [www.imprintseals.org](http://www.imprintseals.org/) \- an open access database of 1000 medieval seals, that includes high\-quality images of the handprints on the wax, made with cutting\-edge forensic equipment. The process of creating these images led directly to improvements in the operation of the equipment. The database also created and connected colour images of the matrix impressions and the documents, providing information about the parties and contents of the documents, the wording and motifs on the seals, and the nature and quality of the handprints. It also links impressions of the same matrix and of the same handprints, drawing on forensic techniques of both manual and digital analysis. Research on handprints on medieval seals that was previously impossible can now be completed in a matter of minutes. Unlocking the information in this pioneering way has democratized its use for everyone interested in medieval history and the history of handprints.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The project’s impact is multifaceted, interacting with businesses, forensic scientists, heritage professionals and the general public. It has demonstrated how medieval sources can be used to solve modern technical and professional problems, as well as developing heritage practices and allowing the public to explore medieval history in new ways, providing free access to a hitherto inaccessible area of medieval life and work. 

 **Improving Technical Equipment**. Whilst working with scientists to examine the handprints found on the back of medieval wax seals, the Imprint project is having an impact upon forensic science and the makers of forensic instruments. Imprint’s use of the multispectral Crime Lite Imager \(CLI; usually used for crime\-scene analysis\) in unusual circumstances with challenging materials, in a variety of different environments, has allowed both forensic specialists and the equipment’s creators, Foster & Freeman Ltd, to discover more about how the equipment works under different environmental circumstances, and this has enabled them to make improvements to the ‘usability and stability’ of both the hardware and software of the CLI \[5:1\]. 

 **Furthering Scientific Discovery**.  The forensic partners on the project, Forensic Focus Ltd, have also been able to discover new information about the extent of the distortion of prints on uneven surfaces and malleable materials and about the effect on print quality and preservation of different chemical components mixed with wax \[5.2\]. As Forensic Focus say: ‘the project is assisting modern day forensic science with respect to effective image capture of marks on highly curved surfaces, an issue we have battled with for years’ \[5.3\]. 

 **Protecting and Interpreting the National Heritage**.  The project had five partner heritage institutions \(Westminster Abbey, the National Library of Wales and Hereford, Exeter and Lincoln Cathedrals\), for whom it provided conservation surveys of medieval seals and associated material, leading directly to improved conservation practices \(e.g. bespoke protective pouches to preserve seals\). The Archivist of Exeter Cathedral commented: ‘The successful long\-term preservation of these documents is now much more secure’ as a result of Imprint’s work \[5.4\]. The project has also increased knowledge amongst heritage professionals about cataloguing and interpreting seals, facilitated outreach sessions and through its database has enhanced the material digitally available at each archive \[5.4 & 5.5\]. Furthermore, the CLI has been used to help in the understanding of aspects \(e.g. dry point drawings\) of exceptionally significant cultural items, including the Exeter Book \(UNESCO Memory of the World status\) \[5.4\]. More widely, the project has also shared its findings at a workshop for professionals on digital experimentation and archives at The National Archives \(28 June 2018\) \[5.8,p.3\]. 

 **Improving Professional and Public Knowledge of Medieval Life**.  Imprint has also provided workshops and public lectures to both heritage professionals and the general public, furthering knowledge of medieval seals and the project’s findings, and encouraging new ways of thinking about medieval life. These have included public workshops at Exeter, Hereford, and London \(2018\) that engaged with conservation professionals, archivists, local historians and palmistry experts and received extremely positive feedback \[5.6\]. Workshops on sealing for year 7 students in schools enhanced their work on medieval history and particularly on medieval documents \(such as Magna Carta\) \- school staff commented on the ‘invaluable’ learning experience the workshop provided \[5.7\]. Imprint has also contributed to public festivals, including the European Commission\-funded LiGHTS Nights events in September 2016 and 2017 and the Festival of Creativity, University of Lincoln, May 2017, and in staging further public exhibitions, for example a pop\-up exhibition of medieval women’s seals at Corpus Christi College Oxford \(January 2018\). Hoskin and New have also given a range of talks, including at Magdalen College, Oxford \(5 June 2017\) and a public lecture at the Society of Antiquaries on 25 April 2017 \[5.8\]. The project has featured in popular magazines, including *BBC History Magazine* in January 2016, and *New Scientist* in December 2016. People are also drawn to the project website through interactive tweets and blogs \[5.8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In an effort to address the social marginalization of an ageing population, this research conducted in Italy has enabled older people’s participation in the creation of cultural heritage, while enhancing their wellbeing through reminiscence activities. The project has captured memories of Italian cinema audience members \(who in 2013 were over 65 of age\), thus rescuing and preserving intangible cultural heritage for future generations. By co\-creating a digital archive, the project has ensured the sustainability of this legacy while enabling older people’s digital inclusion beyond the project’s lifetime. Moreover, the research has fostered intergenerational collaborations between older and younger audiences, furthered younger generations’ involvement in a community forged through cinema\-going and enhanced public understanding of Italian cultural heritage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Funded by a substantial Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) award, *Italian Cinema Audiences* **\(R1a\)** was a collaborative research project involving Oxford Brookes University \(as Principal Investigator\), the University of Bristol and the University of Exeter. It explored for the first time cinema audiences in Italy in the 1950s. Using oral history methodologies the project gathered cinema\-going memories from over 1,200 participants across eight Italian regions. With the assistance of our project partners UNITRE \(University of the Third Age in Italy\) and Memoro \(Memory Bank, an international non\-profit organisation dedicated to the collection of memories and life stories of people born before 1950\), these memories were captured using a combination of questionnaires and individual video\-interviews. These personal accounts have been contextualised with a variety of archival sources \(press reviews, box\-office figures, and film industry data\), allowing us to uncover the hidden side of Italian film history: its spectators **\(R2a\)**. 

 In February 2017, *Italian Cinema Audiences* launched the next phase of its research: the development of CINERICORDI \(based at Oxford Brookes University and funded by the AHRC Follow\-on Funding, specifically aimed at research dissemination and impact\) **\(R1b\)**. CINERICORDI **\(R2b\)** is an online interactive archive where the general public can explore the history of Italian cinema\-going through the memories of its audiences. The digital archive integrated our collected data \(questionnaires, video\-interviews, and cartographical data on 1950s cinemas\) with new and unexplored archival resources, including digitised artefacts related to cinema\-going, as well as crowd\-sourced collections from older cinema\-goers’ private archives \(comprising of photos, programmes, leaflets, private letters, signed posters, etc.\) **\(R3\)**. 

 Led by Daniela Treveri Gennari as Principal Investigator, with an interdisciplinary team of international experts on Italian cinema and culture, this research has provided the first nationwide study of cinema audiences in post\-war Italy. It was an innovative collaboration between universities, public and private archives, members of the general public and cultural organizations. The research has pioneered a process of rewriting history from “below”. By offering insight into audiences’ experiences, the project has empowered these protagonists and challenged the traditional top\-down understanding of Italian film culture, going beyond canonical histories of Italian cinema dominated by great auteurs and renowned movements such as Neorealism **\(R4\)**. 

 The international significance of this research has resulted in the adoption of the *Italian Cinema Audiences* model for further studies. These include the British Academy/Leverhulme\-funded *Mapping European cinema: a comparative project on cinema\-going experiences in the 1950s* \(2016–2017\) **\(R1c\)** and the AHRC\-funded *European Cinema Audiences* project \(2018–2021\), both led by Treveri Gennari **\(R1d\)**. The latter is the first large scale qualitative comparative study of cinema audiences in post\-war Europe. As with the *Italian Cinema Audiences* project, the memories of the cohort were used to investigate the personal, cultural and social significance of cinema\-going for European audiences. These memories enhance Europe’s multi\-vocal cultural heritage as a shared common history, curating it for future generations. 

 The innovative contribution to scholarship has been recognised by the international academic community \(the model has been adapted by other academics, for example, Dr Asa Jernudd’s *Swedish Cinema and Everyday Life: A study of cinema\-going in its peak and decline* project funded by the Swedish Research Council\). It has also raised awareness and understanding of the importance of autobiographical memories for the elderly **\(R5\)**. Moreover, the project has identified how the older generation can bridge the digital divide, becoming the curators of an online archive of the cinema\-going experience **\(R6\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The cinema audience research has had an impact in two main areas: ‘creativity, culture and society’ and ‘understanding, learning and participation’. Moreover, it has impacted positively on the social welfare and wellbeing of older people. 

 CINERICORDI has developed an accessible digital archive \(with 6,900 page views since April 2018\) that allows the general public to explore and contribute to a new history of Italian cinema\-going through the sharing of personal memories. It gathers data collected in *Italian Cinema Audiences* with further crowd\-sourced visual material \(over 1,200 items\) donated by cinema\-goers in Italy. Enabling older people’s participation in cultural heritage creation and preservation has been demonstrated to enhance their wellbeing, confirming the utility and success of the co\-creation practice, as highlighted in a report by Age UK ‘Creative and Cultural Activities and Wellbeing in Later Life’ \(2018: 3\). In fact, the main beneficiaries of this research\-led engagement were older people, who have been largely ignored in the creation of culture, especially in digital and online contexts. Through CINERICORDI they have become part of a community forged through cinema\-going: this has enabled them to be at the forefront of reconstructing the history of post\-war Italian film culture, traditionally only written by film scholars. 

 Ten public engagement events were held across Italy and three in the UK \(with over 1,000 participants between the two countries\) **\(S1\)**. Through collaborating with UNITRE \(which shared access to their national network of over 80,000 members\), 200 older participants have shared their positive feedback on these events and highlighted the benefit generated by the project’s activities both in terms of their sense of inclusion and valorization of their cinema memories: *“People my age feel the need to tell about themselves to realise that they exist”; “The recovery of memories feeds self\-esteem\!\!\!”; “It helps us remember and stimulates our relationship with others”.* Many have also highlighted the pleasure they feel in the process of remembering: *“They make me relive the good times”; “\[the project\] is helpful in remembering pleasant things”; “memories hidden and forgotten in a drawer, dug out with your help”.* **\(S2**\) Furthermore, CINERICORDI has inspired the creation of new knowledge and cultural expression amongst its participants. This includes: a book on cinemas in Amelia \(Italy\) written by one of the participants and presented at the Turin International Book Fair \(one of the largest book fairs in Europe\) **\(S3\)**; an exhibition on film culture in Manduria \(Italy\), which attracted around 1,500 visitors in one week **\(S4\)**; and research on local cinemas in Messina \(Italy\) **\(S5\)**. 

 Importantly, the project has rescued and preserved intangible cultural heritage for future generations. It has captured memories of Italian culture and created an accessible digital archive to ensure the sustainability of this legacy. A training programme delivered to the UNITRE members, both online and face\-to\-face across the country during the public engagement events, has extended the geographical scope of the project and enriched its crowdsourced collection **\(S6\)**. In fact, it was through the training programme that further crowdsourced data was added to the digital archive **\(S5\)** and new courses on the history of Italian cinema were developed for the members of UNITRE, using CINERICORDI as learning material **\(S6\)**. 

 The project has also fostered an intergenerational collaboration through online learning and research. Through CINERICORDI, two generations of cinema\-goers have taken control of their shared cultural heritage. This collaboration has tackled the problem of digital exclusion of older people through the development of a digital platform in which they are both curators and users. In addition, the project has enabled interaction with younger people, who helped the older users to navigate digital contexts in two events organised by the team in Rome. These interactions have benefitted the participating students through key activities and events. For example, in collaboration with the Italian Ministry for Education and the Society for Italian Studies in the UK, CINERICORDI organised a national competition ‘ *Come Andavamo al Cinema*’ for high school students **\(R2b, ‘Competition’\)**. By encouraging students to engage with the content of the archive in creative ways, the aim of this competition was to promote inter\-generational collaboration and greater awareness of the history of cinema\-going. The winners of the first edition of the competition were the students of class III K, ISIS Alfonso Casanova from Naples. The students, together with their teacher Prof Luigi Barletta, presented the winning film at the award ceremony at the Experimental Center of Cinematography in Rome on April 27, 2017. 

 This competition allowed students to engage with the digital archive and use it to learn about a significant aspect of the history of Italian culture: cinema and its audiences. The tools developed in the project have also enabled students to use CINERICORDI as an educational resource, both in Italy and abroad. The educational impact has enhanced student’s understanding of post\-war Italian culture as well as demonstrably improving academic attainment through face\-to\-face and online intergenerational engagement. It has also provided new materials for use by teachers, as part of their syllabi. In an evaluation of the project, a teacher described the students’ enthusiasm: *“they guided their grandparents in the use of the digital archive”* and *“developed a sense of self\-esteem which helped reduce the gap in academic attainment”* **\(S7\)**. 

 The new knowledge generated by this research has contributed to a wider discussion over Italian film culture. Public engagement has occurred at national and international level, with events and across radio, TV, press and social media platforms, as well as our website \(both in English and in Italian\), which has attracted an international audience \(over 52,000 page views since January 2015\) **\(S10, see also S1, S8, S9\)**. This has enhanced public understanding of the historical culture of movie\-going in postwar Italy. 

 The project also had a variety of positive impacts on our partner, Memoro **\(S11\)**. Participating in the *Italian Cinema Audiences* project has enabled them to develop their international reach, leading them to develop collaborations with other international projects \(ECA and We HOPE with Lincoln University\). It also helped them to define the new technical standard for all their future video projects and create an app connecting Nvivo metadata \(research outputs\) to the videos. These will have long term benefits for the organisation. 

 In summary, the *Italian Cinema Audiences* project has: enabled older people’s participation in the creation of cultural heritage, while enhancing their wellbeing through reminiscence activities; rescued and preserved intangible cultural heritage for future generations; fostered intergenerational collaborations that have furthered younger people’s skills and understanding; and been pivotal for our project partner’s future development.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Jerri Daboo has created a programme of work based on her research into British South Asian culture and performance. Collaborating with renowned British South Asian musician Kuljit Bhamra and digital industrial designers Rogue Product, she has helped establish a new electronic form of the Indian tabla drum, a digital notation system to allow for composing and learning the tabla and other Indian drums, and a series of new teaching books for the tabla aimed at schools, music colleges, and professional musicians. Together, these innovations have addressed limitations in the teaching of tabla in educational settings in the UK, with the following impacts: 

-  transforming access to the tabla and pioneering cultural change and economic benefit through innovation, new economic products and the formation of a start\-up company, Keda Music Ltd. 

-  enabling new compositions and creating new performance opportunities for professional musicians and composers on the national stage \(e.g. new compositions by 750 young composers using the new tabla notation system\) 

-  increasing learning opportunities and enhancing cultural understanding in schools, colleges, and online 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Daboo’s research aims to examine and make visible the performance and cultural practices of British South Asian communities **\[3.1**, **3.2\]**. The tabla drums, and Indian music more generally, are usually taught orally as part of the *guru\-shishya parampara*, where a student affiliates with a *guru* or teacher, establishing a long\-term bond with them, often spiritual in nature. Daboo has been researching changes to this system in Britain as a result of the increasing South Asian diaspora communities and the desire of younger generations, as well as non\-Asians, to learn the forms. They tend to find the older system of learning with a *guru* hard to access or incompatible with their lifestyle. The resulting changes have also led to tensions within those communities between preservation of the original tradition and creating new approaches. This has led to a decline in the number of younger South Asians learning the tabla and Indian music, leading to a loss of their cultural heritage **\[3.3**, **3.4\]**. Daboo herself is a practitioner of forms of Indian classical dance and music, and so has had personal experience of these issues for many years, enriching her knowledge and research. 

 Daboo’s research began as part of Exeter’s AHRC\-funded British South Asian Theatre project \(2004\-2008\), through which she met renowned British South Asian musician Kuljit Bhamra, which led to a collaboration on the AHRC\-funded Southall Story project \(2011\-2014\), for which Daboo was PI. Building on Daboo’s research and Bhamra’s professional experience, along with Graham England and Phil Eddershaw of industrial designers Rogue Product, they created a new project \(led by Daboo and funded by AHRC/REACT\) on the tabla drums **\[3.5\]**. This resulted in the development of a new digital notation system, a series of teaching books, and a unique electronic version of the instrument utilising new technology, the Tabla Touch. 

 Daboo’s research and practice has enabled the facilitation and development of this programme as a practice\-based, engaged and collaborative research project focused on innovative approaches to playing, learning and notating for the tabla drums **\[3.3**, **3.4\]**. Her research into issues of traditional approaches to performance **\[3.1**, **3.2\]**, along with her experience of learning and performing Indian music and dance, resulted in her decision to lead focus groups with both Indian musicians and Western orchestral percussionists. These addressed the cultural and ethical aspects of the project, which is not designed to replace nor challenge the *guru\-shishya* system, but rather to enable greater accessibility and new potential for the instrument and music. The research outcomes from the focus groups fed into the co\-creation of the notation system and teaching books **\[5.1\]**, supported by Daboo through workshops and discussion sessions with musicians and teachers in London and Birmingham, as well as a testing of the books with the music hub services in Birmingham and Portsmouth. 

 Daboo’s research enabled a cultural and practice\-based dialogue between different community groups to allow for a range of approaches to be present at the same time in the outputs **\[3.4\]**, leading to impact for a wider range of students and audiences across generations and cultures. Daboo continues to conduct research and evaluation of the project, holding discussions and feedback sessions with musicians, performers and teachers, which feed into the continuing development and refinement of the electronic tabla, the notation system, and the teaching books. Bhamra states in the acknowledgement of the teaching books that without Daboo’s research and work, the books “would not exist” **\[5.3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Impact from Daboo’s research has led to changes in accessibility and knowledge of the tabla and Indian music more widely in education and professional contexts, as well as to new musical compositions, new employment opportunities for professional musicians and teachers, and new commercial products and economic benefit. The project was shortlisted for a *Times Higher Education* Award in 2017 for excellence and innovation in the arts, confirming the strength of this collaboration between academic research and public engagement and impact. 

###  Transforming access to the tabla and pioneering cultural change through innovation 

 The initial research project funded by AHRC/REACT resulted in the development of the prototype of the electronic tabla. This in turn led to the formation of a new commercial enterprise, Keda Music, to further develop the instrument and produce and market the teaching books and notation system **\[5.1, 5.2\].** Formed by Bhamra, along with design consultancy Rogue Product, Keda brought Daboo onboard as academic consultant. Not only has there been **economic benefit** for Keda through the creation of the **new commercial products**, but Keda confirmed they gained and benefitted from “ *new knowledge and expertise”* resulting from the “ *complex operation”* involving new technologies in the making of the tabla, and from expanding their work into the fields of music and education **\[5.3\]**. 

 The electronic tabla, named the Tabla Touch, was developed from the initial prototype created as part of the AHRC/REACT project and launched for sale in December 2020.It mimics the original instrument in a way not possible before with highly precise use of sensors placed on the drum\-pad heads and with extra functions such as automatic tuning and a sound bank of other percussion instruments. Keda was invited to present this innovative technology at the international conference *New Interfaces for Musical Expression \(NIME\)* in London in July 2020. Reviewers praised the **innovation** in opening up access to the instrument *: “In the same way that electronic keyboards have allowed many people to learn piano who would not otherwise have had access to an acoustic instrument, the electronic tabla has the potential to introduce students to the tabla in situations where access to acoustic ones is impractical”* **\[5.3\]**. Keda received UK and international orders for the Tabla Touch within the first week of sale. 

 The digital notation system has similarly led to **greater accessibility and new possibilities** for composing for and playing the tabla. Launched in London in 2017, it is part of Steinberg’s notation software, Dorico \(created by Daniel Spreadbury, developer of best\-selling music notation software, Sibelius\). Spreadbury endorses the new tabla notation system as making it “ *as easy as possible to create whatever kind of music you want to make.* \[…\] *We’re very proud to be working in partnership with \[Keda\].”* **\[5.4\]** 

###  By enabling the creation of pieces and ensemble performance not possible before, the notation system has resulted in a significant cultural change for both the instrument and Indian music. Renowned British composer Howard Goodall, who used it to compose for the tabla as part of an orchestra, described it as “pioneering” and “a game\-changer” \[5.5\]. He particularly praised the design of the new clef, which can be used for any Indian percussion instrument, and has predicted it to become as recognisable as treble and bass clefs. \[5.5\]. 

###  Enabling new compositions and creating new opportunities for performers 

 Composers had told Bhamra they wanted to write for the tabla, but that the lack of written notation in the Indian system made it difficult. The notation system, which is also a fundamental part of the new teaching books, now **enables composers and performers to learn how to play and write** for the instrument. Its development was supported by Sound and Music, a national organisation promoting new music, which runs a summer school at the Purcell School of Music for young composers, at which Bhamra teaches the notation system. As a result, **750 young composers** have written new pieces using the notation, as testified by Susanna Eastburn MBE, Chief Executive of Sound and Music **\[5.4\]**, who also commissioned three emerging composers to write new pieces for the tabla and a Western ensemble for the London launch, giving those young composers **increased visibility as well as economic benefit**. One of these composers, Laura Reid, received a further commission due to having tabla work on her CV. Commissioned by the Devon Philharmonic Orchestra and performed at the RAMM in Exeter in February 2020, Reid’s piece for tabla and string quartet demonstrates the new opportunities the notation has provided: *“I’m excited now to think that with all that work for me personally I’ve got some real building steps. \[…\] This project will enable \[the next\] one to happen, and then the next. The notation is good because it enables people to play together.”* **\[5.6\]** 

 This new ability to write for tabla as part of an ensemble has also enabled new compositions that include tabla for major theatre pieces, including *Bend It Like Beckham: The Musical* \(Howard Goodall, at the Phoenix Theatre, London, 2015\); *A Passage to India* \(Kuljit Bhamra, at the Park Theatre, London, 2018\); and *Twelfth Night* \(Magnus Mehta, at the Globe Theatre, London, 2017\). 

 Professional musicians have also benefited from the project. Western orchestral percussionists who wanted to learn the tabla, but had no direct access before, have learned to play via the notation and teaching systems, creating **new career opportunities**. An example is Joley Cragg, who was a percussion student at the Royal Academy of Music \(RAM\) when she attended the focus groups run by Daboo. She began to learn the tabla and notation system with Bhamra, which led to her composing and performing a piece for tabla for her final recital performance at the academy, the first time this had happened at the RAM. She was subsequently booked to play tabla in other orchestral contexts, giving her **increased career potential and economic benefit**. This included taking over the reins from Magnus Mehta in *Twelfth Night* at the Globe, a process transformed thanks to the new notation: *“It would have taken me hours to video Magnus playing, and sit and work out what he was doing.* \[…\] *That’s probably one of the biggest examples of how useful it’s been.”* **\[5.7\]** 

 With new music being written for tabla as a result of the project, Indian musicians also now have **increased opportunities** through learning the notation to perform in new contexts, for example, Indian tabla and dholak player Bindi Sagoo, who performed in the ensemble of *Bend It Like Beckham: The Musical*. Indian musician Hazel Correa explains that the notation means *“people \[can learn to\] play it with a very basic understanding of Western notation. It’s more accessible to everybody, which is really exciting.”* \[ **5.7**\] 

###  Increasing learning opportunities and enhancing cultural understanding 

 Bhamra has conducted tabla workshops in schools for 20 years, where teachers have often told him they have sets of the instrument but do not know how to teach them, or do not feel confident in approaching the ‘cultural aspects’. The teaching books and notation system are designed to address this by creating an accessible and clear approach to teaching and learning tabla and **enhancing knowledge** of Indian music more generally. This does not intend to replace the *guru\-shishya* system, but rather to offer an alternative approach that is accessible in new contexts. Daboo worked with Bhamra to develop the books through researching other systems of teaching drums, as well as how to integrate the cultural aspects in an engaging and sensitive way **\[5.2\]**. Launched at the Music and Drama Expo in London in 2017, the book series had sold 581 copies by 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020 in the UK, Europe, North America, and South Asia **\[5.3\]**. The books were trialled in the school music service hubs in Birmingham and Portsmouth. Bhamra held workshops with primary and secondary school teachers, creating long\-term resilience for the teaching method. Feedback from teachers, both South Asian and Western, shows the **educational benefit and cultural change** this has created: “ *Coming at it with some facility as percussionists but not in any knowledge of that oral tradition, that immediately is a key for us to unlock.”* \[Western music teacher in Birmingham, **5.8**\]; “ *it can be a scary instrument, but that can all be broken down as you’ve done. \[…\] I used to teach tabla in schools just for tabla, but now we’ve got wider opportunities.”* \[South Asian teacher in Birmingham, **5.8**\] 

 Harjit Singh, head of World Music and Percussion at Birmingham Music Services, explains that as well as opening up the instrument to Western practitioners, it also encourages young South Asians who do not want to do so under the *guru\-shishya* system to learn the tabla, thereby **reconnecting them with their cultural roots** *: “We’ve tried the method that’s always been there \[the guru system\] and it doesn’t work.* *\[This new system is\] an excellent foundation for the youngsters, because \[…\] with the old tradition some can’t relate to it, but this way everyone gets involved.”* **\[5.9\]** 

 In 2017, to enhance the educational benefit of the project, Daboo assisted Bhamra in creating two video series. *Demystifying Indian Music* and *Tabla Explorer* are available on the Keda website and YouTube and have together received over 17,000 views **\[5.10\]**. Commenters praise the “ *valuable and informative*” insight they deliver. A series of free downloadable music to play in ensembles in schools \(related to the teaching books\) is available on the Keda website **\[5.1\]**. The Keda YouTube channel has 1,260 subscribers, with 400 daily visits **\[5.3\]** \(as of 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020\). 

 As a direct result of the publication of the books, Bhamra was asked by music teachers to create a similar series using the notation system for the Indian dhol drum, which is very popular among Punjabi communities in Britain. The first of these was launched at the Music and Drama Expo in London in 2019, and Keda is currently developing an electronic form of the dhol based on their experience of the Tabla Touch, leading to **further accessibility and knowledge** of Indian drums, as well as to expanding Keda’s income streams. 

 Bhamra has demonstrated the Tabla Touch, as well as the new notation system and approach to learning and playing, with media appearances, including BBC Radio 3, BBC Asian Network, BBC One, ITV, and Channel 4, bringing the research, the tabla and Indian music in general to a **wider public audience**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 *Digital Delius* enhanced musical understanding by developing new interpretations of the work of Frederick Delius. The project collaborated with musicians, teachers, and the heritage sector, to create **new cultural artefacts**, influence **creative practice**, support **innovative teaching**, and stimulate **public engagement**. The research team built a digital exhibition for the British Library that made these sources freely available alongside expert commentary and innovative multimedia resources. *Digital Delius* reached hundreds of students, from primary school to undergraduate level, and engaged a wider audience through events, articles, and media appearances. Grimley worked closely with performers to increase knowledge and appreciation of the composer’s music, including world premiere recordings of hitherto unknown works. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research for this case study was Grimley’s AHRC\-funded project ‘Delius, Modernism, and the Sound of Place’, a collaboration between the University of Oxford, the British Library, and the Royal Library, Denmark. The British Library provided extended access to manuscripts and advice on cataloguing; the Royal Library provided expertise in specialist music programming software \(MerMEId\); and the research was undertaken by researchers based in the Faculty of Music and the e\-Research Centre at Oxford. Scholarly evaluation of Frederick Delius’s music has been slow to develop in comparison with other historically contemporary figures such as Mahler or Sibelius. In **\[R1\]**, Grimley showed that, far from being a rhapsodist with little feeling for musical form as his popular reception has assumed, Delius had a sophisticated relationship with key places \(Florida, Germany, Scandinavia, France\) and a keen sense for musical architecture. Detailed analyses of works in their cultural context revealed complex relationships between music, place and identity in Delius’s music, as in the case of the 1916 String Quartet, composed in English exile during the First World War **\[R4 and R5\]**. 

 Bullivant’s role in the project was the creation of the online Delius Catalogue of Works **\[R2\]** and curating the preparation of the Discovering Music Delius pages **\[R6\]**. Previous print\-based catalogues did not reflect the current state of manuscript sources, were difficult to use, and relatively inaccessible. The new digital catalogue was accessible to all, integrated with library and archival catalogues to reflect the current location of manuscripts, updateable, and easy\-to\-use thanks to the use of the music cataloguing software MerMEId **\[R3\]**. Bullivant’s research uncovered the problematic state of published sources of information on Delius performance. Manuscripts and printed scores of various Delius works held by the British Library and the Delius Trust reveal extensive editorial contributions, especially those of conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. These additions were incorporated wholesale into the Delius Collected Edition, rendering it impossible to distinguish between the composers’ annotations and those of Beecham and others. *Digital Delius* provided the opportunity to re\-assess and disseminate those resources, and to optimise their educative potential, allowing non\-specialists to gain a significantly richer and more enhanced understanding of the complex relationships between versions, manuscripts variants, and recordings in an online environment. The innovative quality of this research was recognised by a BL Labs Award in 2018 **\[A1\]**. A presentation based on an article drawn from the underpinning research and its findings won the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries Best Demonstration award for ‘MELD: A Linked Data Framework for Multimedia Access to Music Digital Libraries’ at the JCDL 2019 conference held in June at the University of Illinois Urbana\-Champaign, USA **\[A2\]**. The project won a Vice\-Chancellor's Public Engagement with Research Award at Oxford in 2019 **\[A3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 *Increased* *understanding of the relationship between manuscripts and the musical work* 

 *Digital Delius* enabled students, amateur and professional musicians, scholars and the public to have free access for the first time to a range of unique material, pairing digitized manuscripts with photographs, letters, concert programmes, recordings, published scores and expert commentary **\[A.i.–iii\]**. The British Library writes that ‘ *Digital Delius* played a crucial role in enabling the British Library to create its new online learning resource *Discovering music: early 20th century*’ and adds that ‘the success of *Discovering Music* has exceeded our expectations’: DM was set a target of 7,200 page views for its first year and achieved 3,293 in three weeks, with ‘Delius in Performance’ achieving 104 views in this period and 19,537 new users in the first 12 months with 26,104 logged **\[B.i\]**. A prototype article written by Bullivant with interactive features designed by Lewis allowed readers to access a glossary alongside video, audio, manuscript and typed content, and to view Beecham’s score of *Brigg Fair* and hear his recording of the work simultaneously **\[A.iv\]**. 

 *Influenced professional practice and understanding through co\-production of new cultural artefacts with musicians and directors* 

 Grimley’s edition of the original version of Delius’s String Quartet \(1916\) received its first performance in 99 years with the Villiers Quartet **\[C\]**. Reviews of the Villiers’ commercially released CD using Grimley’s edition **\[D\]** have been overwhelmingly positive, describing the original movements as ‘expertly reconstructed’ **\[E.i.–iii\]**. The Villiers Quartet state that ‘collaborating with \[Grimley and Bullivant\] was one of the most valuable things we have ever experienced as a string quartet’, and that ‘the information uncovered by Daniel Grimley and Joanna Bullivant has entered our collective DNA as a quartet … our approach to composers has also changed greatly since this project’ **\[B.ii\]**. Since release, Grimley’s edition of ‘Late Swallows’ has been the most streamed track from the CD, with 15,000 UK streams and a total of 186,000 globally since 2018 **\[B.iii\]**. Grimley subsequently worked with the Villiers on the premiere of two newly discovered movements from an earlier Quartet \(1888\), purchased at Sotheby’s by the Delius Trust with Grimley’s assistance as consultant, which received their world premiere performance in Oxford on 8 October 2020 at an event entitled *Discovering Delius* **\[F\]**. This performance took place during the Covid lockdown and was live\-streamed, accompanied by introductions and a Q&A session with Grimley and Bullivant: the link received over 1,500 views in its first month **\[B.iv\]**. 

 Grimley has collaborated with other groups and artists to co\-create new artefacts. George Parris, musical director of the Carice Singers, invited Grimley to work on a critically acclaimed recording of Delius’s choral music released in 2017, advising on repertoire and working with the singers before recording began. Parris writes that ‘I consider Daniel’s insights and suggestions of approaches to have been essential to \[the project’s\] success’ **\[B.v\]**. Grimley worked with the pianist Edward Rushton on the world premiere recording of six newly discovered piano pieces; Grimley edited the score and obtained funding from the Trust to publish the performance, which has been viewed 336 times since June 2020. Composer Colin Matthews describes the music on YouTube as ‘remarkable’ **\[G\]**. 

 *Supported young musicians to interpret Delius* 

 *Digital Delius* has supported younger musicians in a number of ways. A workshop with the Villiers Quartet aimed at amateur players and non\-specialist listeners was permanently captured in a video in *Discovering Music* **\[A.v\]**. The event also featured Page and Lewis’s prototype tablet app, which enabled live digital annotation and projection and enhanced engagement by allowing audience members to see score annotations rather than simply listen to discussion. 

 Grimley and Bullivant took part in an open rehearsal with the Oxfordshire County Youth Orchestra on 10 March 2018, conducted by John Traill. Students interviewed afterwards said they gained a ‘better picture of how Delius composes’ and said that they were now ‘Definitely thinking more about subtlety of affects and gestures, and how he tries to achieve that’ **\[H.i\]**. Traill writes that ‘the impact of this collaboration was wide and meaningful’, and that ‘the orchestra not only sounded better after this workshop, they also attained broader learning outcomes.’ He adds that ‘\[Grimley’s\] contributions to the concerts for schools \[on 27 January 2018\] helped articulate the *here and now* of the music that was being played, and further supported not only inspiring young people to pursue music, but also age\-appropriate school curriculum’ **\[B.vi\]**. 

 *Influenced innovative teaching* 

 Using collection items and articles from the *Discovering Music* Delius pages, the Head of Music at a comprehensive school in Surrey **\[B.vii\]**, prepared three sets of teaching resources, combining questions about context and interpretation with basic composition exercises. They are available as PDFs that can be downloaded and photocopied **\[A.vi\]**. Her pupils trialed the resources at the BL, where they viewed original manuscripts and worked with composer Anthony Payne, commenting that ‘It was interesting to find out that the composers do not think of all their pieces at once and write a piece from scratch it takes a long process of writing bits of music and see how they fit together \[sic\]’ and praising the different kinds of material available on *Discovering Music* **\[H.ii\]**. *Discovering Music* was used again for quiz activity with members of the public at ‘Humanities Light Night’ in Oxford in 2019, with numerous children commenting that they learned new things and would use the resource again **\[H.iii\]**. 

 Bullivant subsequently hosted an online workshop for teachers during the COVID\-19 lockdown on 5 June 2020. Attended by teachers from a diverse range of schools, including a South London Comprehensive and a state school in East Anglia, comments included: ‘students will find it super exciting\!’; ‘lots of lovely links with all the A level boards’; and ‘the PDF resources are brilliant’ **\[I\]**. Bullivant and Grimley are now developing materials for GCSE students based on feedback from the event. 

 *Increased understanding and knowledge through public engagement* 

 Numerous individuals have spoken of the transformative impact of the project on their understanding and knowledge. Conductor Lionel Friend has remarked that Grimley’s research ‘takes me to areas I have never before explored or even contemplated: most fascinating, most thought\-provoking and stimulating’ **\[B.viii\]**. Delius enthusiasts emailed Grimley to comment that his BBC Radio 3 broadcast on *Sea Drift* was ‘both measured and informative’ and directed them to new recordings **\[H.iv\]**. Grimley’s monograph was the subject of a Music Matters programme on Radio 3, first broadcast on 8 December 2018 and subsequently available on the BBC iPlayer **\[J\]** and Grimley has given pre\-concert talks \(for instance by the Park Lane Group\), which has informed critical understanding of Delius’s music and its context **\[E.iv\]**. Grimley has since provided expert advice to the Delius Trust, and has been appointed an official Adviser to the Trust from March 2020 **\[K.i\]**; he was elected honorary vice\-president of the Delius Society in May 2020 in recognition of his ‘reputation as an analyst, speaker and author on \[Delius’s\] music and its aesthetic and philosophical foundations’ **\[K.ii\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Exscientia, a spin\-out company of the University of Dundee created by Prof Andrew Hopkins FRSE, has grown into a market leader in artificial intelligence drug design technology. Since 2014, the company has attracted GBP84 million investment, earned revenue of GBP23.9 million, created 88 highly\-skilled jobs, and serviced 18 partnerships with major global Pharma and others \(GBP538 million in disclosed deals, with more undisclosed\). Exscientia has reduced the time and cost of pre\-clinical drug discovery and has delivered two novel drugs into first\-in\-human clinical trials, being the fastest AI\-design drug company to reach that critical stage. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The world has rarely been more acutely aware than it is now of the time and cost involved in the development of new drugs and vaccines. The pharmaceutical Industry is facing serious pressures, given estimates of a USD2.6 billion cost and 10\-15 year timeline for developing a new drug. Declining drug discovery R&D productivity is the most important challenge to address. One approach to tackle this problem is to harness chemical, pharmacological and biological data for automated drug design. **Prof Andrew Hopkins** has been at the forefront of this research by combining machine learning and big data analytics to tackle questions of target identification, polypharmacology and *de novo* compound design. 

 Hopkins is a pioneer of ‘network pharmacology’, coining the phrase in 2007 and expanding in a seminal 2008 review cited 1,324 times **\[R1\]**. Network pharmacology combines biological network analysis with chemical biology approaches, to design new drugs to perturb biological networks rather than individual targets. This is contrary to conventional drug discovery approaches based on highly specific targeting of a single protein that often lead to lower than desired clinical efficacy.  Network pharmacology is the concept that drugs for many diseases may require multiple activities to be most effective. This research by Hopkins opened up a new subfield in drug discovery **\[R1\]**. 

 The creation of ChEMBL in 2008, provided the first publicly\-available database of bioactive molecules including pharmacological and chemical structural\-activity relationship data that, significantly, was in a format amenable to reading by computers. Taking advantage of this resource, Hopkins embarked on a research project to harness the high\-quality chemoinformatics data and apply machine\-led learning to the process of new drug design. His team systematically integrated data derived from different disciplines including computational modelling **\[R2\]**, synthetic chemistry, biophysics **\[R3\]**, pharmacological testing and clinical studies, to develop methods and algorithms **\[R4, R5\]** to automate drug design. Hopkins collaborated with experimentalists at the University to efficiently design novel patentable chemicals for synthesis and then test the compounds designed by the algorithms **\[R2\]**. This resulted in creation of an automated, adaptive methodology for designing drug ligands to multi\-target profiles, with a 75% prediction success rate verified experimentally and the predicted target engagement confirmed *in vivo* **\[R2\-R6\]**. 

 It was quickly realised that the computational technology platform developed by the University of Dundee offered a highly scalable system to generate intellectual property **\[R5,R6\]**. Spin\-out Exscientia Ltd was created in 2012 as a technology platform company aiming to revolutionise productivity in drug discovery using data analytics and AI \(Artificial Intelligence\) techniques of machine learning during the initial phases from chemical design to production of a clinical candidate.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 a\) Raising multi\-million investment in, and revenue from, AI\-guided drug design 

 Exscientia has rapidly\-grown into a leading pharmatech company at the forefront of AI drug discovery. Since 2017, Exscientia has raised a total of GBP84 million, comprising: 

-  Series A EUR15 million in 2017 **\[E1\]** 

-  Series B USD26 million in 2019 **\[E2\]** 

-  Series C USD70 million in 2020 **\[E3\]** 

 \(including USD10 million raised after the announcement\). 

 Evotec, one of four investors, said of Series A in 2017: 

 “*Our investment in Exscientia represents Evotec’s single biggest equity placement to date and in, what we feel, is the world leading AI technology company*” **\[E1\]**. 

 Exscientia’s revenue rose from GBP1.5 million in 2018 to GBP9.8 million in 2020, with GBP23.0 million total revenue since 2016 **\[E4\]**. This enabled Exscientia to expand from its initial space in Dundee, to a second office in Oxford \(2017\), then into larger premises on the Oxford Science Park \(2018\). Recently \(2019/2020\), offices opened in Osaka \(Japan\) and Miami \(USA\). In the REF period, expansion increased the workforce from 3 to 91 staff **\[E4\]** by creating 88 highly\-skilled new jobs \(headcount: 88; FTEs: 88\) with staff numbers doubling each year for the past 3 years \(Figure\). 



  

 b\) Innovation and partnership with Pharma to accelerate drug discovery using AI 

 In addition to its own pipeline, Exscientia provides services to pharmaceutical companies where its automated AI drug design process can accelerate development of candidates for clinical trial. 

 These services have attracted 18 partnerships on 28 separate projects, developing drugs or technology for a range of diseases, including cancer, COVID\-19, psychiatric disease, bone disease, fibrosis and others **\[E4\]**.  Many collaborations are with global Pharma companies with revenue generated through initial upfront and research payments, near\-term and clinical milestone payments, and royalties on final products. Examples of such deals include: Bayer \(2019; EUR240 million\), Roche \(2019; CHF67 million\), Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb \(2019; USD25 million upfront, with undisclosed milestones\), GlaxoSmithKline \(2017; GBP33 million\), Sanofi \(2017, EUR250 million\), Sunovion \(2014; total USD4.8 million\) **\[E4\]**. Partnerships also exist with GT Apeiron, Evotec, SRI, RallyBio, Blue Oak, Huadong Medicine, IMI CARE, Diamond Light Source/Calibr, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, and the Gates Foundation **\[E4\]**. Twelve patents were filed or published on Exscientia molecules/methods in the REF period **\[E4\]**. 

 c\) Significant efficiency and cost savings compared to conventional drug discovery 

 Published industry benchmarks estimate it takes 4.5 years and USD63 million to get to pre\-clinical testing of a drug candidate. In 2014, Exscientia signed a partnership with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Ltd and one year later delivered a molecule meeting Sumitomo criteria **\[E5\]**. Fewer than 400 compounds needed to be synthesized to identify the final compound using Exscientia’s automated system, saving over 80% costs in these drug discovery stages, or 30% of the total drug development cost **\[E4, E6\]**. The Director of Sumitomo’s chemistry team said: 

 “*Working with Exscientia has been transformative, enabling us to progress projects far faster than had previously been possible*”, and their Director of Drug Development added, “... *projects by ex scientia are providing exciting productivity and efficiency gains…”* **\[E5\]**. 

 In 2019, Exscientia provided GlaxoSmithKline with a first selective, potent *in vivo*, lead molecule, discovered in 5 iterative cycles with only 85 compounds tested **\[E7\]** in comparison with industry benchmarks of 2,500 per project. Also in 2019, Sanofi exercised its option to advance a compound from their 2017 partnership where Exscientia designed bispecific\-binding molecules after triaging >1,000 disease\-relevant target combinations and designing nearly 100 billion novel compounds. The first\-in\-class bispecific molecule being progressed by Sanofi interacts with two drug targets related to inflammation and fibrosis \- normally needing two separate drugs **\[E8\]**. 

 These achievements highlight the efficiency and productivity gains made possible through Exscientia’s algorithms. Their current pipeline has 12 drug discovery projects **\[E4\],** and 5 new drug candidates have been delivered in under 14 months, far quicker than the 4.5 to 5\-year industry benchmark and with associated cost savings **\[E7\]**. Evotec confirm: 

 “*Through our partnership with Exscientia we have seen first\-hand evidence that they can deliver the most productive drug discovery engine in the industry*” **\[E2\]**. 

 **d\) Fastest AI\-designed drugs to accelerated IP filing and first\-in\-human clinical trials** 

 Exscientia has been the fastest AI\-design drug developer in the world to reach the clinic, enabling accelerated IP filing. In January 2020, though partnership with Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Ltd, Exscientia delivered into Phase 1 clinical trials the first AI\-designed drug ever to be tested in humans **\[E9\].** The drug, in trial in Japan, treats patients with obsessive\-compulsive disorder, enabling Sumitomo to expand its pipeline to treat key unmet needs in psychiatry/neurology. Sumitomo’s Senior Executive Officer said: 

 “*We are very excited with the results of the joint research that resulted in the development of candidate compounds in a very short time…*” **\[E9\]**. 

 An Exscientia\-proprietary AI\-designed drug targeting cancer is also in Phase I first\-in\-human clinical trial, enrolling its first participant in December 2020 **\[E9\]**. Exscientia and Hopkins have received numerous accolades \(collated in **E10**\) and their leading position in the sector is confirmed by many: 

 GSK say “ *Exscientia has… proven innovation in drug discovery technologies…their industry\-leading approach will accelerate the discovery of new molecules”* **\[E4\]**; 

 Forbes list Exscientia as a “ *leading AI drug discovery* *startup*” for possible acquisition by Big Pharma for over USD2 billion in the near future **\[E10\]**; 

 Evotec say “\[Exscientia’s\] *AI approaches…can positively and radically impact drug discovery”* **\[E1\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Scientific innovation is linked to technological breakthroughs. Recognising that standard commercially available equipment was unable to deliver the scientific objectives of current and future research programmes, the Astrophysics Research Centre \(ARC\) at QUB teamed\-up with Oxford Instruments’ Andor Technology to develop the Balor imaging sensor and synchronisation platform. The impact is two\-fold. First, this partnership has allowed Andor to expand into the large\-format detector market and increased their revenue by more than GBP3,000,000 since September 2019 alone. Second, striking Balor\-enabled solar images have generated significant press and industry coverage, engaging new audiences in Solar science and helping to accelerate Andor’s leading position in the global scientific camera market. 

  
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Prof. Mathioudakis and Prof. Keenan work in the Astrophysics Research Centre \(ARC\) in Queen’s University Belfast \(QUB\). They performed the underpinning research that both revealed the need for new large\-format, high\-cadence scientific CMOS \(complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor\) devices and guided their development. Prof. Mathioudakis was the academic lead on the collaboration with Andor. 

 Studies of the Sun and its outer atmosphere have always been the source of notable physical insights. From the discovery of helium, first made in the solar atmosphere, to the identification of nuclear fusion as a power source for stars and the unexpected physics of neutrinos, our nearest star is a unique source for our understanding of the Universe in its many forms. The Sun is the most important astronomical object for humankind, with solar activity driving space weather and having profound effects on climate and communications. Its atmosphere and interior provide a working example where structures and dynamics can be studied over an enormous range of spatial \(100km – 100,000km\) and temporal \(seconds to months\) scales. The Sun provides a vantage reference point where the complex interplay between the plasma and the magnetic field is visible and can be studied continuously at unprecedented detail. 

 Research in ARC has proved the existence of Alfvén waves in the lower solar atmosphere **\[R1\]** and discovered the smallest magnetic flux cancellations in the photosphere **\[R2\]**. Alfvén  waves and magnetic flux cancellations are key to understanding the structure and dynamics of the Sun’s outer atmosphere. First, spectropolarimetric data was inverted to obtain the magnetic energy dissipated and it was compared to the radiative losses **\[R3\]**. Next spectral imaging was used, alongside radiative hydrodynamic models to disentangle the physical processes in rapidly evolving events and solar flares **\[R4, R5\].** This established strong evidence for ubiquitous compressive waves in the Sun's chromosphere **\[R6\]**. This research, however, has also emphasised the need to push the limits of solar instrumentation, and highlighted the requirement for a new generation of large format, high\-speed camera equipment. 

 As a result of their research pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible with existing instrumentation, QUB researchers have played a central role in defining the science specifications for the next generation of solar telescopes, such as the US\-led Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope \(DKIST\) and the European Solar Telescope \(EST\). These are unique facilities that will revolutionise the field. Key advances that will be offered by these instruments are ultra\-high spatial \(25km\) and temporal \(millisecond, ms\) resolution, photospheric and chromospheric imaging spectroscopy, vector magnetometry, plus infrared coronal magnetometry. Prof. Mathioudakis is a member of the DKIST instrumentation team, a board member of the European Association of Solar Telescopes, and a member of the EST Science Advisory Group. The requirement for large format, high cadence detectors became apparent. 

 Profs. Mathioudakis and Keenan have partnered with Andor Technology to realise this vision and develop the detectors for these telescopes. This project was funded by an STFC grant for GBP1,900,000 to QUB in January 2015 \(PI: Mathioudakis\) and H2020 grants of GBP50,000 in June 2015 and October 2016 \(PI: Mathioudakis\). This research resulted in QUB leading the development and supply of all the optical cameras that equip the US DKIST telescope. The resulting product, named Balor, has been taken to market by Andor. Balor is the largest\-format, high\-cadence scientific Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor camera commercially available. This development will allow Oxford Instruments/Andor to maintain a leading position in the high\-tech market. It opens new technological markets and also provides growth and diversity in existing markets.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Andor Technology \(now within Oxford Instruments\) is a spin\-out company from QUB. Over the past 12 years, researchers from ARC in QUB have worked closely with Andor on the development of several scientific cameras and instruments for astronomical applications. This partnership involved the specification, testing and evaluation of both hardware and software to achieve microsecond\-accuracy synchronisation across several camera platforms. This improved Andor’s understanding on a number of technical issues allowing novel solutions to be applied to camera products such as the Neo, Zyla and Marana of the sCMOS range and four models of the iXon EMCCDs. This success helped Andor gain a leading position in the scientific camera market on a global scale, particularly in the growing area of astronomy. 

 However, as outlined above, the demands of research have outstripped the capabilities of these detectors. This created the need for innovative technological breakthroughs to enable the next generation of scientific investigations of the Sun. In order for Andor to maintain and grow its current global lead, it must match the pace of development. This is only possible by working closely with frontline researchers that are leading the charge into new scientific territory. 

 “*Balor was initiated through the solar physics research programmes undertaken at Queen’s University Belfast, and developed in collaboration with staff in the Queen’s Astrophysics Research Centre, University College London, Armagh Observatory, Northumbria University, University of Glasgow, University of Sheffield, University of St Andrews, University of Warwick and the US National Solar Observatory, from funding provided by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, part of UK Research and Innovation*” **\[S1\].** 

 By partnering with QUB for this project, Andor gained access to numerous research groups in the UK, allowing them to develop a good understanding of the market\-place \(as a company it would only make sense to pursue a project with a sustainable user base\). As outlined by Dr. Colin Coates, Head of Product Management for Physical Sciences and OEM at Andor, this research\-led approach has generated an international success story: 

 “*Balor was formally launched in Sept 2019 and to date we have sold almost 30 units across a range of countries, including USA, UK, China, Korea, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden, amounting to > £3m revenue*.” **\[S2\].** 

 This new breed of large\-format, high\-cadence cameras **\[S3\]** has also been deployed on the DKIST. DKIST is a USD400,000,000 facility, constructed by the National Solar Observatory in Hawaii, USA. It operates in the optical and near\-infrared wavelength ranges and will be the pre\-eminent ground\-based solar telescope for the foreseeable future. DKIST has 4 main instruments that will operate in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and QUB led a consortium of 8 UK universities and Andor to deliver the detector equipment for all 4 instruments in the visible. QUB’s lead role in this was highlighted in the STFC Innovations Club newsletter in 2015 **\[S4\]**.  For DKIST to meet its scientific objectives the cameras had to cover a large field\-of\-view at the diffraction\-limited resolution of the telescope and at very high temporal resolution. The specific scientific objectives require large\-format \(16,000,000 pixels\), highly sensitive cameras obtaining approximately 60 high\-fidelity images of the Sun every second. The leading role of QUB in the development of Balor and its relevance to DKIST is outlined by the Head of Product Management for Physical Sciences and OEM at Andor **\[S3\]**: 

 *“The joint UK funding initiative spearheaded by QUB, through which the UK designed and supplied Balor detectors to the new DKIST solar telescope in the USA, provided the necessary commercial and financial stimulus to support a challenging and innovative technology development that opens up new scientific possibilities across astronomy and beyond. Furthermore, QUB Astrophysics offered invaluable technical and usage expertise that proved critical at various stages of development and as well as taking a leading role in both alpha and beta testing.”* 

 As Richard Morgan reports for the BBC *“Experts have said it will enable a new era of solar science.”* **\[S5\].** The telescope came online in mid\-2019 and, through the QUB\-driven Balor system produced stunning images of the Sun in late 2019 \(Fig 1\) **\[S6\].** 



 **Fig 1. \[S6\]** *“The highest resolution Solar images have been captured by Andor Balor sCMOS cameras at the largest solar telescope in the world”* \(Note Texas to scale\) “ *The images were taken with the newly released 16\-megapixel Andor Balor sCMOS camera, which was developed as part of the telescope project which involves a research consortium with key driving from **Queen’s University Belfast**”* **\[S7\].** Image credit NSO/AURA/NSF. 

 The impact generated by this was immediate. The ability to relate the size of features on the Solar surface to the size of states in the US captured the public’s imagination, with popular science articles appearing in newspapers with a huge circulation such as the **New York Times**: 

#  “*These images show the Sun’s surface in greater detail than ever before. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope released the highest resolution observations of the sun’s surface ever taken. These cell\-like structures — each about the size of Texas — are the signature of violent motions that transport heat from the inside of the Sun to its surface”* \[ **S8**\]. 

 From a broader impact perspective, it is important to note that a movie of the data in Fig. 1 is available in **\[S5\]** and **\[S8\]**. The ability to make videos of solar dynamics not only allows researchers to study the Sun in real time but provides a crucial new modality for educating and inspiring the general public about the work that is performed in our universities. This is made possible by the ability of each camera to generate approximately 2.5 Gbytes of data per second. This capability has revolutionised the use of large\-area sCMOS cameras for the acquisition of scientific data. This was driven directly by the need to obtain high resolution spectropolarimetric data in real time \(a requirement revealed in **R1** to **R6** above\) and its development and testing were performed by QUB researchers. 

 In addition, it is crucial to acknowledge the impact of this ability to reach into mainstream media for Andor Technology’s strategy to accelerate their growth in international markets. 

 The solar astronomy market alone is substantial, given the continued investment in existing solar facilities in Europe, US, India and China. A significant part of this market is migrating towards the next generation of sCMOS detectors which offer faster speeds and lower noise. Non\-solar applications include: near\-Earth object detection, speckle interferometry, lucky imaging and other projects related to high\-time resolution astrophysics. It is important to recognise that the unit volume of the large area sCMOS market size will not be as high as that of the current breed of mid\-range sCMOS cameras developed for microscopy and optical electron microscope instrumentation applications. However, the large\-area astronomy detectors are typically priced significantly higher than mid\-range detectors \(in excess of GBP100,000 per unit\), so a lower\-volume market yields an appropriate business case. In the longer term, it will be worthwhile adapting the camera platform for high\-speed X\-ray detection applications, including protein crystallography and computed 3D X\-ray tomography. Andor introduced the Balor camera to the market in September 2019 and has sold units to 7 different countries, generating a revenue of over GBP3,000,000 for the company. Their target is for the Balor platform “ *to contribute over £7 million per annum to Andor’s revenue and the UK economy within the next 3 years*” \[ **S2**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Mathematical Anxiety is a debilitating tension and worry that besets many children, students and adults. Sufferers will try to avoid any kind of mathematical activity and choose careers where mathematical skills are not required. By developing methods that teach mathematics experientially, assisting reflection and fostering ‘mathematical resilience,’ Penazzi has led a change in maths teaching in Benin. This has positively affected student attainment and the perception of maths by both students and teachers. In a three\-day residential course in UK Higher Education Penazzi’s experiential teaching techniques increased the attainment of students by more than one\-degree classification and in Benin it is changing the way mathematics is taught. As a consequence, teachers report lower levels of anxiety amongst students who now perform better, understand and engage with the subject and gain improved results. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As an active researcher in model theory and in the topological dynamics of algebraic groups \[1, 2\], Penazzi enjoyed the challenge of discovering novel truths and exploring uncharted mathematical territory. Passion for mathematics shaped Penazzi’s learning, but, when looking at his students, he noticed that, for most of them, their motivation did not arise from any pleasure in learning or the challenge of the mathematical problems. He identified that the majority of students saw mathematics as a passive process, mostly memorizing formulae and routines and then being able to replicate them in exams.  A lack of any deeper understanding of the subject creates challenges when students tackle increasingly complex or applied mathematical problems.  Many students showed signs of tension, apprehension and fear that has been identified with Mathematical Anxiety. This anxiety does not mean that students are necessarily bad at maths, rather that the thought of solving mathematical problems generates the anxiety. Teachers may also experience Mathematical Anxiety and this can affect the way that they teach the subject.  However, the experience of working mathematicians is profoundly different to that of teachers or students suffering from Mathematical Anxiety. Penazzi’s research investigates the causes of Mathematical Anxiety and has developed solutions that address the issue. 

 There has been a documented steady decline in the basic mathematical skills of students starting a STEM university degree across the world. This decline has been noted by a number of international research studies and the European Society for Engineering Education’s report *Mathematics for the European Engineer* in 2002 commented that the decline was ‘common in the Western world.’ The effect of disengagement is felt in relatively low numbers of students worldwide choosing mathematics\-heavy routes in high school and mathematics degrees in HE. Consequently, there is a lack of a STEM\-knowledgeable workforce globally. The 2017 UK Government commons select committee report *Industrial Strategy: science and STEM skills,* states under section 3 ‘Closing the STEM skills gap’: ‘Nearly 40% of UK employers report difficulties recruiting staff with relevant STEM skills.’ 

 Mathematical Anxiety does not just encompass cognitive numeracy skills, such as content knowledge and application. It is also experienced in the affective sphere, affecting our emotional capacity to apply ourselves to any given task. What is missing therefore is mathematical resilience, a combination of cognitive and affective skills that equip students with the desire to value the subject. This helps provide the tenacity to struggle with the learning required and the ability to find the resources needed to help understanding. Students with Mathematical Anxiety lack an optimistic outlook on the subject that would support creative mathematical problem solving. Penazzi’s research in Benin has identified that, pedagogically, maths was very orderly, but rule\-bound, with students disengaged and unable to explore problems creatively. 

 To address the problem of Mathematical Anxiety Penazzi collaborated with Senior Coach Jo McCready and Frontier Education outdoor course director Sharon Rosser. They redesigned an existing outdoor provision and created involving challenges that would make learning mathematics enjoyable \[3\]. The pleasure derived from mathematics comes from the satisfaction of successful problem solving and exploration of new ideas. Outdoor learning presented a similar positive experience and by incorporating mathematical problems into these activities, Penazzi developed a powerful tool to engage previously disengaged students. The collaboration led to the development of a theory of the blended use of experiential learning and coaching techniques to support the learning of mathematics. This approach was called Promoting Engagement in Mathematics Experientially \(PEME\). The course makes students experience some of the new demands of higher education, in particular, making them reflect on how they can best approach their problems. These may be difficulties in understanding, how they can organize themselves efficiently, and how small but incremental triumphs provide a sense of achievement and the self\-confidence to address stubborn problems. 

  

 The three\-day residential course, ‘Frontier Education Mathematics’, developed simple non\-mathematical team activities that simulated mathematical processes. These activities developed teamwork, critical thinking, precision and communication skills. The exercises created an unencumbered experience, inspiring creative problem\-solving, fortitude and the resilience required for the dedicated study of mathematics. This circumvented the ingrained perception of mathematics as a potentially worrisome memory exercise. Facilitation sessions and reflective discussions after the activities helped students move away from their past learning experiences and engage more actively with their degree studies \[3\]. 

 As a shorter alternative, Penazzi developed a condensed version of the program for Welcome Weeks in HE \[4\] and in schools \[5\]. A version of the PEME approach was also developed for teachers to address Mathematical Anxiety both in themselves as learners and as educators teaching it to others. These short activities are called EMAs \- Experiential Mathematical Activities. Penazzi presented and tested them in schools and developed a programme of training for teachers on how to create, deliver and facilitate these short ‘EMA’ sessions. 

  

 EMAs can be adapted to any school level and are based on a ‘threshold concept’ which opens up a new and previously inaccessible way of thinking. These short Experiential Mathematical Activities combat Mathematical Anxiety by creating memorable moments, having real\-life applications or by creating identification with a student’s experience. 

 One fundamental aspect of the whole process, which makes it unique as a mathematical intervention, is the dedicated facilitation session after the activities. This reflection helps to further motivate the students when they revisit their experience and find a personal relevance that resonates with their own interests \[6\].

This has led to a change in maths teaching in Benin, benefitting student attainment and improving the perception of maths. In the UK, Penazzi ran a three\-day experiential residential course called Frontier Education Mathematics. It consisted of outdoor activities involving problem solving processes and the formulation of questions and strategies that are analogous to mathematical study. In the pre\- and post\-activity interaction, participants review and transfer their learning to the context of their maths course and their own future employment. After the course, one lecturer commented: “ **There is a noticeable difference before and after the residential course”**, and that they were **“more lively.”** Furthermore, **“In a workshop environment, the students can reinforce their learning when discussing their tasks, and helping each other out. For this purpose, the attained friendships and more active “class\-life” is definitely beneficial.”** \[A\] 

 Penazzi led a research trip to Benin in June 2018 that included four University of Central Lancashire students involved in his research and work in schools. Penazzi made contact with a local Non\-Governmental Organisation \(NGO\) called Servime, which supports African countries and Benin in particular to help reduce skills loss through emigration. A partnership was created with Servime and four primary schools to support the engagement of pupils with mathematics \[B\]. 

 In Beninese education, pupils attend the Ecole Primaire at 6 years old, equivalent to KS1 & 2, followed by 3 years in College\-1, equivalent to KS3, and 3 years in College\-2, equivalent to KS4, before entering University. For College\-2 they choose between four strands or ‘Series’, of which only one \(Serie C\) has a strong mathematical content and leads to university courses in Mathematics, Physics or Engineering. Currently only around 5% of students choose Serie C, compared to the 20% that the Benin government identifies as needed for national development. In particular, the Government has identified the need for a more widespread and equal access to technical and mathematical\-based courses. The focus is to create a critical mass of trained teachers who can deliver the specific pedagogical support required to increase student access to Serie C. The years in Primary school and College\-1 are pivotal in the formation of the students’ approach towards Mathematics. Addressing Mathematical Anxiety at this stage will help to equip more students with the confidence and skills needed to choose Serie C and then go on to study STEM courses at university. These activities address specific Objective 3 from the Benin Education Sector Plan Post 2015 which has the aim to provide children aged 3\-15 access to a quality basic education \[C\]. 

 <ins> **Enhancing mathematics teaching in Benin through experiential mathematical activity**</ins> 

 Penazzi and his students visited schools in Natitingou and neighbouring villages in the Atakora Department to form a discussion group to identify the strengths and weaknesses of Beninese teaching strategies. The teaching methods observed were extremely methodical, with students working rigidly within taught parameters without being given the personal space to explore problems. This regimented, disciplinary approach was discovered to be a cause of disengagement with Mathematics \[J\]. Teachers in Benin, like their counterparts in the UK, also reported experiencing Mathematical Anxiety and this was highlighted in their feedback \[E1\].  **“A lot of teachers also didn’t like mathematics, so we had a preconceived idea, mathematics is hard, it’s hard, kids don’t work when we didn’t know how to teach \[mathematics\]”** Leon Mpo, Principal, EPP SOS Enfants \[E2\]. 

 Penazzi and Servime agreed a plan with the local Beninese authorities \[D\], for a year\-long pilot project with four primary schools in different settings which began in 2019. During the pilot study Penazzi trained 20 primary teachers from the four schools, which served approximately 280 pupils, on delivering Experiential Mathematical Activities \[I\].  A resource hub was created, operated by Servime, where teachers met and co\-created six Experiential Mathematical Activities tailored to the Beninese curriculum.  These new teaching materials were then delivered in all four schools. 

 The feedback from teachers was very positive, highlighting a general increase in their confidence in teaching mathematics: **“I used to have difficulty explaining certain mathematical concepts, but with the experiential mathematics it is easier to approach the topics”** \[E1\] **“With the course given by Davide Penazzi I understood that I can go via simple games to then get to satisfying results and this \[made me overcome\] the mathematical anxiety”** \[E1\]. 

 Teachers made changes in how they presented their material, using Penazzi’s strategy to teach the concepts of mathematics \[E2\]. **“…we have understood the importance of bringing the students to apply to reality the formulas they learn”** \[E4\]. Consequently **, “experiential mathematics have changed the pupils’ attitudes towards maths”** and **“They are drawn towards mathematics much more because they have found an interest in it”** \[E1\]. A teaching pathway was formed starting from the outdoor applied, experiential mathematics and ending with the abstraction of manipulating figures and numbers in the classroom: **“The training in the methods has made my teaching easier. This training has enabled me to go from concrete to abstract mathematical ideas.”** The impact of the training was to change their pupils’ attitudes towards maths. **“They like the sessions much more and they are thriving.”** Significantly, teachers reported better scores: **“experiential maths activities have had a significant effect on the pupils’ results.”** **“The students’ results have really improved.”** Teaching is easier too: **“teaching is much easier now due to the experiences we’re able to give in order to pass on the knowledge”** \[E1\]. 

 These projects are addressing Benin National Specific objective 3, and thus UN Sustainable Development Goal 4: ‘Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.’ Furthermore, with an increased number of students in STEM subjects, they are addressing Goals 8 ‘sustainable economic growth’ and Goal 9, ‘sustainable industrialization and \[the fostering of\] innovation’. Kevidjo Idoho, Head of the Natitingou\-Toucountouna Teaching region and representative coordinator of the Ministry of Maternal and Primary Education said: **“…above all the impact is to bring a little more to the clarification of the teachings of mathematics, to the learning of mathematics by our learners and \[…\] I think it is a good thing that children can learn mathematics more easily. The fear they have about teaching, the learning of mathematics, is dispelled by the approaches you implement.”** \[F\] 

 <ins> **Experiential Mathematical Activities in the UK**</ins> 

 The first application of the project in the UK was the development of the three\-day residential course to support transition to HE Mathematics, called Frontier Education Mathematics. This course has run with the first year BSc Mathematics and MMath at University of Central Lancashire since 2016. The positive effects of this intervention have been studied across four years.  Students who attended the Frontier Education course have gained a 14 grade higher average percentage at the end of their first year compared to students who did not attend the course \[K\]. 

 Penazzi has developed and delivered experiential learning activities in UK schools, along with CPD sessions for 20 primary and secondary school teachers. All attending teachers reported that they found the training useful. Thematic analysis shows that they will start implementing Experiential Mathematical Activities \(EMAs\) in their practice.  The teachers stated they would use the problem\-solving activities and games to elicit greater interest in maths. They also comment on changing their delivery method, embedding models that will engage with the affective sphere of the students: **“\[The\] comfort zone model will be in my mind when thinking about more able \[students\]”** says one *.* **“\[I will spend\] more time on anxiety in maths and how it can be addressed”** *,* says another. They will also share their knowledge with their colleagues to create good practice: **“\[I will\] encourage others in my school regarding \[the\] 'learning pit' and growth mind set.”** Whilst another colleague comments that they will **: “Develop support staff approaches in school”.** \[H\] 

 <ins> **The effects of Covid\-19**</ins> 

 The original plan involved a visit to the four schools in Benin in May 2020 to obtain further evidence. Due to travel restrictions, it was not possible to make that visit. Some of the evidence was obtained remotely but several items of evidence collection were not possible. We were unable to meet with pupil focus groups to hear about the effects of the pilot project on their perceptions and their engagement with mathematics. Similarly, we were unable to meet with teacher’s focus groups to discuss the effect of the pilot project on their perception of mathematics. We also wanted to create a working group to share experiences of delivering the developed activities and writing activities for the production of a booklet. Furthermore, we were going to meet with governmental bodies with the aim of securing a continuation of the project. Some interviews have been done but plans for further work have been paused for a year awaiting the pandemic to subside.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Public sector bodies need effective methods to evaluate long\-term returns on spending in areas such as environmental protection. National and international bodies have used Professor Mark Freeman’s research on intergenerational social discount rates \(SDRs\) to underpin their valuation of long\-term assets. The methods and recommendations arising from this work have been adopted by HM Treasury in its *Green Book* instructions to all UK government departments; by the Dutch government’s *Green Book* equivalent; by the UK’s Office for National Statistics for valuation of long\-term assets in the national accounts; and by the New York State Government’s Department of Environmental Conservation for estimating the value of reducing carbon and other greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions. Freeman’s work has also been widely cited in policy documents of governments and national and international agencies. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 HM Treasury’s *Green Book* notes that “society as a whole... prefers to receive goods and services sooner rather than later”. This is why a government will place a lower value on a future benefit for each year that it expects to wait to receive it. 

 Social discount rates \(SDRs\) quantify the magnitude of this effect. Because of the compounding effects of interest, the economic values that governments place today on long\-term projects are extremely sensitive to the precise choice of SDR. For example, if the SDR is 1% then a government will place a value of GBP60.80 today on a project that will deliver GBP100 of benefits in 50 years’ time \(calculated as 100/1.01<sup>50</sup>\); yet if the SDR increases only slightly, to 3%, the value placed today on the same project is much lower, at GBP22.81 \(calculated as 100/1.03<sup>50</sup>\). 

 This sensitivity of valuation to the choice of SDR is of significant concern to governmental bodies, because many of the pressing problems facing society today – including climate\-change mitigation – have very long\-term consequences. For these reasons, determining the intergenerational SDR has been described as “one of the most critical problems in all of economics” \(Weitzman, 2001\). 

 One of the two broad approaches to determining the SDR, the ‘positivist’ method, states that it should reflect rates of return offered by other investments, particularly government bonds. This approach requires an understanding of asset pricing theory, and it is primarily from this financial angle that Freeman has contributed to the literature in his research conducted at Loughborough. Freeman works with co\-authors – most notably Groom \(LSE/Exeter\) – who mainly specialise in the alternative ‘normative’ approach, which states that the SDR should be determined by considering more philosophically the ethics of intergenerational equity. 

 The ‘term structure’ of SDRs plots the relationship between the SDR and the maturity of the project being appraised. The Freeman/Groom team has contributed extensively to the ‘declining discount rates’ \(DDRs\) literature, which argues that this term structure should be downward\-sloping, with lower discount rates applied to longer\-lived assets. 

 The team’s econometric estimation of the real interest rate process, with particular emphasis on the inflation component, constructed a new positivist declining term structure of SDRs. Previous research had mixed real \(inflation\-adjusted\) and nominal data, and this work was the first to resolve this inconsistency **\[R1\]**. 

 Further research across a number of different theoretical frameworks proved that in practice it is essentially impossible to empirically estimate with precision the rate at which the term structure of SDRs should decline. This work established the hypersensitivity of intergenerational SDRs to small changes in econometric assumptions **\[R2\]**. Freeman also applied DDRs for the first time in a full\-cost accounting framework to the valuation of environmental assets **\[R3\]**. 

 In addition, Freeman co\-authored what is primarily a review paper on DDRs, with a clear focus on potential policy applications **\[R4\]**. The paper formed part of one of the very few 2014 American Economic Association conference sessions to be webcast and then placed on the AEA website; the session was chaired by Lord Stern and discussed by Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow. 

 Freeman’s research at Loughborough also resulted in a 2018 *American Economic Journal: Economic Policy* article that is extensively used as the go\-to survey of expert opinion on intergenerational SDRs **\[R5\]**. As well as describing the range of views held by experts, the article provides a conceptual understanding of why there is such strong disagreement on this issue. Reconciling differences in expert opinions into ‘consensus’ SDRs, Freeman’s work has also shown that the speed with which the term structure declines depends crucially on whether experts are taking a positive or normative position on social discounting **\[R6\]** – providing a key critique of one of the main papers in this field.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Freeman’s research on long\-term discount rates applicable to environmental and other policies has been cited in documents produced by governmental and other agencies around the world between 2014 and 2020. This is due partly to his participation in conferences with policymakers and to reports based on research that he has authored or co\-authored for national and international organisations **\[S1\]**. 

 In the US Freeman’s work has contributed to a report by the prestigious National Academies of Science, Engineering & Medicine, a Council of Economic Advisers briefing to the Obama Administration and an Institute of Policy Integrity report on emissions standards. His research has also been cited in economic and environmental policy documents of the German, Irish, New Zealand and Rwandan governments, by the European Commission and by the OECD. Freeman presented twice in 2016 to the Home Office Contest counter\-terrorism team on the cost\-benefit case for long\-term de\-radicalisation programmes. The Home Office Head of Counter\-Terrorism Strategy and Performance later stated: “The points you made about different approaches to cost\-benefit analysis and counter\-terrorism helped us with our own thinking on the matter.” **\[S1\]** 

 As well as this reach, full details of which can be accessed via the links listed in **S1**, the significance of the impact of Freeman’s work is demonstrated by the examples below. 

  

 *• **Setting of the discount rates used in cost\-benefit analysis methods prescribed by the UK Treasury’s Green Book in 2018 and 2020** 

 In 2018 HM Treasury reissued its *Green Book*, the guidance that covers a huge range and volume of public sector investment decisions and prioritisation. The guidance “applies to all proposals that concern public spending, taxation, changes to regulations and changes to the use of existing public assets and resources... \[and\] all government departments, arm’s\-length public bodies with responsibility derived from central government for public funds and regulatory authorities” \(2018 *Green Book* foreword\). As part of the update, HM Treasury undertook a detailed review of whether the discount rates used in the previous edition remained appropriate, including its use of DDRs. 

 Following two workshops with HM Treasury, Freeman, with Groom and Spackman, authored a detailed report on this topic **\[S2\]**. This was the only academic supplementary guidance to the *Green Book* published online by HM Treasury. It cited and used all the underpinning research except R3, and provided the academic support to the discounting recommendations given in the *Green Book*. In 2020 the lead author of the *Green Book* at HM Treasury stated: “Mark Freeman’s contribution has been central to this important area of public concern, and his advice, backed up by his research, has been important in informing how we set and apply public sector discounting in the challenging times from the 2008 financial crisis right up until the present.” **\[S3\]** 

 The Chancellor announced in his 2020 Budget statement a further review of the *Green Book*, on which Freeman was consulted. The lead author of the *Green Book* at HM Treasury stated: “Current considerations concerning uneven development within the UK make research in the area of social discounting doubly important, and we expect to be consulting Mark Freeman again this year” **\[S3\]**. In the 2020 edition of the *Green Book*, Freeman’s work was again prominent, and the 2018 report with Groom and Spackman formed a key part of the justification for the discount rate \( **S4,** see especially Section 14\). 

 *• **Setting of the discount rates used in cost\-benefit analysis methods prescribed by the Netherlands government in 2015 and 2020** 

 In 2015 Freeman gave expert advice on long\-term social discounting to a working group of the Ministry of Finance, Netherlands. The government subsequently stated \(translated\): “The Cabinet accepts all the recommendations of the working group... \[and\] has as its starting point that this advice is followed in all policy areas where discounting is involved.” 

 The Ministry’s response was further updated in 2020 and it again extensively used Freeman’s research, including reproducing some of **R5**’s Figures **\[S5\],** as well as the detailed report used by HM Treasury **\[S2\]**, in justification of the long\-term discount rate now widely and compulsorily used across the Netherlands government. In December 2020 the Programme Leader stated: “The Dutch government has accepted all recommendations of the advice on the discount rate. As a result, the advised discount rate is now mandatory in all government cost\-benefit analyses and other policy assessment where discounting plays a role. Cost\-benefit analysis is widely used to inform policy decisions in the Netherlands.” **\[S6\]** 

 *• **Setting of the discount rate applied by the UK Office for National Statistics in the valuation of long\-lived assets in the UK national accounts** 

 In 2016 the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) began a review of the values used for different types of long\-term liabilities and assets in the UK national accounts. The aim was to ensure that appropriate discount rates were set within a common framework and that they could be easily explained and justified. To this end, the ONS commissioned two reports from Freeman and colleagues. 

 With Groom, Freeman authored a 2016 report on the valuation of environmental assets. This was cited in the *UK natural capital accounts methodology guide: October 2019* \(page 5\): “Based on an extensive review by external consultants, the ONS and Defra use the social discount rate set out in the HM Treasury *Green Book*.” In 2017 Freeman and colleagues conducted an external review of the discount rates that the ONS should use in the production of its outputs, resulting in a report that covered a wide range of long\-lived assets. The Deputy Director and Deputy Chief Economist at the ONS commented in 2019: “By providing transparency on the options available and how historic decisions have been taken, this work has helped validate the discount rates used in the national accounts in 2019, delivering a key support to maintaining and implementing the current methodologies.” **\[S7\]** 

 *• **Informing the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation’s guidance on estimating the value of reducing carbon and other GHG emissions** 

 New York State has a population of more than 19 million. In 2020 its Department of Environmental Conservation issued a guidance document to all New York government agencies about calculating the social cost of carbon and other GHG emissions **\[S8\]**. 

 Endorsed by Governor Cuomo, the guidance argued that the discount rates used by the Federal Inter\-agency Working Group underestimated the value of avoided damages from GHG emissions. A new monetary value was therefore established for avoided emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Freeman’s work \(especially **R5**\) was cited as the primary justification for its policy that the social cost of carbon should be calculated at a discount rate of 1\-3% instead of the Federal range of 2.5\-5% **\[S8\]**. In 2020 the Economics Director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University noted that Freeman’s work would “directly lead to New York taking more aggressive climate action.” **\[S9\]** 

 *• **Other engagement with decision\-making bodies** 

 In 2020, with Freeman, with Groom and Turk, delivered a report commissioned by the International Seabed Authority \(ISA\) on appropriate social discount rates. This was to inform decisions on a financial model for the system of payments of deep seabed mining contracts to the ISA. **R4**, **R5** and **S2** contributed heavily to the analysis. ISA, an autonomous organisation established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, views the report as a key input to its policy decision\-making **\[S10\]**. 

 Freeman continues to be consulted by national and international government bodies on the basis of his Loughborough research. Instances during 2020 include an invitation to participate in a review of environmental discounting by HM Treasury; a commissioned think piece \(with Groom\) for the UK Department for Transport; and a request from the US Environmental Protection Agency for advice on estimating the social cost of carbon.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Television is a valuable cultural record and data source for education and knowledge generation. Research at Royal Holloway \(RHUL\) has directly resulted in Box of Broadcasts \(BoB\), the world’s largest archive of TV broadcasts, and EUscreen, a European equivalent. Between them they make available over 2,500,000 items of TV content. Almost all HEIs in the UK subscribe to BoB, using content ranging from news and documentaries to sitcoms and reality shows, to enhance learning and teaching across the curricula. Approximately 1,700,000 programme streams a year are requested by teachers, lecturers and students. In Europe, the pan\-European EUscreen project makes historic TV content universally available. The project has helped to change the perceived value of “ordinary” TV and has enabled many broadcasters to digitize and present their holdings online. In addition to this preservation and dissemination of TV’s programme heritage, RHUL research has secured and demonstrated online the material heritage of TV production technologies and working practices. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Millions of hours of TV exist in the archives, and more is added every day. This vast resource offers many possibilities for teaching, research and heritage activities. RHUL research has explored the four connected challenges in realising this potential: preservation, restoration, access and usability. In the early 2000s, the archive organisations devoted to the preservation of and access to historic TV still assumed that the main area of demand would be in TV “classics”. RHUL research developed a different vision by emphasising the value of “ordinary TV” \(magazine programmes, news items, reality TV, sitcoms and light entertainment as well as programming such as prestige dramas and documentaries\). Researchers then used an action\-research approach to develop the means of searching and accessing the huge collections that would result. Through collaborative research projects and through publications, RHUL researchers drove forward the development of two online resources: Learning on Screen’s Box of Broadcasts and the pan\-European EUscreen project. Throughout they articulated a vision of television programming as a vast repository of data \(R1, R2, R4\). “Digitised TV has become data. This data requires interpretation. This data also enables reinterpretation of the TV material on all kinds of levels that were simply not open to the material in its original analogue state” \(R4, p.30\). 

 RHUL research offers the means of evaluating and exploring ordinary TV as an important education resource as well as a source of information about society. Our research has explored how public service and commercial archives can organise online access and what forms of search are most appropriate for a wide range of cross\-disciplinary users. R3 explores the problems of organisation and search in an international context, offering a model for their resolution. R4 anticipates the use of artificial intelligence to treat digitised TV holdings as big data for research in other disciplines, for example, linguistics and the science of ageing. 

 The final element of RHUL’s research results from the perception that the digitisation of archival TV also alters it, so that future users of its data need to understand how it was created. The editorial constraints of broadcast TV may have been well researched, but technologies and production practices have not. From 2013 to 2018 a project funded by the European Research Council investigated the Adoption of New Technological Arrays in the Production of Broadcast Television \(ADAPT\). Project outputs including R5 and R6 explored the strengths and limitations of TV’s technologies and working practices, which defined what could and could not be shown. Using an innovative Hands on History method, this research galvanised a network of retired television professionals and dedicated amateur collectors of historic equipment to restore it to working order. They were then filmed using the equipment as they once did professionally, generating over 160 videos explaining how analogue TV used to be made, and creating a tangible contribution to the preservation and understanding of TV’s material heritage.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Royal Holloway’s research into the preservation, restoration, access and usability of archival TV has resulted in the return of huge amounts of heritage programming back to active and extensive educational, research and public use. Research projects at RHUL have enabled the creation of Box of Broadcasts, the world’s largest recording and streaming library of TV material, and the EUscreen collection of historic TV from around Europe. Further RHUL research has contributed to the preservation and public understanding of the disappearing analogue technologies which were originally used to create the programmes now made available on these pioneering platforms. The impact has been achieved through national and multinational collaborations with broadcaster archives and digitisation projects. Beneficiaries of the research include broadcaster archives, archive and information professionals, educational charities, TV practitioners, and audiences including educational users \(students, teachers, researchers\) and the wider public. 

 Learning on Screen’s Box of Broadcast \(BoB\) service, based on the online recording of television programmes for educational use, is the world’s largest video streaming library. Unlike other streaming services, it is a permanent library used by 156 subscribing institutions including universities and further education colleges across the UK. Broadcast channels show thousands of hours of TV a day, but most of it soon disappears for ever: the broadcasters’ own streaming services make it available only temporarily. Through its recording service, BoB enables users to adapt TV content for education use, and to have it permanently available. As of May 2020, BoB \(S1\) held 2,385,000 TV and radio programmes drawn from 76 UK broadcast channels. BoB’s strength lies in its crowdsourcing approach. Any individual academic user can request that scheduled broadcast programmes be added, and those programmes then remain permanently available to all. BoB handled 153,573 such requests in the year ending May 2020. Described as “a fantastic resource” by the Library Service of Queen Mary, University of London \(S6\), BoB is a key teaching source for UK education with just under 1,700,000 streams of programmes each year. It contains every genre of programming and is used by all subject areas: business and management are particularly prominent among them. Users have created over 170,000 playlists with subjects as diverse as mathematical modelling, marketing communications, and Black Lives Matter. The creation of BoB is the direct result of RHUL’s contention that “ordinary TV” matters and its research into making such content searchable. 

  

 Ellis’s decisive chairing of Learning on Screen \(formerly British Universities Film and Video Council, BUFVC\) from 2007 has been crucial in developing BoB. According to \[text removed for publication\], BUFVC \[text removed for publication\], Ellis’s \[text removed for publication\]\(S2\). BoB’s origins lie in a service which mailed out DVDs of broadcasts to higher education, under a unique education provision of UK copyright law \(introduced in 1988\). Under Ellis’s leadership, BUFVC transformed this to a streaming service, improving the commercially supplied platform in 2013, and subsequently \(2016\) launching a new version tailored for teaching and research which was developed in\-house by Learning on Screen. BoB’s evolution is similar to that of Netflix which also began as a DVD mailing service but, whereas Netflix still offers a relatively small catalogue, BoB’s crowdsourced collection soon numbered hundreds of thousands of programmes. 

 RHUL research provided crucial input into the design of the search functions and presentation of BoB’s bespoke platform. The platform gives users the ability to select and curate extracts from programmes for a wide variety of educational uses. With such a huge library, searchability is crucial so that users can find the material they need for their teaching and research. RHUL researchers teamed with BUFVC in 2010\-11 on an AHRC\-funded project, “Consolidated Moving Image and Sound Database Framework”, to consolidate BUFVC’s nine disparate databases of TV content into an innovative search environment linked to BoB and capable of returning results from film, TV and radio assets and metadata. The definitive version was launched after user testing in autumn 2013. In \[text removed for publication\] words, it works by \[text removed for publication\] \(S2\). RHUL researchers have also worked with Learning on Screen to user test each stage of BoB’s development. 

 Through its innovative search environment, BoB is enabling new approaches in teaching and learning in higher education and further education. This impact is highlighted in case\-studies publicised by BoB. Chris Willmott, National Teaching Fellow in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Leicester, comments how the searchability allows new ways for students to engage with TV material. “I have also had project students beginning to use BoB … as a research tool. It is becoming feasible to interrogate visual media in a way that is more familiar for, say, newsprint” \(S8\). At Cardiff University’s School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies: “BoB has had a positive and transforming impact on teaching staff, technical support staff and students. The availability of such a wide range of broadcast content has helped promote multimodal teaching within the department, as well as underpinning key research tasks. … BoB has enabled students and lecturers to access examples, key moments and to detect trends and shifts. It has also facilitated an end\-of\-module research assessment that has been well received by both students and external examiners” \(S9\). 

 BoB’s library of British TV is huge, but access is limited, for legal reasons, to the UK education sector. RHUL’s research has emphasised the need for universal access to TV’s programming heritage. As a founding partner in the European EUscreen project \(2009 to 2016\), RHUL’s researchers were able to develop universal and permanent online access to programmes from the archives of European broadcasters. With researchers from Utrecht University and the National Technical University of Athens, RHUL developed a collaboration with 17 European broadcaster archives. At the outset, these broadcasters had widely varying preservation and digitisation practices, with particular problems being faced by archives from newly acceded member states in Eastern Europe. The EUscreen network developed best practices in digitisation and cataloguing. It built a universally accessible web portal to provide cross\-boundary online access to archival material. The project twice gained funding from the EU’s Framework 7. The content selection policies were developed by RHUL working directly with archivists to establish what content they would provide. For the EUscreen web portal, RHUL managed the standard metadata fields and the search terms used in the translation thesaurus that is at the heart of the multilingual search facility. 

 The actively curated EUscreen web portal now gives access to over 60,000 items which were viewed 282,319 times during the period June 2019 \- June 2020 \(S3\). The archival network created during the EUscreen research phase now continues as an independent foundation with 31 institutional members including RHUL meeting regularly and organising conferences for both study and technical exchanges. According to \[text removed for publication\] of the Polish National Film and Audiovisual Archive, \[text removed for publication\] \(S4\). The content acquisition tool developed for EUscreen has been adopted by Europeana, the European digital library as its means of ingesting video material, and the growing EUscreen collection continues to be added to Europeana’s holdings. 

 EUscreen’s work in securing the heritage of television also included the launch of a journal that acts as a forum between professional archivists and academic historians. *VIEW: Journal of European Television History and Culture* is a biannual online peer reviewed journal, with 16 issues by the end of 2020 and another 4 in production. It is “recommended reading” \(S7\) for FIAT/IFTA, the global network organisation for broadcast archives. Ellis remains one of the three editors in chief. The EUscreen project’s development of *VIEW* as a forum for archivists and academics was driven by the perception that TV material from the analogue era is often difficult to appreciate for modern users, and that its value as data can only be realised with reference to how it was originally created. 

 RHUL researchers have also worked to provide new ways of understanding how TV was made in the era of analogue technologies. RHUL used an innovative “hands on history” approach to demonstrate how TV used to be made using analogue video and 16mm film technologies. RHUL researchers worked with amateur collectors and retired technicians to restore a whole range of technologies and then film them being used as they once were every day. The result is an extensive collection of videos which have been absorbed into the Europeana digital library as well as presented through the *How Television Used to be Made* website \(R5\). These provide a valuable means of encouraging public understanding of the real constraints under which most archival TV material was produced. 

 These videos are also frequently used as reference material by art directors, as is evidenced by \[text removed for publication\], the owner of the 1960s outside broadcast truck used in several of them: \[text removed for publication\] \(S5\). The RHUL project also restored \[text removed for publication\] outside broadcast truck North 3 and other technologies to working order so that they could subsequently be used in these productions. This RHUL research has enabled this preservation of the material heritage of TV production as a further dimension to its achievements in the access and usability of historic TV material.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Invasive pneumococcal diseases, including meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, are a major cause of death in young children in resource poor countries, and cause serious illness in developed countries. In 2015, invasive pneumococcus disease was responsible for nearly 300,000 paediatric deaths globally, but pneumococcal vaccine programmes have improved health outcomes for children worldwide. Research on pneumococcal vaccination by University of Oxford, Oxford Vaccine Group \(OVG\) shaped the World Health Organisation’s recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination schedules for infants and was adopted by several low and middle income countries, and directly changed national immunisation policies in the UK and Nepal. The improved UK pneumococcal immunisation strategy has both reduced the number of injections given to infants and provided estimated savings to the NHS of GBP27,500,000 annually. The immunisation strategy in Nepal has led to a 34% reduction in bacterial pneumonia in infants, and averted catastrophic expenditures for thousands of the poorest families.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Pneumococcal infections, caused by *Streptococcus pneumoniae* bacteria, can cause serious invasive diseases including meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines \(PCVs\) reduce pneumococcal disease burden by direct protection and by reducing nasopharyngeal carriage, thereby preventing transmission and inducing herd protection. There are many pneumococcal serotypes and vaccines have been developed against the serotypes most likely to cause serious disease.  In 2010, the original pneumococcal glycoconjugate vaccine, PCV7 \(7\-valent, Pfizer\), was replaced by PCV13 \(13\-valent, Pfizer\) and PCV10 \(10\-valent, GSK\) to provide protection against additional pneumococcal serotypes not covered by PCV7. 

 The greatest proportion of pneumococcal disease occurs in late infancy and in toddlers. Therefore, an ideal vaccine programme would protect children from disease throughout early childhood. Over the last two decades, the Oxford Vaccine Group \(OVG\) at the University of Oxford has led over 20 clinical research studies addressing the prevention of pneumococcal disease through vaccination. 

####  Disease surveillance and clinical trials in low and middle income countries 

 Since 2005, the OVG has led a pneumococcal disease surveillance project at Patan Hospital, Nepal. In 2010, the team demonstrated that pneumococcus was the most common cause of meningitis, pneumonia and infant septicaemia at this hospital \[1\], suggesting that vaccination against pneumococcus could significantly improve the health of children in Nepal. The OVG designed and implemented a phase 4 clinical trial of the PCV10 vaccine in infants in Nepal, starting in 2010 \[2\]. They compared two immunisation schedules: 2 priming doses \(at 6 weeks and 14 weeks old\) plus 1 booster dose \(at 9 months old\), known as a 2\+1 schedule; and a 3\+0 schedule, comprising three priming doses at 6, 10 and 14 weeks old. At that time, the 3\+0 schedule was included in the WHO Expanded Programme of Immunisation schedule and used in most low and middle income countries \(LMICs\). OVG found that the 2\+1 schedule resulted in improved antibody persistence through early childhood compared with the 3\+0 schedule \[2\], providing protection to children throughout the peak risk period of disease transmission. Administering a booster dose at 9 months also provides the opportunity for this to be given the same time as measles immunisation, which may provide logistical and economic advantages in certain settings. 

 Subsequently, starting in 2015, the OVG implemented a further phase 4 clinical trial of PCV10 in Nepal to compare the 2\+1 schedule with immunisations at 6 weeks, 14 weeks and 9 months with an ‘accelerated’ 2\+1 schedule with immunisations at 6 weeks, 10 weeks and 9 months \[3\]. The rationale for this trial was that 2 other immunisations are recommended at 14 weeks of age for infants in Nepal \(pentavalent vaccine and inactivated poliomyelitis virus vaccine\), and there were concerns about public acceptance of 3 immunisations being administered at 14 weeks. The trial showed comparable immune responses for both 2\+1 schedules, validating use of an accelerated prime\-boost schedule where logistically necessary \[3\]. 

 The OVG team also initiated pharyngeal swabbing studies in Nepal. Firstly, in 2012 they enrolled 600 children to determine the local prevalence of circulating pneumococcal serotypes prior to introduction of PCV10 into the national immunisation schedule \[4\]. Their ongoing studies have enrolled nearly 4000 children, enabling continued surveillance of circulating pneumococcal serotypes since the introduction of PCV10. 

####  Pneumococcal vaccine design and UK clinical trials 

 Starting in 2006, the OVG led a phase 4 randomised clinical trial in the UK of the novel PCV13 pneumococcal vaccine to assess immunogenicity and tolerability in a 2\+1 schedule, given at 2, 4 and 12 months of age \[5\]. Their results, published in 2010, demonstrated near\-universal immune response to all serotypes in PCV13, without impacting on concomitantly administered vaccines \[5\], providing support to the UK Department of Health and Social Care decision in 2010 to replace PCV7 with PCV13 in the national immunisation schedule. 

 With the introduction of meningococcal B vaccine into the UK infant immunisation schedule in 2015, there was a need to reduce the number of vaccine doses delivered without compromising disease control. In 2016, the OVG collaborated with University College London and Public Health England to lead a phase 4 randomised clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of a reduced dosing strategy for PCV13: a 1\+1 schedule, with immunisations at 3 and 12 months of age \[6\]. Their study demonstrated an at least equivalent immune response for 9 out of 13 serotypes for this 1\+1 schedule compared with the 2\+1 \(2, 4 and 12 month\) schedule \[6\]. This study was the first in the world to assess a 1\+1 schedule for pneumococcal vaccines.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As the major cause of bacterial meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia, *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is responsible for approximately 3,700,000 cases of severe disease and 500,000 deaths globally each year in young children. The schedule of immunisations is essential for effective and sustainable vaccination programmes, as the exact number and timing of doses influences efficacy, public acceptance, costs, and long\-term sustainability. 

####  Changing global and UK healthcare policy 

 **World Health Organisation, and low and middle income countries:** In Nepal, in Nov 2013 the National Committee on Immunisation Practices \(NCIP\) recommended the introduction of the PCV10 pneumococcal vaccine into the national immunisation schedule for infants \[A\], based on the OVG’s research \[1, 2, 4\]. Specifically, a 2\+1 dosing schedule was chosen instead of 3\+0, based on the OVG trial data \[2\]. Based on the NCIP recommendation, from 2015, PCV10 was implemented in the Nepalese infant immunisation schedule, available to more than 500,000 infants per year. Further, the OVG’s research \[3\] validated the choice in Nepal to use an ‘accelerated’ 2\+1 dosing schedule, which was more acceptable to the public and the research showed was as effective as the standard 2\+1 schedule. 

 The OVG research demonstrating benefits of using a 2\+1 versus a 3\+0 dosing schedule in Nepal \[2\] was extensively referenced in a 2017 systematic review of the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which was prepared for the WHO Special Advisory Group of Experts \(SAGE\) for immunisation \[B\]. In Feb 2019, the WHO recommended a 2\+1 schedule for infant immunisation against pneumococcal disease \[C\], informed by this systematic review and the OVG research \[2, 3\] \[D\]. Based on these WHO recommendations, as of Nov 2020, 2\+1 schedules for PCVs had been adopted for routine infant immunisations by 7 LMICs receiving support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations \(GAVI\), in addition to Nepal: India, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Moldova \[E\]. This implementation of the 2\+1 immunisation schedule applies to approximately 30,700,000 infants each year across these 8 countries. Notably, India had the world’s highest number of pneumococcal deaths in 2015 and introduced routine immunisation following the 2\+1 schedule in 2017 \[E\], prioritising states with the highest pneumonia burden. 

 **UK vaccination schedules:** In October 2017, the UK Joint Committee for Vaccines and Immunisation \(JCVI\) reviewed data from the OVG\-led trial comparing a 2\+1 to a 1\+1 schedule for PCV13 \[6\] and, based on this research, made a recommendation to the UK Department of Health and Social Care that the UK infant immunisation schedule should be changed from the 2\+1 schedule \(immunisations at 2, 4 and 12 months\) to a 1\+1 schedule \(immunisations at 3 and 12 months\) \[Fi\]. Public Health England announced in April 2019 that the new 1\+1 schedule should be offered to all infants born on or after 1 Jan 2020 \[Fii\]. This was the first implementation of a 1\+1 PCV13 schedule in the world.  This trial and change in the UK policy is a landmark that provided credibility and reassurance to other countries that reduced dosing is safe and has cost benefits, instigating further studies in India, Vietnam, South Africa and the Gambia, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to see if this reduced dose schedule is similarly immunogenic in LMICs \[Gi\]. Indeed, results from the study in South Africa \(referencing \[6\]\), confirmed that the 1\+1 schedule was not inferior to 2\+1 in a LMIC with an established PCV immunisation programme, providing the opportunity to reduce the cost of PCV procurement \[Gii\]. 

####  Improving health outcomes for children 

 **Decreased invasive pneumococcal disease and fewer injections for infants in the UK:** The switch from PCV7 to PCV13 in the UK vaccination schedule in 2010, which was influenced by OVG research \[5\] showing that PCV13 was highly immunogenic and well tolerated in the UK schedule \[H\], resulting in large decreases in cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, including since August 2013. Specifically, a PHE study showed that in 2013/14 the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in England and Wales had decreased by 32% compared to the level before the introduction of PCV13 immunisations; this resulted in at least 1,800 fewer cases of these serious, life\-threatening infections in 2013/14 \[Ii\]. A further PHE study showed that, in 2016/17, invasive pneumococcal disease cases resulting from PV13\-type serotypes had decreased by 64% since the introduction of PCV13 \[Iii\]. Overall, PHE data from England and Wales, shows that pneumococcal vaccination has prevented an estimated 9,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under 5 between 2013\-2017 \[Iii,iii\]. 

 Implementation of the 1\+1 immunisation schedule in the UK resulted in approximately 750,000 fewer doses of pneumococcal vaccine being administered annually. Fewer injections means less distress and discomfort for infants and their parents. Mathematical modelling by PHE, based on the immunogenicity data from the trial led by the OVG \[6\], indicated that this reduction in discomfort through reducing the number of injections will not cause any significant loss of control of pneumococcal disease, with an estimate of only 2 additional cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in children under 2 years, over 5 a year period \[J\]. 

 **Global decreases in pneumococcal deaths, severe disease and economic impacts:** The global mortality rate for pneumococcus in 2015 was estimated to be 45 deaths \(uncertainty range 29–56\) per 100,000 children under the age of 5, with uncertainty in part due to the pathogen not being identified in many cases of pneumonia \[K\]. Overall, pneumococcal vaccine programs, including those based on OVG research, have resulted in a mean annual reduction of global paediatric deaths from invasive pneumococcal disease of 47,400 between 2010 and 2015, and an estimation that this reduction will have been at least equalled for every year since 2013 \[K\]. As of November 2020, 138 countries, including 58 LMICs, had introduced a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into their national immunisation schedule \[E\], and a minimal estimate is that 22,800,000 children across the world have been immunised against pneumococcal infections \[E\]. Nepal is an illustrative example of the impact, where the vaccine programme was heavily influenced by the OVG research: in 2018 there was a 34% reduction in cases \(at least 15,500 fewer cases per year\) of bacterial pneumonia in children compared to the pre\-vaccination period \(2014\-2015\)\[Li\]; and by 2019, carriage of vaccine\-serotype pneumococcus had decreased by 74% among healthy infants \[Li\]. Pneumococcal disease has a major economic impact on poor families, through costs of healthcare and loss of earnings; for example, in Nepal, out\-of\-pocket payments for pneumonia hospitalizations exceeded 40% of the monthly household spending for more than 70% of households in the three poorest quintiles \[Lii\]. Analysis of the impact of introduction of the PCV10 vaccination in Nepal estimated that vaccination averted 85% of catastrophic health expenditures among the poorest quintiles of the population \[Liii\]. 

####  Financial benefits to the NHS 

 The reduction in doses of PCV13 administered in the UK, through introduction of the 1\+1 schedule from 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2020, has resulted savings to the NHS of GBP7,500,000 in vaccine administration costs alone, with additional savings through reduced vaccine purchasing costs. The ‘shelf price’ of this vaccine is GBP49 per dose and, although NHS purchase price is not publicly available, the total annual savings to the NHS for 2020 are estimated as at least GBP20,000,000.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study describes how research into contamination risks for leafy salads and subsequent persistence of foodborne illness organisms, e.g. *E. coli*, led to production of industry focussed resources, namely: 

-  Web\-based risk assessment tools for irrigation water, manure use and worker hygiene 

-  Factsheet on managing microbial contamination risks 

-  Formal industry guide to watercress production. 

 These are key resources used by fresh produce businesses to develop robust food safety management systems that comply with legal and commercial standards within UK and international supply chains. This has been linked to a direct benefit to consumers through avoidance of illness, hospitalisation and prevention of deaths.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Pathogenic *E. coli* \(e.g. O157:H7, O104:H4\) outbreaks have frequently been linked with consumption of lettuce and leafy greens. These outbreaks have led to hospitalisation and deaths and consequently reduced consumption of implicated crops. The underpinning research described here: 

-  assessed production practices; 

-  quantified the risks of contaminating crops under normal growing conditions and the persistence of microbial contamination under the same conditions; 

-  evaluated the efficacy of interventions \(such as hygiene practices\) that should be implemented by primary producers. 

 The studies were funded by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board \(AHDB\) and the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\)<sup>3.</sup><sup>1</sup><sup>–3.</sup><sup>5</sup>, and the International Life Science Institute \(ILSI\)<sup>3.</sup><sup>6</sup>. 

 <ins>Irrigation</ins><ins>:</ins> <ins>q</ins><ins>uantifying</ins> <ins>its</ins> <ins>pathogen contamination risk</ins> 

 The programme of work started with an FSA funded review that highlighted that growers required guidance on microbial food safety and undertaking microbial risk assessments \(RA\)<sup>3.</sup><sup>1</sup>.  Consequently, the AHDB funded a programme of research to quantify the risk of pathogen contamination through irrigation water. The work was innovative, moving theoretical lab\-based approaches into commercially relevant field conditions. For the first time in temperate conditions, the distribution and decline of non\-pathogenic microbes were quantified over the growing season in the soil and on the leaf surface of leafy salad crops<sup>3.</sup><sup>2</sup>. 

 The study also looked at the role of irrigation systems, in reducing the risk of contamination and the distribution of bacteria through soil splash. This work was of international relevance and quantified, for the first\-time, soil splash as a vector of potential microbial contamination in field production<sup>3.</sup><sup>3</sup>. 

 <ins>Direct handling of</ins> <ins>produce</ins><ins>: establishing cause of a foodborne illness outbreak</ins> 

 The subsequent FSA research was in response to a UK outbreak of verocytotoxigenic *E. coli* \(VTEC\) O157 in 2011 that was linked to domestic preparation of unwrapped leeks, or potatoes bought in paper sacks. The study quantified the persistence of faecal contamination on workers’ hands and quantified, for the first time, the transfer of microbial contamination to a root crop through direct handling. The efficacy of a number of handwashing approaches was also studied<sup>3.</sup><sup>4</sup>. 

 Crops were grown at HAU following standard commercial practice and a marker for *E. coli* O157 \(nontoxigenic *E. coli* O145\) was applied, in slurry and irrigation water, to the crops. The persistence of the marker was quantified through processing and simulated supply chain conditions and avoided the issues that can arise from using lab adapted strains of markers<sup>3.</sup><sup>5</sup>. The work established that it was plausible that the cause of a foodborne outbreak involving *E. coli* O157, in 2011, was soil contamination carried through the supply chain and into the domestic kitchen<sup>3.</sup><sup>5</sup>. 

 <ins>Developing international guidance</ins> <ins>on microbial</ins> <ins>r</ins><ins>isk</ins> <ins>a</ins><ins>ssessment for leafy vegetables</ins> 

 As a consequence of this research, Monaghan was invited on to the ILSI Europe \- Risk Analysis in Microbiology Expert Group \(2013\-16\) to develop a formal RA framework for primary producers of leafy vegetables<sup>3.</sup><sup>6</sup>. The scope of the study was to develop internationally relevant guidance, and the membership of the expert group reflected this with members from France, Netherlands and UK. The work was then publicised by the International Association of Food Protection \(IAFP\) through an international \(US and Europe\) webinar and invited presentations at IAFP meetings in Greece and Sweden.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Foodborne outbreaks associated with fresh produce are mainly caused by bacterial zoonoses, including pathogenic E. coli and are a serious problem, therefore managing microbial food safety in fresh produce is a key focus in the agri\-food industry. Risk Assessment \(RA\) and Good Agricultural Practice \(GAP\) are essential components of industry\-led food safety management systems, such as Red Tractor Farm Assurance and GlobalGAP \(the worldwide standard for GAP\), and are a legal requirement of Regulation \(EC\) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs. 

 The research described in Section 2 has produced impact in two major ways: 

-  firstly, by advising the UK fresh produce industry on GAP to reduce microbial contamination. 

-  secondly, by providing guidance on microbial risk assessment to assess the contamination risks from water, manure and worker hygiene. 

1.  <ins>Advis</ins><ins>ing</ins> <ins>UK fresh produce industry on</ins> <ins>GAP</ins> <ins>to reduce microbial contamination</ins> 

1.  <ins>First</ins> <ins>fresh produce</ins> <ins>guidelines</ins> <ins>written a</ins><ins>nd incorporated into UK standards</ins> 

 Monaghan & Hutchison were commissioned by AHDB and FSA to establish guidelines to manage microbial contamination and to disseminate these through a factsheet, aimed at commercial growers and the wider supply chain<sup>5.1</sup>.  The factsheet summarised the different microbial hazards, the contamination routes through which they can contaminate crops, the best practices to minimise these contamination events and the monitoring of inputs and crops that can be used. Research and results from Ref 3.2 and Ref 3.3 were incorporated into the guidelines/factsheet which was published in 2010. 

 The launch of the factsheet was supported by nine roadshows delivered by Monaghan around the UK to publicise the factsheet. These events were attended by key growers from the major high\-risk crop producers in all four UK nations. 

 Comprehensive, practical guidelines were needed by the industry. When released, the fresh produce sector was coming under pressure from the retail supply chain to manage microbial contamination following a high\-profile *E. coli* O157 outbreak linked to salads in the USA.  The factsheet was the first comprehensive material in the UK targeted at growers<sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup> and was written in a manner that provided practical guidance to mitigate risks<sup>5.</sup><sup>3</sup>. 

 The impact of the factsheet was significant. Commercial businesses incorporated the guidance into their own food safety procedures<sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>, 5.</sup><sup>3</sup><sup>, 5.</sup><sup>4</sup>. The information in the factsheet was incorporated into the Red Tractor Farm Assurance standards used by the whole industry<sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>,5.</sup><sup>4</sup> and, importantly, when being audited against Red Tractor standards. This demonstrated that the access and use of the factsheet by a grower is accepted as evidence of compliance to specific audit points<sup>5.</sup><sup>2</sup>. Critically, this work “has had direct benefits for consumers and wider society through avoidance of illness and hospitalisation and prevention of deaths in high\-risk groups”<sup>5.</sup><sup>4</sup>.

 Monaghan was also commissioned by FSA to author the first *Industry Guide to Good Hygiene Practice: Watercress* providing information on legal obligations for producers and what their compliance with food hygiene law. Results from Monaghan’s research<sup>3.</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>, 3.</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>,</sup> <sup>3.</sup><sup>6</sup> were incorporated into the guidance, and were applied as follows. 

-  Official recognition by the FSA and Food Standards Scotland \(FSS\) and subsequent compliance with the relevant legislation<sup>5.</sup><sup>5</sup>.  Nearly all watercress growers, both small\- and large\-scale businesses now follow the industry guide. No foodborne illness outbreaks linked to UK grown watercress have occurred since the guide was introduced. 

-  Implementation of recommendations from the Industry Guide by UK watercress growers for crops grown in Spain and Portugal within these international supply chains<sup>5.</sup><sup>6</sup>.

 Monaghan & Hutchison were also commissioned by AHDB/FSA to develop a web\-based Risk Assessment tool for fresh produce growers which was released in 2010, and revised in 2014, 2018 and 2021<sup>5.</sup><sup>7</sup>. The tool consists of a matrix of questions that the grower completes and moves through the RA process. At each question there is also a brief rationale and links to detailed grower accessible evidence, summarised from the research<sup>3.</sup><sup>2</sup><sup>,</sup> <sup>3.</sup><sup>3</sup> and later Ref 3.4, 3.5 & 3.6. This was the first industry\-wide RA tool developed in the UK, and the FSA, FSS and Red Tractor all promote using the web tool as best practice<sup>5.</sup><sup>8</sup>. 

 Compliance with Red Tractor Fresh Produce grower standards is mandatory in all UK major retailers and the standards are followed by approximately 2,500 growers representing greater than 90% of UK growers. Uptake has been high as the tool is readily accessible and enables risk management in areas where grower expertise is limited<sup>5.</sup><sup>4</sup> and provided step by step ways to mitigate the risks in a way that farming businesses could accommodate and adapt to<sup>5.</sup><sup>3</sup>. 

 In the last 3 years the RA tool has been used for 4,676 individual assessments.

 Research conducted at Coventry University determined the importance of droplet volume on analysing wettability and adhesion properties of liquids on porous media and demonstrated the importance of wetting transitions and mixed state wetting regimes for adhesion applications. Global manufacturers and distributors of surface and interfacial science measurement equipment used this research to increase their commercial offerings to clients in the ink\-jet printing industry and to change their marketing strategy. In addition, the research has enhanced the research and development of inks and substrates, and wettability analysis techniques have been implemented by these clients to enhance product development and manufacturing processes. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr David G. Waugh \(Associate Professor\) and Professor Jonathan Lawrence at the Coventry University Institute for Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering conduct fundamental and applied research in wettability science and adhesion science. Dr Waugh and Professor Lawrence were invited to collaborate with DataPhysics Instruments GmbH to provide wettability expertise to optimise their ink development process for the ink\-jet industry. Their research showed the importance of liquid droplet size for applying wettability science to the development of inks and substrates using the DataPhysics Instruments picolitre droplet dispensing system \(PDDS\) \[R1\]. This research determined the variation in contact angle on porous media using microlitre, μL \(0.2\-5 μL\), and picolitre, pL \(15\-380 pL\), droplets for wettability analysis. By successfully applying picolitre droplet volume wettability analysis to develop wetting envelopes, this approach was shown to predict ink\-jet printing quality accurately and highlighted how the PDDS can be used to emulate ink\-jet printing for ink and substrate development. The impact of absorption and evaporation on different droplet volume sizes used, also demonstrated that both absorption and droplet volume are key when analysing inks on porous printing substrates \[R1\]. 

 Dr Waugh and Professor Lawrence have carried out an extensive study into the effects of surface engineering on wetting surface parameters, such as wetting transitions and mixed state wetting regimes \[R2\]. It was found that the contact angle and determination of associated surface\-free energies \(the combined surface properties determining adhesion\) can be used to provide important information on the adhesion properties of materials for different applications \[R2, R3\]. This key knowledge is having significant impact in those industries which rely heavily on adhesion science. The research has also been effective in highlighting how surface properties of materials can be modified, optimizing a material for specific applications such as bioengineering and developing bio\-implant materials \[R3\]. 

 The research on PDDS and wetting surface parameters has enabled DataPhysics Instruments to enhance their own research and development processes optimising the approach to applying wettability and adhesion science to not only the ink\-jet industry, but more widely to other industrial applications. This has also led to the industry to achieving a better understanding of state\-of\-the\-art knowledge in wetting.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The major impact of this research has been its use by DataPhysics Instruments GmbH, C. Gerhardt UK Ltd, and their clients who operate in a number of industries. The collaboration between Dr Waugh, Professor Lawrence and DataPhysics Instruments has enabled a shift in research and development practice in the ink\-jet and textile printing industries. As a result of the Coventry University research, there has been Impact on Research and Development strategies, as well as changes in Marketing strategies with Commercial benefit to DataPhysics Instruments and Gerhardt Ltd. New sales have been generated as a direct result of the implementation of the research findings. 

###  *Impact on Research and Development strategies* 

 As a result of the Coventry research, a new best\-practice approach has been made available by DataPhysics Instruments, offering an optimised picolitre wettability science analysis to ink and substrate research and development. This has provided new industrial capability in the form of 

 an application to ink jet research and development, utilising picolitre volume droplets and their newly developed picolitre droplet dispensing system \(PDDS\). Identifying and developing this new application for the PDDS has had direct impact on the speed and quality of research and development output for a number of industry consumers. Not only can industry now use wettability science and the wetting envelope model to ascertain whether a developed ink is optimised more quickly, they can also make use of this knowledge to determine optimum liquid and substrate parameters needed, based on the printing application. Ultimately, this provides a faster and more efficient means to determine the optimised parameters for inks and substrates. The Managing Director of DataPhysics Instruments writes: 

 *“Increased understanding of the importance of droplet volume provided by this research, has enabled us to increase our commercial offering to ink jet industry companies and textile printing companies, who require a more efficient and enhanced way to carry out their research and development, allowing them to accelerate the development of new inks and printing substrates, ready for market.”* \[S1\] 

###  *Impact on Marketing Strategy and Commercial sales* 

 Dataphysics Instruments equipment can be applied to any and all areas of wettability and adhesion. These include, but are not limited to, ink jet printing, non\-stick technologies, anti\-icing and de\-icing technologies, water harvesting, electrical engineering and electronics and resin preservative treatments. The research on the PDDS system has enabled DataPhysics Instruments to reinvigorate their marketing strategy for this ink dispensing system. The DataPhysics Instruments Sales and Applications Teams have been able to inform their clients of the benefits of using picolitre droplet technologies, within their research and development departments. Direct commercial impact has been achieved through additional sales generation and increased revenue. The Managing Director of DataPhysics Instruments adds: 

 *“In particular, we have been able to exploit the research to demonstrate a new application for our picolitre droplet dispensing system \(PDDS\) and how that can be used to enhance the development of inks and printing substrates.”* \[S1\] 

 In relation to sales and sales strategy, he states: 

 *“This has informed our new marketing strategy for the PDDS systems, which includes this capability. On the strength of this, we have secured an additional 195,000 Euro \(approximately £170,000\) sales and generated a notable and promising increase in sales enquiries.”* \[S1\] 

 Similar commercial impact has been achieved for one of DataPhysics Instruments’ distributors. The Product Manager at Gerhardt Ltd writes: 

 *“By using and showcasing the research works listed to different industries, such as polymer/metallic component manufacture and adhesive manufacture and use, we have been able to achieve an increase in sales enquiries of 25%.”* \[S2\] 

 A renewed marketing strategy, underpinned by the Coventry University research, has garnered both increased sales enquiries and actual sales for Gerhardt Ltd. The Product Manager at Gerhardt Ltd states: 

 *“I would immediately identify two significant sales, one to a speciality chemical manufacturer and one to a carbon fibre recovery/reuse company, where we gained tangible benefit from being able to reference the adhesion/wettability work featured in the above IJWST paper. Each of these sales represented investments of over £30k, for the companies involved and I am confident that the commercial advantage that they have gained, within their fields of operation, have returned that investment many times over.”* \[S2\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 From 2001 to 2020, children and young people \(CYP\) in England with life\-limiting and life\-threatening conditions rose from c.33,000 to c.87,000 \(Fraser et al, 2020\), and advances in treatments mean many highly\-dependent CYP now survive longer and live at home with their families. Research led by Professor Jane Coad and Team focused on experiences of this group and their carers, to ensure a stronger choice, voice and better quality of life. Research outcomes have been used by NICE, NHS, and sector charities internationally to develop specialist training, enhance resource allocation, and influence policies and guidelines to improve care services.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Since 2011, Professor Jane Coad</ins> <ins>and team</ins> <ins>at Coventry University used innovative participatory arts\-based methods to explore health and well\-being for CYP with complex care needs. Coad began work with UK charity ‘Together for Short Lives’ \(</ins><ins>TfSL</ins><ins>\) to explore how well services in the West Midlands met palliative care needs for CYP and families. Initial research with Anne Hunt \(partner UCLAN\) established a user\-informed picture of the issues facing this group \[R1\], which led to an extensive multi\-partner Big Lottery Funding project \(2011\-2014, G1\) to evaluate national provision.</ins> 

 <ins>Coad led Strand 2, an appreciative inquiry \(a co\-research method enabling stakeholders to explore and self\-define care needs\) which used arts\-based tools to gauge participants’ use and response to services. Research indicated that CYP and their families felt medical/nursing needs were well met but provision was needed for broader financial, social and emotional support alongside more responsive specialist therapies \[R2\]. Findings about perceptions of met and unmet health needs of CYP and families were reported to</ins> <ins>TfSL</ins> <ins>\[R3\], representing applied research in an underexplored area. R1\-2 also underpinned a subsequent project with the charity</ins> <ins>Well</ins><ins>C</ins><ins>hild</ins><ins>, eval</ins><ins>uating their nursing provision \[G2\]</ins><ins>.</ins> 

 <ins>Beginning the same year and collaborating with Professor Diane Harcourt \(Partner: UWE Bristol\), Coad investigated the experiences of CYP living with neurofibromatosis type 1 \(a genetic condition resulting in varying degrees of visible difference\), and the psychosocial impacts of living with the condition \[R5\]. Findings underlined a need for trustworthy information and practical advice to support adjustment for CYP with the condition \[R5\].</ins> 

 <ins>From 2012\-2015 the CU team including Coad, Ashley and Kaur were also commissioned by the Teenage Cancer Trust \(TCT\) to conduct an action research project of a new pilot of specialist nurses across the North West of England</ins> <ins>\[G5\]</ins><ins>, which established ways arts\-based methods could be used in real\-world settings to understand views CYP have of health preferences \[R6\].  Results integrated young people and families’ voices into the care provided for the first time, and led to important changes to service provision.</ins> 

 <ins>Drawing on all of this work, from 2015\-2018 Coad, Ashley/Thomas and Toft with Joseph Manning \(University of Nottingham\) led the first UK rapid review investigating the use of a ‘blended diet’ for CYP fed via a gastrostomy tube, as an alternative to prescribed formula feeds \(G3\). A controversial and emotive issue for</ins> <ins>carers</ins><ins>, research was carried out with a number of hospices, health trusts, following an initia</ins><ins>l project with the charity</ins> <ins>WellC</ins><ins>hild</ins> <ins>\[G4\]</ins><ins>. Findings indicated that blended diet could offer health benefits, and supported families’ cultural desire to nurture and feed, but that there was no gold standard to help guide choices \[R4\].</ins> 

 <ins>Overall, the research \[R1\-6, G1\-4\] revealed new insights into how CYP with complex care needs and their families experience, engage and navigate care services, and highlighted an imperative for:</ins> 

  

1.  <ins>Health professionals to support CYP with complex care needs and their families in offering choice, respecting diversity and enabling their voices in services;</ins> 

1.  <ins>All stakeholders to work together, across systems to improve patient\-centred services and health outcomes;</ins> 

1.  <ins>Health care that is user\-led, and user\-centred.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research on CYP with complex care needs has driven changes in three areas: informing national and international policies/guidance, helping develop specialist health services, and enabling CYP and their families to have a greater voice in provision. 

 <ins>Policies and Guidelines</ins> 

 Together for Short Lives \(TfSL\) supports over 50,000 children living with life\-limiting conditions and families in the UK. Working closely with TfSL, the qualitative component of The Big Study \[R1\-3, G2\] led by Coad was, according to TFSL Director of Research, ‘pivotal in…highlighting the voices of children and their families’, providing evidence ‘incorporated throughout the work of TfSL’, informing palliative care services, and underpinning advice and support offered \[S1\]. The research also provided ‘credible evidence’ which ‘added weight’ to calls for additional funding to develop provision, and informed ‘the breadth’ of their lobbying work’ \[S1\]. 

 As ‘one of the most robust studies… in children’s palliative care’, its evidence on needs assessment was used to inform the key TfSL publications ‘Guide to the Development of Children’s Palliative Care Services’ and ‘Core Care Pathway for Children with Life\-limiting and Life\-threatening Conditions’ \[S1, 2\]. These continued to be used across the UK by ‘a range of providers in hospitals, hospices and community’; the latter ‘has been translated and adapted for use’ by the International Children’s Palliative Care Network, who use it as a ‘key tool’ in ‘countries where children’s palliative care is less developed \(Africa, Portugal, Norway, Hungary and the Crimea\)’ \[S1\]. 

 In 2016 NICE referenced the research in their ‘Guidelines on End of Life Care for Infants and CYP’ \[S1; S3, p.66\-68\], directly informing guidance concerning effective, timely, and honest provision of information for patients and parents. The document also used the Big Study’s identification of significant unmet psychological needs of CYP and carers to justify their recommendation for further research on emotional support in this area \[S3, p.258\-59\]. 

 At a regional level, the NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups for Birmingham \(with  over 49,000 CYP with life\-limiting conditions\) used Strand 2 of the Big Study in their published strategy for developing CYP palliative and end of life services in the region, produced July 2016 \[S4\]. The strategy drew on CU’s work to advocate for 'co\-ordinated healthcare, with the option of…care being delivered in the home' and for the centring of CYP and families’ wishes regarding needs within service provision, and continues to underpin individual CCG operational planning \[S4\]. 

 Following research on blended diets \(2012\-17\), the CU team led two national workshops and a number of stakeholder consultations including the British Dietetic Association and British Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. Having previously firmly recommended against the practice, as a result TfSL and a number of NHS Trusts \(including Leicestershire, Isle of Wight, and Torbay and South Devon\) shifted policies to better support those wishing to follow blended diets \[S5\].  In November 2019 the British Dietetic Association released a policy statement with new recommendations for a ‘shared decision\-making approach’ to blended diets, informed by Coad’s research \[S6\]. 

 <ins>Changing practice in specialist services</ins> 

 Every year approximately 2,500 UK 16\-24\-year olds are diagnosed with cancer. In 2014 Coad and team led an evaluation for a Teenage Cancer Trust \(TCT\) pilot, aiming to bridge a gap in CYP cancer support by providing specialist nurses to work alongside existing treatment teams \[R6, S7\]. The ‘innovative…pilot and evaluation’ won the Nursing Times’ inaugural Prince of Wales Award for Integrated Approaches to Care in 2015 \[S7\]. The evaluation was embedded in TCT’s 2016 Blueprint of Care \[S7\], providing the research base for them to advocate for this specialist nursing provision internally, within the NHS, and funders \[S7\]. As a result, TCT was able to expand its specialist nursing provision from the North\-West pilot, increasing from four nurses to 64 by 2018 to support all of young people with cancer in the UK \[S7\]. 

 <ins>Giving voice</ins> 

 WellChild is a national charity dedicated to enabling children to be cared for at home via a dedicated nurse network. From 2013 to 2015 Coad evaluated their specialist nursing provision, the recommendations led the charity to shift focus to ‘the families’ perspective’ \[S8\]. The caring role of families ‘had previously been underestimated’ by WellChild, so nurses began to focus on training families, allowing ‘more children to leave hospital and be cared at home’ \[S8\].  This developed into a ‘UK\-wide training summit’ in 2015, supported by NHS England, and new family training principles were launched by WellChild in 2018 \[S8\]. 

 The evaluation focused attention on the 24/7 nature of caring for CYP with palliative and complex care needs, which led to the launch of ‘\#notanursebut’, a parent\-driven campaign to highlight the realities of life for these families and identify gaps in support \[S8, 9\]. The project also informed the development of the WellChild Family Tree network, launched in 2014: a free\-to\-join, peer\-support network which by 2020 had grown to support over 2500 families across the UK. As one parent testifies, through the network ‘You are never alone. There will always be someone else in the WellChild Family tree to offer advice and support’ \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Donovan has demonstrated that domestic violence and abuse \(DVA\) in lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or trans \(LGBT\) relationships is poorly understood and recognized within agencies involved with DVA, and that victims and survivors do not receive the same support as their heterosexual counterparts. Her research has enhanced the knowledge of key DVA and LGBT rights stakeholders, leading to changes in national and local DVA strategies and services across the UK. It underpins the training practitioners complete to deliver these services and to date 4,766 practitioners are known to have completed such training. The research is used to justify funding for capacity\-building and is beginning to shape public discussion and awareness through creative partnerships. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The original, multi\-method research was an ESRC\-funded collaboration between the Universities of Sunderland and Bristol entitled ‘Comparing love and violence in same sex and heterosexual relationships’ \(PI: Donovan\). From a comparative social science perspective, it was the first project of its kind in that it focusses on women and men across gender and sexuality. Methods included a national community survey of ‘what happens when things go wrong’ in same sex relationships; focus groups with heterosexual women, men, lesbians and gay men; and interviews with 67 heterosexual women, men, and self\-defined non\-heterosexual women and men. The survey was designed to allow comparison with the British Crime Survey \(BCS\) as a proxy for the heterosexual experience of domestic violence. Interviews focussed on respondents’ ‘worst’ and ‘best’ relationship experiences so that accounts of love and violence could be explored. 

 Specific insights include: 

 a. DVA \(when one partner exerts power and control over the other partner using physical, financial, sexual, emotional, isolating, threatening behaviours\) is a substantial problem in same sex relationships in the UK; 

 b. DVA in same sex relationships is often not recognised as such because of the impact of the public story which identifies DVA as a heterosexual problem of men for women; as a problem of predominantly physical violence; and as a problem of gender in that the ‘bigger, stronger’ embodied male exerts power and control over the ‘smaller, weaker’ embodied female; 

 c. The public story also impacts negatively on the help\-seeking of victim/survivors in same sex relationships as they fear responses of disbelief, minimisation, denial and/or homo/bi\-phobia; and because of the subsequent gap of trust between these victim/survivors and mainstream and specialist DVA services. For example, findings showed that out of ten potential help/support sources, victims and survivors approached the police the least, whilst the British Crime Survey shows that the police are the second or third choice for heterosexual women \(depending on whether friends and family are grouped together or separately\); 

 d. mutual abuse, rather than being common amongst same sex relationships \(because of the assumption made that two women or two men must be ‘equal’\), is rare and in most cases one partner exerts power and control over the other. 

 e. those in first same sex relationships were often at risk of experiencing domestic violence because they did not ‘know’ what to expect in a same sex relationship and/or believed it to be normal; 

 f. there is a need for LGBT DV training and awareness raising amongst mainstream and DV specialist agencies; and 

 g. there is a need for awareness\-raising among LGBT communities. 

 Subsequent research by Donovan \(March\-June 2010\) explored the treatment of LGBT DVA victim/survivors by the national DV strategy as enacted through the Multi\-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences \(MARACs\) and Independent Domestic Violence Advocates \(IDVAs\). This strategy focuses resources on those victim/survivors at the highest risk. Nationally LGBT referrals to the MARAC are disproportionately low. A study exploring barriers to referring LGBT victim/survivors to MARACs identified the following insights: 

 a. there is a need for training and awareness\- raising about LGBT DV in agencies potentially referring victim/survivors to the MARACs but especially the police \- particularly in relation to the use of the risk assessment tool and the specific vulnerabilities of LGBT victim/survivors of DVA; 

 b. most referrals to MARACs are from the police yet very few LGBT victim/survivors report to the police so they are unlikely to be referred to the MARAC; 

 c. domestic violence in same sex relationships is not recognised either within LGBT communities or within mainstream or specialist agencies; 

 d. the public story about DV — whilst accurate for the majority of cases of domestic violence — should not be the only model portrayed in the literature of agencies or in domestic violence campaigns.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Donovan’s research has transformed understanding of DVA in LGBT relationships among the LGBT community, relevant agencies and the general public. This change has, in turn, informed the way policy makers, front\-line professionals and campaigners meet the needs of LGBT victims and survivors. 

###  <ins>Conceptual impact</ins> 

 Donovan’s findings run against mainstream discourses of DVA as physical violence perpetrated by large, strong men against small, weak women. This narrative implies that if DVA takes place between two women, the abuse is not significant; likewise, in the case of two men, it will be seen as something normal, as violence between men is ‘natural’. By identifying the reality of DVA in LGBT relationships, the pathways survivors use to access support, and the inequality of DVA provision for victims and survivors in LGBT relationships compared to heterosexual, Donovan’s research has created a more accurate understanding of the issue. 

 Key stakeholders single out Donovan’s research as the source of their own understanding of DVA in LGBT relationships. The CEO of **SAY\-iT**, a charity supporting young LGBT people, says that before engaging with Donovan’s research, he “ *made assumptions about it being the norm and the price we paid for being in same sex relationships*.” Donovan’s research “ *led to a degree of consciousness and awareness raising both for me, my colleagues and my peers*, \[and it\] *enabled me to refocus and recognise violent and controlling and coercive behaviours which had previously not been apparent*” \[ **S1**\]. Likewise, the national domestic abuse charity **SafeLives** say that “ *Her research has provided evidence and a framework for how we can gain a more nuanced understanding of what’s happening in a relationship*,” and that without this work, “ *our understanding of DVA in LGBT relationships would be blunted*” \[ **S2**\]. **Galop**, the national LGBT\+ anti\-violence charity, attest that “ *Donovan’s research is one of the first to shed light on the experiences of survivors and perpetrators of DVA in LGBT relationships in the UK. Until then, understanding of these experiences was based on data from other countries predominantly USA. Local data was needed to inform policy decisions and shape professional and practitioner knowledge; Donovan’s research addresses this gap*.” \[ **S3**\] 

###  <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>policy\-making</ins> 

 Donovan’s research has influenced policy making in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland \[ **S4**, **S5**\] both through stakeholders such **Galop**, **SafeLives** and **Broken Rainbow** \(who have incorporated their new understanding from the research into their lobbying\) and through policy makers using the findings themselves. Since August 2013, Donovan’s work has shaped strategies, processes, recommendations and needs assessments in **25 local and national government organisations and executive government agencies** including the **Northern Ireland Department of Justice** and **NICE** \[ **S4**\]. The sheer volume of references to Donovan’s research in government and organisational policies confirms her position as an authority among policy\-makers, civil servants and other officials. 

 These strategies, needs assessments and other official publications translate the findings into service design. For example, after acknowledging differences in the nature of abuse in LGBT partnerships, and help\-seeking processes that survivors follow, **City of Edinburgh Council** committed to ensuring that service redesign provides service pathways specifically for LGBT victims, and for working with LGBT perpetrators, in their 2017 strategy and improvement plan \[ **S6**\]. **Tower Hamlets Council’s** 2016\-19 violence against women and girls strategy draws on Donovan’s research to understand the prevalence of DVA in LGBT relationships, citing her finding that there are similar levels of DVA as in heterosexual relationships. The council uses this evidence to justify targeted activities such as awareness\-raising campaigns at key LGBT events and the appointment of DVA champions to represent LGBT residents \[ **S7**\]. In 2018 Donovan was invited to join the National Scrutiny Panel convened by the **Home Office** to examine current practice in MARACs relating to LGBT victims and survivors of DVA. The resulting guidance and recommendations were written by **SafeLives** with Donovan’s assistance, and were shared with the **Home Office** and the **270 MARACs across England** \[ **S2**\]. SafeLives has confirmed the importance of Donovan’s influence, saying that if policy\-makers did not draw on her work, “ *the experiences and needs of LGBT individuals would not be represented in government policy. Ultimately, this would mean that the needs of LGBT people experiencing DVA would not be met*.” \[ **S2**\] 

###  <ins>Impact on professional training and practice</ins> 

 **Government and non\-governmental bodies** use Donovan’s research to create training for practitioners from across the whole spectrum of professionals involved in DVA, including **Independent Domestic Violence Advisors, police officers, GPs, nurses, social workers, probation officers, teachers, solicitors, and staff from domestic abuse agencies, DVA charities, mental health services, the CPS and CAFCASS**. In the assessment period 4,766 practitioners and professionals in England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland have completed training based on Donovan’s research; this number includes 1,200 Cleveland Police officers and staff \(75% of their workforce\), 398 Durham police officers and staff, and 168 members of Cork Gardai \[ **S2,S3,S8,S9**\]. One Police Inspector who completed this course says that it “ *will make* \[me\] *deal with this area of police business in a different way now. \[…\] I will ensure all my officers under my command deal with this area to the necessary standard and with the necessary sympathy and empathy*” \[ **S9**\]. 98% of the Durham cohort said it had improved their understanding of coercive control \[ **S9**\]. Organisations that have delivered this training confirm that Donovan’s research is a core piece of the evidence used \[S8\], and that “ *as her research has provided a common language for talking about DVA in LGBT relationships, her work is embedded in everything we say*.” \[ **S2**\]. 

 As well as informing training content, the research has been used as evidence of unmet need, enabling organisations to access funding for training. **SafeLives** used Donovan’s research to support successful business cases to fund practitioner training nationally \[ **S2**\] and in 2019 it underpinned the Yorkshire charity **SAYiT’s** successful bid to set up a programme of training and awareness\-raising across South Yorkshire, a programme which has created two new posts delivering training across the region \[ **S1**\]. 

###  <ins>Impact on public representation and discussion</ins> 

 Donovan is advisor to the theatre company **Open Clasp**, a partnership that has resulted in new public representations and discussions of DVA.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders have massive personal and societal cost, but early treatment improves outcomes. In England, specialist NHS early intervention services \(EIS\) were set up in the 2000s to address this but resources were not distributed across the country in a way that matched need. University of Cambridge epidemiological discoveries about how the incidence of psychotic disorders varies with demography underpin  [www.PsyMaptic.org](http://www.psymaptic.org/), a free, population prediction tool that Public Health England \(PHE\) used for its  [https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/) health indicators gazetteer. This was used to implement new policies for early intervention services \(EIS\) that came into effect in 2016.  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) guidance at the time recommended all NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\) should use PsyMaptic predictions to re\-commission EIS, matching resources to the needs of their communities; Professor Jones was appointed clinical lead for implementation of the new NICE standard across NHS England Midlands and East. Access to EIS in England within two weeks of a first psychotic episode has now increased from 33% of patients in 2014 to 76% in 2018/19, exceeding NHS targets of 50%. Updated guidance, published by NICE in 2020 continues to recommend use of PsyMaptic.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Psychosis is one of the most life\-impacting conditions in healthcare. The length of time from onset of psychosis to the provision of evidence\-based treatment has a significant influence on long\-term outcomes. The sooner treatment is started the better the outcome and the lower the overall cost of care. \(Public Health England, Psychosis data report 2016\). 

 Epidemiological research undertaken by Professor Jones and Dr Kirkbride, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge \(Dr Kirkbride is now in the Division of Psychiatry, UCL\), with collaborators from QMUL \(Professor Jeremy Coid\) and KCL \(Professor Craig Morgan & Professor Sir Robin Murray\), defined the existence and determinants of major differences in incidence rates of psychotic disorders across different geographic locations; national average figures are misleading at a local level. They translated this evidence into  [<ins>www.PsyMaptic.org</ins>](http://www.psymaptic.org/), with Dr Kirkbride leading the modelling and site development with Prof Jones. Psymaptic.org is a practical prediction tool for NHS commissioners now adapted by Public Health England into its ‘Fingertips tool’, used to present health data in use throughout the NHS. 

 **Providing evidence of the relationship between psychotic illnesses and demographic and socio\-economic factors** 

 The 2001 NHS Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide \(PIG, p55\) supported the first\-wave commissioning of fifty EIS across England in 2001/2, each EIS serving a population of about 1,000,000 people. The Guide presumed a uniform annual referral rate of 150 new cases per million population such that each team would accumulate a three\-year caseload of around 450 patients. This estimate was based on an international epidemiological study undertaken more than a decade earlier. However, many EIS in London, Birmingham and other urban areas become overwhelmed with much higher numbers of young adults with psychotic illnesses while others, particularly in affluent rural areas, had very few referrals. The commissioning model was not fit for purpose. 

 Reports of high rates in African\-Caribbean communities had already prompted the UK Medical Research Council \(MRC\) to fund the ÆSOP study \(Murray, Jones\). Published in 2006, this examined 1.6 million person\-years in Bristol, London and Nottingham during 1997\-1999 identifying 568 new cases of psychosis; Prof Jones designed the epidemiological components. Analysis in Cambridge \(1\) demonstrated enormous diversity in psychosis incidence according to demographic and socio\-economic factors: age, sex, and study centre accounted for a quarter of the raised rates in black and minority ethnic \(BME\) groups; urban areas had far higher rates than the PIG estimates. A household survey of 33 South London boroughs showed that population density, ethnic density and ethnic fragmentation determined psychosis incidence \(2\). 

 Collaborating with Coid \(QMUL\), the East London first episode psychosis study \(ELFEP; 1996\-2000\) replicated ÆSOP’s epidemiological design and refined the association between incidence and socio\-economic status \(3\), facilitating population prediction. The Wellcome Trust then funded SEPEA \(2009\-2013\), a new epidemiological study based in NHS services and involving 680 cases of incident psychotic illness in rural East Anglia \(Kirkbride with Jones\). Initial prediction models from ÆSOP and ELFEP were found to be applicable beyond urban areas \(4\). 

 **Providing accurate predictions of the incidence of schizophrenia and other psychotic illness in England** 

 Seeing the implications for NHS planning from this emerging work, in 2009 the Department of Health commissioned Prof Jones, Dr Kirkbride and Prof Murray to undertake a systematic review of studies of schizophrenia and other psychotic illness incidence in England since 1950. Their findings \(5\) confirmed that incidence \(1,3\) was heavily determined by socio\-economic context. This prompted Dr Kirkbride and Prof Jones to develop a Bayesian model of the ELFEP data, including spatially structured neighbourhood\-level random effects within characteristics that could be derived from the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) census. Negative binomial regression models estimated risk coefficients across socio\-demographic and socio\-environmental factors, providing a framework for the PsyMaptic prediction tool developed in 2013 \(6\). The coefficients from ÆSOP and ELFEP were applied to the contrasting SEPEA population to predict expected caseloads in NHS EIS, comparing with the observed versus predicted incidence. Counts and 95% prediction intervals from a model with age, sex, ethnicity and population density most precisely predicted observed data at regional, EIS and local authority district levels. Put simply, they tested the model in different ways and  integrated it with neighbourhood\-level data from the ONS census to predict the numbers of people who will develop a psychotic illness anywhere in England. They then checked that the model predictions matched the numbers of psychosis patients the NHS was actually seeing more accurately than the 2001 PIG estimates of 150 cases per 1,000,000 population per year that was being used by the NHS to commission EIS across England. Updated in 2014 on the basis of data from the 2011 England census, the new predictions were used by Public Health England and made available to NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\). 

 The tool was made freely available in 2013 at  [www.PsyMaptic.org](http://www.psymaptic.org/), a process facilitated through work with the NIHR \(National Institute of Health Research\) East of England Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research & Care \(CLAHRC\) for Cambridgeshire & Peterborough.  While this version of PsyMaptic supported the 2016 second\-wave recommissioning of EIS, the tool has been considerably updated led by Dr Kirkbride to accurately predict population need for psychosis care at the small\-area level, taking into account further risk factors such as social fragmentation and cannabis use. This will provide a basis on which to commission new developments in early treatment programmes for psychosis in England up to 2025, available via an open\-access platform \( [https://psymaptic.web.app/](https://psymaptic.web.app/)\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cambridge University’s research contribution provide robust evidence to overturn the orthodox view that the incidence of psychotic illnesses, particularly schizophrenia, shows no variation in relation to geography and demographics. Translation of their findings into the PsyMaptic forecasting tool has had practical impact far beyond this, through being recommended in national guidelines and improving access to treatment for patients. PsyMaptic is directly available to the NHS at all levels and to the public. 

 PsyMaptic was designed to support more sophisticated commissioning decisions, providing predictions of new cases of psychotic illness each year at county, local authority and Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCG\) levels to improve resource allocation and EIS service provision to meet local needs. It has shaped all NHS early intervention services \(EIS\) when they were systematically recommissioned across England in 2016, enabling better service delivery. 

 **Inclusion in commissioning guidelines** 

 The potential influence of PsyMaptic was recognised by public health planning and commissioning teams upon its online publication in 2013. Psymaptic was highlighted as an example of NIHR applied health research translated into practice, in the Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer 2013 \(pub 2014\): *“Opensource models such as*  [*www.psymaptic.org*](http://www.psymaptic.org/) *reveal a more granular picture of need, in this case for early intervention for psychosis in young people. Accounting for demographic variation supports more sophisticated commissioning decisions, resource allocation and service provision to meet local needs.”* \[A\]. 

 The 2015 Guidelines produced by the Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health \(involving the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Royal College of General Practitioners & the Royal Society for Public Health\) included recommendations for the use of PsyMaptic to inform commissioning decisions in the NHS: *""Local number of new \[psychosis\] cases can be estimated at www.psymaptic.org*”\[B\]. 

 **Impact on national recommissioning of Early Intervention Services \(EIS\) in 2016** 

 In 2014, Public Health England incorporated the PsyMaptic predictions into their ‘Fingertips health profiles’, data tools that are used to support commissioning groups in reducing inequalities and improving health and wellbeing\[C\]. CCGs began to use this for planning EIS. 

 In February 2015 the NHS announced its intention to develop a radical new access and waiting time target for EIS with specific standards, meaning that these services required review and recommissioning across England \(NHS England \(2015\): ‘Guidance to support the introduction of access and waiting time standards for mental health services in 2015/16’\). The standard required that, by 1 April 2016, more than 50% of people experiencing a first episode of psychosis would be treated with a NICE approved care package within two weeks of referral. As part of the planning process Prof Jones and Dr Kirkbride were invited onto the NHS England Expert Reference Group for its preparedness programme, and Prof Jones was appointed clinical lead for implementation of the standard by NHS England Midlands and East. 

 In April 2016, NHS England, the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) published detailed guidance on implementing the early intervention in psychosis access and waiting time standard. The guide describes the derivation from PsyMaptic of the Fingertips area\-by\-area estimates of the numbers of people with first\-episode psychosis. In its key considerations for commissioning and service development, the guidance recommends their use of the Fingertips tool as 'step one' in order to understand local demand, underpinning data\-driven commissioning *“Fingertips uses the predictions tool, PsyMaptic, which provides predicted incidence rates for local authority areas. Commissioners should familiarise themselves with the methodology used to produce these predictions, including the confidence levels and caveats that apply*”. An update to the guidance released in December 2020 continues to recommend use of Psymaptic\[D\]. 

 In July 2016, NHS England reported that in order to achieve the NHS target of 50% of patients accessing EIS within 2 weeks, *“Health Education England \(HEE\) will deliver a programme to ensure there are sufficient numbers of appropriately trained staff to deliver the key interventions recommended by NICE, particularly psychological therapy \(cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis\)”*, and that between 2017/18 and 2019/20 this would result in additional investment of GBP61 million \[E\]. All 211 CCGs \(since reorganised into 135 CCGs\) in England have used these tools since December 2016, reporting into the Royal College of Psychiatrists Centre for Care Quality Improvement as part of a survey commissioned by NHS England \[F\]. 

 The forecasts available from PsyMaptic provided the first accurate predictions of the resources required in order to provide EIS according to the NHS gold standards laid out in the 2001 PIG. PsyMaptic began to be used by commissioning groups and NHS England in order to manage EIS activity and monitor workforce requirements. For example, NHS South reported that the data\-driven approach had successfully leveraged more funding for EIS into NHS provider trusts *: “The reports detailed the number of people with psychosis that they were treating as a proportion of the expected incidence from PsyMaptic… in several cases have directly resulted in increased investment in EIP services from CCGs”.* They also noted the accuracy of PsyMaptic models to observed cases *: “PsyMaptic tool closely matching the actual numbers of people with first episode psychosis seen by services with fully functioning EIP teams in our area, and showing a gap in detection of cases in areas where EIP is not fully implemented”* \[G\]. 

 **Impact on patient care** 

 Randomised controlled trials of early interventions demonstrate many benefits for patients with psychotic disorders and their families: symptoms are reduced with fewer relapses and shorter hospitalisations; longer\-term outcomes including employment and quality of life are better than for standard care \[D\]. Matching resource to population needs by the use of the PsyMaptic predictions has made a real difference to patient access to EIS. For instance, its influence on healthcare guidelines has translated into demonstrable impact on patient access to care across the country. Early Intervention in Psychosis \(EIP\) audit data from 2014 showed that 33% of patients with first episode or suspected psychosis were allocated to, and engaged by, an EIP care co\-ordinator within two weeks of referral \(range 4% to 82%\). The 2018/19 Royal College of Psychiatrists’ National Clinical Audit of Psychosis demonstrated the effect of appropriate distribution of EIS; 76% of patients were being treated within two weeks \(range 28% to 100%\), exceeding the NHS England target of 50%, indicating that the new commissioning arrangements are better targeted to population incidence \[H\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Historical masonry buildings often need to be reinforced to make them safe for use and protect them from the threats of natural hazards. Unfortunately, many available reinforcement methods are either ineffective or can cause aesthetic damage to the buildings. Dr Marco Corradi at Northumbria University has created innovative reinforcement techniques that are economical, sustainable, easy to fit, and do not impact negatively on the historical value of the buildings. Dr Corradi’s research has been adopted by three Italian conservation construction companies and deployed in more than 8,650 reinforcement/intervention projects \(2015\-2020\). This has resulted in a significant improvement in the resistance of heritage buildings to seismic action, providing long\-term preservation. These new techniques have also brought significant increases in both turnover and clients for the companies involved, with an overall economic value of approximately EUR30,050,000 \(2015\-2020\), and the creation of 75 full\- and part\-time jobs. Northumbria University research has also enabled the wider conservation industry to use these techniques through continuing professional development, as well as informing \(RILEM and American Concrete Institute\) international guidelines.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Historical buildings are often key cultural assets. They provide economic benefits – most notably via tourism – and social benefits, while also contributing to a community’s social identity. To protect and preserve their historic and cultural importance for the future, structures built from stone or brick \(or other blocks\), and bound by mortar, need restoring and reinforcing to make them stable, safe, and secure in the face of earthquakes and the consequences of climate change \(e.g., coastal erosion, flooding, etc.\), and to endure modern use as residential or commercial buildings. However, ineffective or incorrect retrofitting methods – including the use of materials incompatible with the materials or techniques used to build them originally – have often been applied. To preserve these historical structures, there is a need for innovative and effective engineering solutions that are also economical, sustainable, easy\-to\-fit to existing structures, and compatible with the existing building materials. 

 After joining Northumbria in September 2013, Dr Corradi continued his long\-term collaboration with Professor Antonio Borri and other colleagues from the University of Perugia, Italy \(Corradi left Northumbria in March 2017 and re\-joined in February 2020. This case study only reports on impact from research Corradi carried out while at Northumbria\). Corradi’s methods and techniques on innovative retrofitting and repair techniques for historical masonry are particularly well\-suited for reinforcement against seismic action. Corradi’s research identifies new methods and materials for historical masonry reinforcement, including natural \(stone\) and artificial \(brick\) elements. These methods include Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer \(GFRP\) meshes inside a lime mortar and mortar joints that are repointed using a hydraulic lime/mortar and use of high\-strength stainless steel cords. 

 In 2014, in collaboration with Fibre Net \(an Italian company that designs, engineers, and manufactures products to reinforce existing buildings\), Corradi carried out shear tests \(load parallel to the surface\) on 23 masonry panels, before and after reinforcement. In the tests, stone and brick panels were reinforced by means of both jacketing with GFRP mesh inserted inside the lime mortar, and a reinforced repointing of mortar joints using high\-strength stainless steel cords \[ **R1**\]. The results showed that masonry reinforced with this intervention increased shear strength between 100\-130%, with load capacity also increasing by 60\-400%. Variations were found, depending on local conditions, materials, type of construction, etc. The same reinforcement method was also tested in\-situ, on panels cut from three historical buildings in Italy. The panels strengthened with the GFRP exhibited more than ten\-fold improvement \(1060%\) in lateral load\-carrying capacity when compared to the control panels \[ **R2**\]. A study using numerical modelling also assessed the overall effect on the building over time due to loading, on both the strengthened and unreinforced panels. This modelling confirmed the effectiveness of the intervention and created a tool to support its use in different settings \[ **R2**\]. In 2015, the GFRP reinforcement approach was further investigated by applying it to masonry arches and vaults. Corradi created a new reinforcement technique by combining the traditional Spanish tile vaulting technique \( *tabicada*\) with composite grids inserted into the mortar coating \[ **R3**\]. 

 The results of \[ **R1**\- **R3**\] showed that this specific reinforcement technique \(named Reticulatus\) is a viable solution to the challenge of strengthening and improving seismic resistance for certain types of historical masonry. In 2016, Corradi and collaborators detailed the ‘Reticulatus’ reinforcement system and presented new experimental results for four types of cord reinforcement. These used variable materials and diameters for different types of masonry construction \[ **R4**\]. Using materials and financial support from Fibre Net, results demonstrated increases in shear strength of between 15% and 170%. Historical masonry is normally only able to resist compressive forces, but the application of the Reticulatus technique makes masonry resistant to tensile and shear forces, similar to reinforced concrete \[ **R4**\]. These benefits are achieved with limited negative visual impact. 

 Historically, stone masonry walls were typically made with two ‘leaves’, i.e., inner and outer walls. A strong vertical load over time, or horizontal load via earthquake or flooding, can result in damage. In 2015, Bossong \(an Italian company\) worked with Corradi on the problem of weak connection between wall ‘leaves’ in old buildings. Corradi developed methods to strengthen the connections between weakly\-connected wall leaves using steel rods inserted in a grouted fabric sleeve. Tests conducted on site and in the laboratory showed a 50\-100% improvement achieved by applying transverse connectors to resisting out\-of\-plane action, or to rocking produced by, for example, soil pressure, extreme wind, or earthquakes \[ **R5**\].

 After the 1997\-98 Umbria earthquakes, which caused a significant loss of cultural heritage in Italy, it became clear that new techniques and methods were needed to preserve and maintain the safety of historical buildings. Northumbria’s research has introduced new techniques which meet the demands of conservation organisations and landlords in terms of aesthetics and has resulted in preservation and improved safety of historical buildings. It has also brought economic benefits to conservation engineering companies. ICOMOS \(International Council on Monuments and Sites\) sets stringent conservation requirements for removability of the materials used for reinforcement. Corradi’s interventions offer new economic opportunities for construction companies as the new approaches and products meet these requirements to be reversible, require minimal intervention, and are sustainable. 

 **4.1 Impacts on commerce and the economy – Fibre Net** 

 Fibre Net is an Italian company that designs, engineers, and manufactures materials and systems to reinforce existing buildings and infrastructures for clients in 30 countries. Since 2014, Corradi and collaborators worked with Fibre Net on the Reticulatus method \[ **R4**\], now commercialised under the brand name *RETICOLA* \[ **E1**, **E2**\]. Between 2015 and 2020, the *RETICOLA* product was used by Fibre Net in more than 150 projects, equating to an economic value of **EUR1,650,000** for Fibre Net \[ **E1**\]. 

 Fibre Net also uses other retrofit methods developed by Corradi, including: \(i\) rigid GFRP meshes \[ **R2**, **R4**\] used in their *Ri\-Struttura* and *C\-Matrix* products; and \(ii\) composite\-reinforced masonry ring\-beams \[ **R2**, **R3**\] for avoiding out\-of\-plane collapse of load bearing walls. Between 2015 and 2020, Fibre Net adopted and implemented these methods in approximately 8,500 projects, with an economic value estimated at **EUR27,000,000** \[ **E1**\]. The importance of Corradi’s research is articulated by the Fibre Net CEO, who states, *‘Professor Corradi’s advice, the results of his studies, and our joint experimental activities both at the laboratory and on\-site were critical and important to us. Thanks to this, it was possible to improve our products, to focus on some limitations of the proposed retrofitting methods, to find solutions, and to acquire knowledge’* \[ **E1**\]. 

 The Fibre Net CEO also stated that the collaboration with Corradi contributed significantly to the development of the company. Turnover almost trebled from EUR5,210,000 in 2015 to EUR13,550,000 in 2019 \(an increase of EUR8,340,000 or, equivalently, an increase of 260% compared to the 2015 value\). The number of new clients also increased, by 67%, between 2015 and 2020. In addition, the company’s international influence also grew such that it now sells its products in new countries \[ **E1**\]. In addition, the introduction of Corradi’s methods led to the company creating an additional 75 full\- and part\-time jobs \(headcount: 75\) \[ **E1**\]. 

 **4.2 Impacts on commerce and the economy – Bossong** 

 Bossong is an Italian company that produces fixing systems for the construction industry. In 2015, Bossong adopted Corradi’s work on improving the connection between historical wall leaves using a fixing system \[ **R5**, **E3**\]. Bossong has now deployed this approach to provide a solution to structural problems of historical buildings \[ **E3**\]. The head of Bossong’s Strengthening Department *\(‘Area consolidamento’* in Italian\) confirmed: *‘Professor Corradi, from Northumbria University, has been instrumental in making this possible. He not only advised us where fixing systems could find an application in conservation engineering, but also proposed, studied, and tested a set of technical solutions’* \[ **E3**\]. The value to Bossong of the structural interventions that use Corradi’s methods amounted to an estimated **EUR1,000,000** between 2015 and 2020, and 30% of Bossong’s new client base was attracted specifically to deploy this method \[ **E3**\]. 

 **4.3 Impacts on commerce and the economy – Kimia** 

 Kimia is an Italian company supplying retrofit systems for the construction world. The results of Corradi’s research \[ **R4**\] were used by Kimia in 2016 to commercialise the Reticulatus method under the brand name *Kimisteel*. Kimia worked with Corradi to develop this new product. Building on the advantages of Reticulatus, this product uses composite grids inserted into the mortar coating \[ **E4**\]. The methods were used by Kimia in more than 40 projects between 2016 and 2019 \[ **E5**\]. The Technical Office Manager at Kimia stated: *‘Retrofitting heritage masonry structures with advanced materials has become a very important topic of research and development in the sector, and Kimia has been quick to respond to fill this gap. It would have been difficult for Kimia to develop its commercial activities in this area without the collaboration with Prof. Corradi*… *in the area of retrofit and repair of masonry structures, the value of the output generated by Kimia increased 5% between 2016 and 2019*… *The overall economic value of these projects is estimated to be **EUR400,000**… *We have also seen a 3% increase in clients between these dates due to the new interventions we are able to offer’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.4 Enabling preservation and safety of historic buildings** 

 Northumbria University research \[ **R1**\- **R5**\], via products made by Fibre Net, Bossong, and Kimia, has been deployed on multiple historic and culturally important buildings, preserving them for future generations and preventing the need for resources and energy to be used for new buildings. These include: 

-  Fibre Net’s *RETICOLA* product has been used on several historic buildings \[ **E1**\], including: the mediaeval tower *Pico della Mirandola* \(Modena, Italy, intervention in 2018, a cultural icon that belonged to the Pico family, who reigned over Mirandola from 1311 to 1711\) \[ **E1**\]; and Castello di Compiano \(Reggio Emilia, Italy, intervention in 2015\-2016\), where *RETICOLA* was used to improve the resistance of the north tower to earthquakes by 82% \[ **E1**; **E6A**, p3\] 

-  Fibre Net’s *Ri\-Struttura* and *C\-Matrix* products have been used to improve seismic resistance for listed buildings, palaces and villas, ordinary residences, and educational buildings. For example, *Ri\-Struttura* was used at two schools, one for 230 pupils in Villaverla \(Italy, intervention in 2016\) \[ **E6B**, p5\] and another in Riccione \(Italy, intervention in 2018\) \[ **E6C**, p8\], to improve their resistance to seismic action. The Riccione school occupies a culturally valuable building built in the early 1900s and the intervention has resulted in a 60% seismic improvement of the building, making it safer and more functional \[ **E1**; **E6C**, p8\] 

-  Bossong products, underpinned by Corradi’s research, have been deployed on Palazzo Ardinghelli \(built in 1743 and considered one of the greatest examples of the Baroque in L’Aquila, Italy\) and the aggregate around L'Aquila Cathedral \[ **E3**\] 

-  Kimia products, underpinned by Corradi’s research, have been used on the Castle of Normans \(Ginosa, Italy, a building dating back to the year 1080, intervention in 2017\) \[ **E5**\] 

 **4.5 Developing international capacity to improve building conservation** 

 Fibre Net organises Continuing Personal Development \(CPD\) training for engineers and architects in Italy to detail the various methods of design, installation, and application of the retrofitting solutions \(including those developed as a result of Corradi’s research\). This CPD forms part of the accreditation of engineers and architects in Italy. Between 2015 and 2019, more than 150 training courses in over 80 Italian locations have been delivered by Fibre Net staff, typically attended by 50\-100 professionals each time \[ **E1**\] \(total 7,500\-15,000 professionals\). Fibre Net uses these CPD sessions to explain and propose its own retrofitting solutions, including the *RETICOLA* product, based on Corradi’s research \[ **R4**\]. Fibre Net’s CEO explains: ‘\[RETICOLA products\] *always receive very high interest and attention in the professional community and regularly lead to future clients and projects. Approximately 35% of our new clients are as a result of new methods and advanced material recommendations, studied within the collaboration with Professor Corradi, and given by professionals who have received our CPD*’ \[ **E1**\]. 

 Corradi’s work has also informed international guidelines that advise construction practitioners on how to deploy techniques to preserve and make safe, historical buildings. In construction, international professional bodies promote sustainable and safe construction, with improved performance and cost benefits. They rely on scientific cooperation to produce guidelines to improve construction practices used by structural engineers, conservation engineers, conservation agencies, and architects across the world. As a result of his expertise in historical masonry reinforcement, Corradi was invited to sit on the International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures \(RILEM\)’s Technical Committee \(TC\) 250\-CSM: *Composites for sustainable strengthening of masonry*. Corradi’s research contributed towards a publication containing the GFRP recommendations and guidelines of RILEM TC 250\-CSM, *‘Glass fabric reinforced cementitious matrix: Tensile properties and bond performance on masonry substrate’* published in 2017 \[ **E7**, **E8**\]. The Chair of the TC 250\-CSM committee states: *‘I can really state that the participation of Professor Corradi to this Technical Committee was important and fundamental … the activities of the Technical Committee 250\-CSM can be regarded as a fundamental step for the industry working and/or with the intention to enter the market of masonry retrofit and seismic\-reinforcement’* \[ **E7**\]. 

 In 2016, the decision was made to harmonise the US and European guidelines on the topic, by forming a joint American Concrete Institute \(ACI\)\-RILEM committee. Corradi contributed as co\-author towards these joint US\-European guidelines, published in 2020: ‘ *Guide to design and construction of externally bonded Fabric\-Reinforced Cementitious Matrix \(FRCM\) and Steel\-Reinforced Grout \(SRG\) systems for repair and strengthening masonry structures’* \[ **E7**, **E9**\]. These are the first ACI\-RILEM guidelines that recommend and detail the use of GFRP for retrofit of historical buildings.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In the mid 2000’s, an outbreak of Clostridioides \(previously known as Clostridium\) difficile infection caused hundreds of infections and deaths in the UK. King’s research provided strategies to help combat this disease in Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust \(GSTT\) by improving active case finding and laboratory diagnosis. King’s also evaluated and introduced unique infection control interventions which led to the development and adoption of novel therapeutic approaches referenced in NHS guidance. This has resulted in a significant reduction in all\-cause mortality, infection rates and disease recurrence locally at GSTT and nationally across England. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Emergence of Clostridioides difficile Infection \(CDI\) as a major healthcare associated pathogen.** C difficile produces toxins that damage the colon lining, causing symptoms ranging from mild, self\-limiting diarrhoea to colitis, perforation, sepsis and death. It primarily affects older patients with co\-morbidities, particularly those who have been exposed to antibiotics or those who are immunosuppressed. In the mid 2000’s CDI grew to become one of the most important healthcare associated infections. In 2006 \- 2007 rates of a North American hypervirulent strain were introduced in the UK, with cases increasing to over 55,000 per year and with a case fatality rate of 20\-30% \(14,000 deaths/year\). 

 **King’s research shows C. difficile infections are unrecognised and under\-reported across the NHS \[1\].** In 2011, we focused on improving diagnosis / case detection and found that there was significant under\-recognition of cases reported nationally, as a result of poorly performing diagnostic assays. Our research identified the diagnostic methods being used, finding that 70% were using insensitive methods leading to under diagnosis. Our research demonstrated the superiority of a multistep algorithmic approach incorporating PCR \(Polymerase Chain Reaction\) testing. We showed that earlier, more accurate case finding was key to effective infection control interventions. 

 **King’s demonstrate that disease prevention measures have been highly effective in reducing hospital infections.** In 2015, we evaluated a number of infection control interventions **\[2\]**. We observed that these interventions \(along with improvements in hand hygiene and antimicrobial stewardship\) have resulted in significant reductions in the rate of infection over the last decade. Our collaborative research with five other NHS Trusts also demonstrated the effectiveness of the control measures that we have adopted, showing only 7% of cases could plausibly result from in hospital transmission \(compared with an average of 20% across all hospitals\) **\[3\]**. 

 **King’s show that new treatment approaches using the antibiotic fidaxomicin dramatically improve patient outcomes in CDI.** Our work involving seven NHS Trusts and 1168 patients **\[4\]** has shown how the widespread adoption of a new antibiotic \(fidaxomicin\) to treat CDI has numerous advantages including significantly reduced recurrence rates \(from 16.3 to 3.1%\) and lower all\-cause mortality \(from 17.3 to 6.3%\). It demonstrated that the approach of using fidaxomicin as a first line agent resulted in greater benefit than those Trusts where it was introduced on a more restrictive basis. A further study has also shown that fidaxomicin use is associated with reduced contamination of the hospital environment \(reduction of 20.8%\) **\[2\]**. 

 We participated in a randomized controlled trial of a novel dosing \(extended\-pulsed\) regimen of this drug, which results in improved clinical cure and recurrence rates compared with standard therapies \(reduction of 11%\) **\[5\]**. We also looked at the effect of fidaxomicin in special groups where information on the use this drug is lacking, since these patients were excluded from phase 3 trials. This study **\[5\]** demonstrated the effectiveness of the drug in these poorly studied groups. We have shown the cost effectiveness of this drug in both UK and EU settings using modelling techniques **\[7\]**. In terms of quality\-adjusted life year gain, the higher cost of first line use fidaxomicin compared to vancomycin \(another antibiotic used to treat CDI\) is offset by lower total hospitalisation costs as a result of lower recurrence rates **\[7\]**. 

 **Research by King’s establishes Faecal Microbiota Transplant as an effective therapy for the treatment of recurrent CDI.** Faecal Microbiota Transplant \(FMT\) is a therapeutic strategy to correct the underlying intestinal dysbiosis that is associated with CDI. This involves transferring a consortium of diverse microorganisms from a healthy donor to the gastrointestinal tract of affected patients. It has a success rate of \~90% in patients with multiply recurrent CDI. King’s has shown that this novel treatment is effective therapy for the treatment of CDI **\[6\]** and in 2016, we opened a Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) licenced FMT research facility in CIDR laboratory, one of only two in the UK, which provides material for an increasing number of research studies and patients with recurrent CDI. This facility has enabled us to obtain NIHR grants for randomised controlled trials in novel therapeutic areas \(cirrhosis and antimicrobial resistance\). 

 **King’s research demonstrates the cost effectiveness of treating CDI for the NHS \[8\].** Our research has also examined the financial cost and overall healthcare burden of both initial CDI and recurrent disease to the local healthcare economy. This used micro\-costing methods to estimate fine detail parameters which are often not considered during health economics studies. In partnership with Public Health England and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we used multi\-state modelling to determine the excess length of stay of patients with severe and non\-severe CDI, as well as those with recurrent disease.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The improvements that were made in the clinical management of suspected or confirmed cases of CDI in Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Trust \(GSTT\) resulted from research conducted by King’s academics. This work has been adopted by GSTT and cited in national CDI guidance. This has led to a dramatic and sustained improvement in care for patients with CDI on a local and national level. 

 **King’s algorithm led to improvement in diagnosis and detection of cases locally and nationally.** Accurate and timely laboratory diagnosis is critical to allowing any infection control interventions to be implemented. In 2010, GSTT introduced a new testing algorithm developed by King’s **\[1\]** that was able to more accurately \(increased sensitivity and specificity\) identify cases **\[A.1\]**. The Trust also implemented better infection control interventions based on King’s research **\[2, 3\]** including rapid isolation, adherence to personal protective equipment and improving hand hygiene; enhanced methods of environmental decontamination \(including novel technologies such as sporicidal cleaning agents and automated cleaning technologies using vaporised hydrogen peroxide and UV light\) **\[A\]**. This led to dramatic reduction in cases, hospital spread, rate of infection, in\-hospital transmission and environmental contamination of the hospital environment. The Site General Manager at GSTT confirmed that the system has steadily helped to reduce the spread of infections, particularly CDI at GSTT **\[A.2\]**. 

 Since 2007, PHE has carried out mandatory enhanced surveillance of CDI for NHS acute trusts, which includes GSTT. When the annual report was first introduced, GSTT had a hospital\-onset CDI rate of 40.5 cases/100,000 Occupied Bed Days \(OBDs\). By the beginning of the impact assessment period this had already decreased to 13.5/100,000 OBDs and in 2019/2020 the rate decreased even further to 7.0 **\[B.1\]**. 

|#  2013/14 |#  2014/15 |#  2015/16 |#  2016/17 |#  2017/18 |#  2018/19 |#  2019/20 |

| 13.5 | 15.8 | 15.4 | 11.2 | 7.8 | 6.3 | 7.0 |

#  Source \[B.1\] 

 This has resulted in GSTT achieving the lowest CDI rate in the Shelford Group \(of 10 leading academic NHS organisations\), a position which it has held for the past three financial years. This rate is almost half that of the next best performing Shelford Group Trust \(Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, with a rate of 15.2 cases/100,000 OBDs\) **\[B.1\].** This is further confirmed by GSTT’s Joint Director of Infection Prevention and Control **\[A.1\]:** “King’s research has significantly influenced hospital policy on control of this infection in the Trust. The introduction of many of the strategies outlined in King’s research has enabled rates of infection to be reduced to one of the lowest of any comparable NHS Trust *.*” 

 In March 2012, the Department of Health published updated guidance on the diagnosis and reporting of CDI **\[B.2\]** referencing King’s research **\[1\].** When this national guidance was published, the hospital\-onset CDI rate in England was 17.3/100,000 OBDs, by 2019/20 this had reduced to 13.6 **\[B.1\]**. The current protocol for testing and diagnosing remains unchanged and it’s based on the peer\-reviewed, published research which includes King’s work **\[1\]** as outlined on an NHS Improvement 2019/20 document on CDI objectives for NHS organisations **\[B.3\]**. 

 **King’s research on fidaxomicin contributed to the growing evidence that it reduces recurrence rates and lowers mortality and provides cost savings for the treatment of potentially fatal CDI.** Fidaxomicin **\(FDX\)** was approved for use in the UK in 2012. It is one of the only four drugs approved for CDI treatment. That same year, GSTT became one of the first hospitals in the country to routinely use this new drug for the treatment of adults. King’s research **\[4\]** showed that within the 1168 patients treated, there was a significant reduction in recurrence rates \(from 16.3 to 3.1%\) and lower all\-cause mortality \(from 17.3 to 6.3%\). This was the first and only real\-world evaluation of available antibiotics for CDI in the UK, that confirmed that first\-line use of fidaxomicin could improve clinical outcomes in the treatment and management of CDI and its associated recurrences, resulting in an overall cost saving **\[4\]**. 

 This work was awarded the Prix Galien award for Real World Evidence in 2016 **\[C\]**. Worldwide, the Prix Galien is regarded as the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in biopharmaceutical and medical technology research. Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of the UK Prix Galien judging panel, said: “A unique series of local service evaluations were conducted in 2013\-2014 to evaluate the impact of Dificlir \[trade name for fidaxomicin\] introduction on the NHS. The evaluation, studied in real\-world settings, included investigating its effects on service delivery, the management of CDI and its costs, primarily to inform local decision\-making. Results indicated the very significant contribution that Dificlir’s use can make to tackling the major public health problems of antimicrobial resistance through targeted antibiotic therapy and infection control **\[C.2\]**.” 

 Additionally, our work demonstrating the clinical benefits of using FDX **\[4\]** as well as its cost effectiveness **\[5,7,8\]**, has enabled its inclusion in the list of NHS England high\-cost drugs **\[D\]**. Drugs on this list are centrally funded by NHS England, which means it doesn’t come as a cost to individual NHS Trusts, thus making it more accessible for them to use. 

 **Methods to combat CDI were further validated by King’s research.** After GSTT introduced King’s algorithm and FDX, an analysis **\[3\]** was conducted to verify the effectiveness of these measures in comparison with other NHS Trusts \(Leeds Teaching Hospitals, Calderdale and Huddersfield, City Hospitals Sunderland, St. Helens and Knowsley Teaching Hospitals and Great Western Hospitals\). The data ranging from June 2013 to August 2014, revealed a low rate of in\-hospital transmission at GSTT; only 7% of isolates could be potentially linked to a previous case at GSTT, compared with an average of 20% at the other NHS hospitals \(range 7\-24%\) **\[3\]**. 

 **King’s research enabled expansion of FMT services with a regulated and licensed manufacturing facility.** Although the initial treatment with anti\-C. difficile antibiotics is generally effective, a significant proportion of patients \(20\-30%\) suffer recurrent infection, which is associated with a disrupted/less diverse gut microbiota. Newer methods of manipulating the gut microbiota such **Faecal Microbiota Transplant \(FMT\)** are key to improving clinical outcomes. King’s research provided the evidence base **\[6\] \[E\]** for FMT to be introduced at GSTT in 2014. 

 In 2016, the success of FMT led to the creation of an MHRA licensed stool bank which has been used to treat over 250 patients from Guys and St Thomas. Owing to the current complexity of establishing an MHRA\-accredited service for FMT, GSTT has become a centre of referral for other NHS providers in South East England with CDI and Ulcerative Colitis. This is one of only two licensed facilities in England and has facilitated two successful NIHR grant applications for randomised controlled trials of FMT in cirrhosis **\[F.1\]** and antibiotic resistant organisms **\[F.2\]**. Clinical success rates for patients treated with FMT have been over 95% and have improved quality of life as outlined in a patient’s testimonial **\[F.3\]**: “I have a Primary Immunodeficiency and get virtually continuous urinary infections and frequent chest infections, all requiring a large number of antibiotics. Several times I have ended up with CDI, a difficult and dangerous gut infection as a side effect of the antibiotics. These have been treated with vancomycin and metronidazole sadly without effect on both occasions. I was left wondering if I was going to die of this. I spent a considerable effort trying to locate someone doing faecal transplants and fortunately eventually found Dr Goldenberg at Guys and St Thomas’ NHS trust in 2018.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Most historic burial monuments have at best had only inscriptions recorded, and these are rarely archived. Very few have their archaeological attributes recorded, despite being important heritage assets that are deteriorating through erosion and mismanagement, with many threatened by church redundancy and reuse. Mytum’s research has highlighted the above\- and below\-ground archaeological potential of historic burial grounds and has provided updated data recording and, for the first time, systems for archiving and analysis to enable effective monument recording.  Mytum’s historic mortuary archaeology research \(coffins and fittings and memorials\) has led to changes in professional practice by heritage practitioners, Diocesan Advisory Committees, and community groups. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Mytum has researched burial grounds and their memorials throughout the period, conducting primary fieldwork in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Australia \[3.1, 3.2\]. The research demonstrates the changes in style and materials of commemorative monuments in graveyards and cemeteries over time and over space at the scale of the burial ground, the region, nationally, and internationally. It explores issues of identity and religion, development of production workshops and the shift from craft to mass production, and the ways in which the formalisation of burial grounds with coffins, vaults and memorials formed part of the improvement mentality of the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Through a combination of detailed contextual studies and wider comparative analyses using data from several countries and indeed globally, Mytum has brought insights from mortuary data to current research themes in historic and post\-medieval archaeology. 

 Research into coffins and their fittings, mortsafes for body protection and comparing coffin decoration with that of memorials, led to a co\-edited volume with 4 chapters by Mytum as sole or co\-author \[3.4\]. This volume considers for the first time the development of historic coffins and fittings within an international comparative context and is the first substantial publication on historic below\-ground mortuary material culture beyond the single\-site monograph, involving the leading researchers in the UK, USA and Australia \[3.4\]. Mytum also led the development of Reflectance Transformation Imaging \(RTI\) in graveyard recording and other historical archaeology artefact categories \[3.5\]. This method of merging numerous photographs with different lighting direction allows the creation of an interactive image that enhances identification of text, imagery and carving techniques. Use of RTI can remove the need for the taking of potentially damaging rubbings of memorials. 

 Mytum also extended his activity into applied research, successfully winning the competitive bid within the Cemeteries and Churchyards in section 4D2 of the National Heritage Protection Plan 2011\-2015 \[5.1\]. In this Historic England project, Mytum evaluated the status of physical and digital burial ground recording and their integration within Historic Environment Records \(HERs\) across England \(project 6358\). This research identified the limitations of previous recording and the lack of archived records, particularly digital sources, and proposed policies to improve archiving and access \[3.6\]. This led Historic England to fund a further project  Discovering England’s Burial Spaces \(DEBS\): Enabling new forms of community engagement through digital experience \(Historic England project 7533, via University of York\), *“DEBS is a direct response to Mytum et al’s EH 6358 report”* \[5.2A, p.4\] with Mytum as the team member to develop an enhanced recording system for burial ground monument and landscape recording and analysis \[3.3\] and, collaboratively, a digital archiving system through the Archaeology Data Service. The system enables new data to be entered and archived, but also the updating and entry of legacy data from previous surveys.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Mytum’s research, and in particular the Discovering England’s Burial Spaces \(DEBS\) methodology \[3.3\], has led to significant changes in heritage policy and practice by national organisations and regional authorities with responsibility for the protection of burial grounds. Mytum’s methods of recording and analysing burial grounds have also been adopted by major commercial archaeology units for large\-scale excavation projects in England \[3.3, 3.4\]. By working with local community groups and charities, Mytum’s research has helped to change the way in which communities appreciate and care for their local heritage. 

 National and regional policy and practice 

 Mytum’s recording system \[3.3\] has been adopted by the Advisory Panel on the Archaeology of Burials in England \(Historic England and the Church of England\) in providing *“comprehensive guidelines covering treatment of human remains and associated artefacts and grave markers”* \[5.2C,1\], notably *“Dealing with gravestones”* \[5.2C,39\]. The Church of England Head of Church Buildings Strategy states that Mytum’s system *“for the CBA and with support from the DEBS project for recording burial monuments in churchyards has been adopted by the Church of England as the national professional standard”* \[5.2D, 3.3\]. This is applied by all Diocesan Advisory Committees \(DACs\), local authorities and field archaeologists. The British Association of Biological Anthropology and Osteoarchaeology recommends Mytum’s methodology \[3.3\] for recording non\-skeletal funerary remains: *“Mytum’s publications have been invaluable to us in the creation of these professional standards”* \[5.2C, 3.3, 3.4\]. 

 Mytum’s recording system \[3.3\] is now accepted practice by numerous regional organisations. For example, the Derby \(DAC\) and Peak District National Park Authority Archaeologist advises the use of Mytum’s methodology for graveyard projects in the Peak District \[5.3B\]. The County Durham HER Officer notes that the methodology is used as *“standard”* in Planning Conditions \[5.3B\], and that DEBS will be used to archive legacy data from previous graveyard recording projects \[5.3A\]. The Secretary of York DAC notes that Mytum’s recording methods are now standard policy “ *in all cases where archaeological implications of any changes are identified”* \[5.3A\], so contractors must ensure that *“coffin fittings are recorded alongside human remains, that memorials are suitably recorded before movement, and that conservation works are fit for purpose”* \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]. With approximately 20 applications per year, this has protected heritage assets including coffins and gravestones that otherwise would have degraded or been damaged through incorrect management, including several examples identified by the York DAC Church Buildings Advisor \[5.3B\]. 

 Commercial archaeology 

 There are 2 multi\-million\-pound excavation and conservation projects currently taking place at Hull Holy Trinity burial ground and at Hull Minster. York DAC Church Buildings Advisor notes that, *“In both these projects memorials and below\-ground burial archaeology have been significant considerations in the design and implementation of works, and Harold Mytum’s research experience has enabled him to recommend modifications to both archaeological briefs and the Written Statements of Investigation \(WSI\) required for excavation and memorial recording which were adopted by the DAC, form part of the approval conditions, and are implemented by the contractors”* \[5.3B\]. 

 The Senior Project Manager for the Holy Trinity excavations states: “ *Mytum's research has been influential not only on our systems for surveying and recording the burial monuments and coffin remains, but also in the manner that we propose to interpret the full suite of archaeological remains*” \[5.6B, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4\]. The Head of Heritage Burial Services at major archaeological unit Oxford Archaeology notes that “ *An important part of this work is your research \[noting 3.3, 3.4\]. This research enables us to analyse and interpret our data more effectively. In fact, it is the industry standard for the work we do*” \[5.6A, 3.3\]. 

 The Operations and Volunteer Assistant at the Coffin Works, Birmingham, states this “ *is a time capsule museum preserving the Newman Brothers coffin furniture manufactory \[and\] Harold Mytum’s chapters \[in 3.4\] … are a really valuable resource … and were used by myself and other members of the team for research and volunteer training*” \[5.6C\]. 

 Community heritage: managing and preserving graveyards 

 Caring for God’s Acre \(CfGA\) is a national charity supporting people to investigate, care for, and enjoy burial grounds \( [www.caringforgodsacre.org.uk/about\-us](http://www.caringforgodsacre.org.uk/about-us)\) \[5.5B\]. The CfGA Director notes a change in CfGA policy due to Mytum’s research: *“you discussing cultural history… has been really influential”*, and *“we now include volunteer activities around monument recording.”* \[5.5C, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3\] Mytum provided downloadable resources for recording for CfGA the website \[5.5A, 3.3\], and CfGA used Mytum’s research in *The Beautiful Burial Ground* DVD for community groups planning churchyard management and recording \[5.5A\]. Through CfGA and HLF, Mytum led regional workshops on graveyard recording and management methods in Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Oxfordshire, Yorkshire, Limerick \(Ireland\), Enniskillen \(Northern Ireland\), Cardiff, and Bangor \(Wales\) \[5.5B\]. Mytum’s research and methodology \[3.3\], now promoted by CfGA, improves recording methods, increases the level of detail recorded, and enables permanently archived results with the DEBS system. 

 Mytum’s recording methodology \[3.3\] has already been employed by several community groups. CfGA leads *“a heritage recording project in Birmingham \(involving 5 cemeteries and funded by Historic England\) inspired by your work”* \[5.5B, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5\]. Derby DAC Archaeological Advisor and Peaks National Park Archaeologist has “ *used it several times as a professional and with various community groups, Young Archaeologists’ Clubs \(YAC\) etc.”* \[5.4, 3.3\]. Leavesden Hospital History Association applied the methodology to *“record 510 cremation markers and 30 monument headstones”*, capturing data that had been lost for 60 years *""due to many previous cemetery records being lost or destroyed over time""* \[5.8A, 3.3\]. Embsay\-with\-Eastby Historical Research Group used it to survey 4 churchyards in the Yorkshire Dales and *“promoted Harold’s approach to several other local community groups, encouraging them to adopt his model of gravestone analysis, and take their local studies beyond the simple collection of memorial inscriptions”* \[5.8B, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5\]. Meanwhile, the Spirit of Sutterby HLF project \(Lincolnshire\) has *“already compiled the first draft of the Sutterby gravestones document”* \[5.7C\]. By using Mytum’s methodology \[3.3\], these community organisations not only record their local heritage in greater detail than before, but can permanently add their records to the national archives through the DEBS system. 

 Using Mytum’s research methods \[3.3\] has led to greater community involvement in heritage. The Slingsby HLF report notes that recorders gained *“new knowledge, new skills, new connections”*, and *“began to swap stories about ‘their’ stone, sharing discoveries and stories that led to other conversations not just about history, but also village life today”* \[5.7\]. Slingsby Local History Group observed this was a *“good way of getting church and non\-church people to meet and reminding everyone in the village that the churchyard belongs to them”* \[5.8\].1,500 positive social media comments attest to the important role of the Leavesden Hospital survey to *""regenerate and restore this important part of local history for our community to remember and cherish""* \[5.8A\]. One Embsay\-with\-Eastby survey participant said *“I will never look at gravestones in the same way again. I only ever looked at what the inscriptions said”* \[5.8\]. 

 Particular contribution of the submitted unit's research and acknowledgement of other key research contributions: 

 The DEBS project: digital input, initial community training \(T.Pillatt,  N.Beale, University of York\). Mytum created the recording protocols and the data spreadsheets to be converted to an on\-line format by T.Pillatt. Mytum contributed to community training, provided case study exemplars, and wrote all advice materials for project planning and survey.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Aditya Jain’s research on managing work organisation \(psychosocial risks\) to promote employee well\-being and organisational performance has informed the development of policy initiatives in Europe and internationally. These developments are underpinned by research that culminated in the development of the European Framework for Psychosocial Risk Management \(PRIMA\-EF\), and outputs of subsequent research projects have been adopted by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) and the European Commission. This has led to the development of policy initiatives by government regulators in Ireland and Italy, development of national standards in the UK, Canada, Denmark, and ongoing development of an International Standardisation Organisation \(ISO\) standard. This has resulted in direct impacts on policy at the organisational level which has led to the promotion of employee wellbeing and a positive work environment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The negative health and economic impacts of psychosocial risks at work are well established. These risks, which include harassment and bullying at work impacts both employees and organisations through the consequences of work\-related stress and poor mental health. Work\-related stress has been estimated to account for 37% of all work\-related ill health and 45% of all working days lost due to ill health in the United Kingdom \(UK\). It affects 1 in 4 European workers with an estimated cost of 3\-4% of GDP in the EU. Psychosocial risks and work\-related stress have also been shown to impact negatively on worker health and well\-being as well as on organisational innovation and productivity **\[5,6\]**. 

 **What is PRIMA\-EF?** 

 Having highlighted work\-related stress as a major challenge for occupational health and safety, Dr Jain at  Nottingham University Business School and Professor Leka at the Centre for Organisational Health and Development, University of Nottingham, a World Health Organization \(WHO\) Collaborating Centre in Occupational Health, conducted research which led to the development of the  [European Framework for Psychosocial Risk Management \(PRIMA\-EF\)](http://www.prima-ef.org/), a best practice framework for the management of psychosocial risks in the workplace, which was launched in 2008. This framework aims to reduce work\-related psychosocial risk by providing key indicators, interventions and guidance to promote best practice for employers and policy\-makers. The policy research that informed the development of PRIMA\-EF has been supported by various bodies and to date has received funding in excess of EUR1,500,000 **\[G1\-G6\]**. The origins of the work lie in research on the management of psychosocial risks and work\-related stress that was funded by the European Commission \(2006\-2009\). PRIMA\-EF is part of the WHO’s Healthy Workplaces Framework, which is a global initiative to promote and create enabling environments for healthy behaviours among workers and was incorporated into WHO global guidance in 2008. 

 **Research leading to the development of PRIMA\-EF** 

 PRIMA\-EF was an extensive interdisciplinary project, involving several studies including a comprehensive review of policy level interventions for psychosocial risk management in the workplace **\[1\]**, stakeholder interviews and social partner \(employers’ associations and trade unions\) surveys and expert workshops to investigate current knowledge among European stakeholders of regulation on psychosocial risk factors **\[2\]** and business benefits on managing psychosocial risks **\[3\]**. This body of research concluded that a gap between policy and practice existed and further regulatory and voluntary policy initiatives were needed to bridge this gap **\[1,4\]**. It was also noted that psychosocial risk management at work could improve organisational performance **\[3,4\]**. This research culminated in the development of PRIMA\-EF which includes key indicators, interventions and guidance on psychosocial risk management to promote good practices among enterprises and policymakers and to benchmark standards across companies, sectors and countries. 

 **Research after the development of PRIMA\-EF** 

 Further studies using policy analysis and evaluation were used to review European best practice approaches in psychosocial risk management. A review of voluntary standards on occupational health highlighted a lack of specific guidance on preventing stress and psychosocial risks in the workplace within European Union member states **\[5\].** On the basis of this review, Jain and Leka subsequently presented the case for fostering responsible organisational practices by developing a voluntary standard for psychosocial risk management. They authored and led the development of the first standard for the management of psychosocial risks in the workplace in 2011 for the British Standards Institution \(BSI\) **,** known as the Publicly Available Specification 1010 \(PAS1010\) **\[4\].** Further research demonstrated that poor psychosocial risk management acts as a barrier to innovation at an organisational, country and EU level, highlighting the importance of psychosocial risk management for EU\-wide innovation performance **\[6\].** In 2014, Jain investigated the effect of psychosocial risks in a Norwegian Oil and Gas company, which adopted the PRIMA\-EF framework and adhered to good practice according to PAS1010 **\[7\].** This study used a psychosocial risk indicator \(PRI\) to demonstrate that a poorer psychosocial environment was associated with hydrocarbon leaks and, therefore, the importance of psychosocial risk management not only for health and wellbeing but also for safety.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Pathways to impact through World Health Organisation** 

 PRIMA\-EF guidelines were developed through a series of consultations and workshops with key stakeholders and were subsequently incorporated into WHO global guidance in 2008 **\[A\]**. PRIMA\-EF was widely disseminated through activities promoted by WHO and included into the Global Plan of Action on Workers’ Health for the period 2008\-17, which was adopted unanimously by 193 WHO Member States **\[A, B\]**. As a result, policy makers in all WHO regions have been using the best practice framework to tackle psychosocial risks and develop healthy workplaces. Since 2009, Jain’s research **\[4\]** has contributed to the development of ‘a number of BSI/ISO standards’ including PAS1010 \( *Guidelines for the management of psychosocial risks*\) which was published by the British Standards in 2011 and informed the development of the Canadian National Standard for psychological health and safety in the workplace in January 2013 **\[D\].** 

 **Influencing international guidance, policy and standards** 

 In 2014, the translation of PRIMA\-EF into the Canadian National Standard led to the implementation of psychosocial risk management strategies across Canadian organisations **\[D\]**. In a case study research project \(2014\-2017\), 40 organisations were reviewed to evaluate subsequent implementation of the Standard **\[E\]**. Uptake of psychosocial risk management strategies within organisations increased from 55% in 2014 to 72% in 2017 as a result of the Standard \[E\]. To enact the Standard, Canadian organisations implemented workplace policies to protect against psychosocial risks, enhanced employee mental health knowledge, and conducted mental health training for managers. The Nova Scotia Health Authority with a workforce of more than 40,000 members incorporated the Canadian Standard into their operations, by improving data collection methods and increasing supportive practices to improve psychosocial health and safety **\[E\]**. Another participating organisation stated that ‘implementing \[the Standard\] has helped us keep mental health top of mind in everything we do. It is no longer an afterthought. It is now woven into all our considerations and decisions. It is now just how we operate’ **\[E\]**. 

 Jain has further clarified key legislation by developing the ‘Interpretative Document of the Implementation of Council Directive 89/391/EEC in relation to Mental Health in the Workplace’ which was published by the European Commission in 2014 and promoted by the European Agency for Safety & Health at Work **\[C\]**. Additionally, PRIMA\-EF work, specifically the 2008 WHO global guidance, and Jain’s EU consensus paper on mental health in the workplace were promoted by WHO on the 2017 mental health day, which was dedicated to mental health in the workplace, through the WHO’s Mental health in the workplace information sheet **\[A\]**. 

 The body of research behind PRIMA\-EF and the various guidelines, documents and standards it has informed, has raised awareness of the importance of management of psychosocial risks in the workplace and laid the foundation for a joint proposal by BSI and the Standards Council of Canada to be put to the International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\), in 2018, to develop an international guidance standard. The proposal was approved and led to the establishment of a working group responsible for developing the new standard; ISO 45003 *Psychological health and safety at work: Guidelines for managing psychosocial risks* **\[D\]**. Jain is a member of this working group, and chair of the UK BSI mirror committee contributing to this work. The international standard, which will be the first international standard dealing with psychological health and safety in the workplace, is expected to be launched in 2021 **\[D\]**. 

 **Impact in Europe** 

 Jain’s research and standardization work has also informed the development of a new psychosocial risk management standard in Denmark **\[F\]**. PAS1010 and the agreed development of ISO45003 provided a platform for the establishment of the Danish national standard in 2017. Representatives from the National Standardisation body stated ‘PAS1010 and the research carried out by \[Jain\] have been used as an essential basis and starting point as well as great inspiration for the specific political decisions and research initiatives’ **\[F\].** Policy initiatives formed include targets to reduce proportion of employees who are mentally overloaded by 20% by the end of 2020 across all Danish organisations, compared with 2011 figures. 

 PRIMA\-EF has also been used to develop policies and tools in Ireland. In 2018, the Irish Health and Safety Authority \(HSA\) launched the ‘Work Positive CI’ online tool to help companies manage work\-related stress and improve employees’ well\-being **\[G\]**. PRIMA\-EF has fundamentally informed the development of the Irish Work Positive approach, with the website stating that The Work Positive process ‘is aligned with the Psychosocial Risk Management European Framework \(PRIMA\-EF\)’ **\[G\]**. A testimonial from HSA further testifies to the significance of Jain’s research on the Work Positive tool ‘which is aligned with PRIMA\-EF and is a key indicator that has been used to evaluate both policy and practice’ **\[G\]**. The tool is, according to HSA, ‘the only state\-backed freely available online tool for carrying out psychosocial risk audits in companies based in the Republic of Ireland’ which has been used ‘by The Irish Prison Service, the Ambulance Service, the Red Cross and the Irish Emergency Ambulance Service’ and ‘has been embraced across the Pharmaceutical sector’ **\[G\]**. Furthermore, ‘over 5000 registrations have occurred for the tool since going online’ and has been used by HSA internally ‘to great effect and it is an embedded part of the health, safety and wellbeing toolkit.’ In summary, the PRIMA\-EF model, based on Jain’s research, and the Work Positive tool, ‘has resulted in a high impact in Ireland, both in terms of awareness of the system, and its operation as a survey tool and follow up systematic approach to control measures’ **\[G\]**. 

 Jain’s research has also led to a partnership with PRIMA\-EF collaborators from Italy to develop an Italian approach to address psychosocial risks in the workplace and develop key initiatives that have been implemented for the management of industrial psychosocial risks. This approach was informed by PRIMA\-EF and employed across Italy through the National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work \(INAIL\) who have testified to ‘the significant impact and contribution of the work of … Jain in developing and implementing methods and tools to assess and manage psychosocial risks at work in Italy’ **\[H\]**. According to INAIL, PRIMA\-EF was ‘particularly influential to the development of a participatory approach to the management of psychosocial risks in the workplace in Italy’ which led to ‘a national project financed by the Italian Ministry of Health \(2013\-2016\) about the monitoring of psychosocial risks management among Italian enterprises’ **\[H\]**. In 2017, this project evolved to ‘update and improve … INAIL’s methodology’ which now ‘represents the most used method to assess and manage psychosocial risks’ by Italian enterprises and, ‘in October 2020, more than 8,000 enterprises resulted registered into INAIL’s web platform and 180,000 questionnaires filled in’ **\[H\]**. Furthermore, the Italian approach was evaluated in 2014 and was found to result in better psychosocial risk management in Italian organisations. As a result of the policy, the number of Italian companies creating provisions and adopting procedures to deal with work\-related stress more than doubled **\[H\]**. Moreover, provisions for bullying, harassment, and violence at work more than tripled in companies in 2014, in comparison to before the policy in 2009. The use of procedures to deal with work\-related stress in Italy was reported to be higher than the EU average **\[H\]**. 

 **Impact in Australia** 

 In Australia, ‘the development, implementation, and evaluation of the PRIMA\-EF guidelines were influential to the development of the Australian Workplace Barometer \[AWB\] and, in particular, to the application of its outcomes’ **\[I\]**. The AWB, which has been informing policies and practices since 2009, is a representative employee survey that provides an overview of working conditions across Australia for follow\-up and is being promoted by SafeWork Australia **\[I\]**. The scientific lead of the AWB has stated that ‘PRIMA\-EF guidelines supported the practical applications of the PSC \[Psychosocial Safety Climate\]’, which is a key indicator that has been used to evaluate both policy and practice in Australia, for example ‘across the public sector in the state of Victoria \(over 100,000 employees\)’ **\[I\]**. The scientific lead also states that PSC evidence has been used by ‘the Australian Productivity Commission, which provides independent research and advice to the government, in their November 2020 report on Mental Health, included a full page on the Psychosocial Safety Climate theory and evidence to recommend significant changes in codes of practice and to national law: “… Governments should amend Workplace Health and Safety arrangements in their jurisdiction to make psychological health and safety as important in the workplace as physical health and safety. \(Action 7.1\)”’ **\[I\]**. Additionally, the scientific lead’s testimonial to the influence of Jain’s research on the AWB has also stated that ‘expertise in conducting the AWB has been translated to advice for international researchers and policy makers, informing the development of the New Zealand Workplace Barometer and Norway’s national surveillance system’ **\[I\]**. 

 **Impact on employee wellbeing and organisational performance** 

 Finally, the work carried out by Jain in PRIMA\-EF and subsequent projects **\[G4, G5\]** has had further direct impact at the company level. The HR leader for Equinor ASA \(formerly known as Statoil\) states that the organisation collaborated with Jain to develop their own psychosocial risk management framework and that they adhere to good practice according to PAS1010, which was informed by Jain’s research **\[J\]**. Since the application of PRIMA\-EF, in 2013, the company decided to develop a Psychosocial Risk Indicator \(PRI\) to guide management ‘in prioritising risk areas with appropriate follow\-up measures’ **\[J\]**. In 2020, the PRI was revised and is used as part of their annual employee survey with results ‘followed up with Psychosocial risk management tools embedded in the company’s Health and Safety Toolbox’ **\[J\]**. Equinor’s HR lead’s 2020 testimonial summarises that ‘quantitative and qualitative risk data collected through the PRIMA method over the past years have helped us identify the psychosocial factors that are particularly important for us as a company when we manage psychosocial risk to promote health and well\-being among our employees, and have also highlighted the link between psychosocial risks and safety performance \(hydrocarbon leaks\). This work has not only benefitted us as a company in promoting employee wellbeing and a positive work environment but also helped improve organisational performance’ **\[J\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Davey, Newport and Deribe at the Centre for Global Health Research \(CGHR\), Sussex, has provided important evidence – including detailed podoconiosis \(podo\) mapping – which has informed the Ethiopian and Rwandan Governments’ agendas on podo control, prevention and treatment. In partnership with the Ethiopian government and national NGOs, the Sussex team contributed to the implementation of podo care management initiatives in the most endemic areas, which resulted in the treatment of 70,000 podo patients \(approximately 5% of the national total\) and the training of over 500 health workers to identify and treat podo cases. The CGHR team has also led the first trial of a simple, inexpensive foot care package in reducing podo\-related acute inflammatory episodes in Ethiopia. This care package is now included in the WHO Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases \(NTDs\) training package for health workers, in the Rwanda NTD Master Plan 2019\-2024 and in the Ethiopia NTD Master Plan 2020\-2025. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Podoconiosis \(hereafter referred to as podo\) is a non\-infectious disease arising in barefoot individuals who are in long\-term contact with irritant red clay soil of volcanic origin. Major symptoms include swelling of the lower limb \(lymphoedema\) and acute painful attacks. The disease has major social and economic consequences through stigma and loss of productivity. Globally, there are around four million people with podo, mainly in tropical Africa, Central and South America, and Southeast Asia. As recently as 2010, the condition was not mentioned in the health policy of any of the 32 endemic countries, so no patient was able to receive treatment. Since 2005, staff from the Centre for Global Health Research \(CGHR\) at Sussex have been conducting wide\-ranging research to address some of the most urgent knowledge gaps, particularly around disease distribution, mental health consequences and management. This case study focuses on the research most immediately relevant to national and global elimination of podo. The research described is unique and distinctive; the team has contributed more than 95% of the articles on podo published in the past decade. 

 CGHR acts as the research hub for a unique global NGO advocacy for podo, Foot *work* \( [https://podo.org](https://podo.org/)\) for which Davey is the Executive Director. All the research referenced in Section 3 was supported by grants awarded to the Sussex team at the CGHR and delivered in partnership with academics and non\-academic collaborators based in the UK and overseas \(mainly Ethiopia and Rwanda\). Amongst the research stakeholders were representatives from the targeted countries’ Health Ministries, as well as NGOs active in the delivery of podo prevention and care programmes. 

###  **Understanding the distribution of podo** 

 Reliable and detailed data on the prevalence and distribution of podo globally are scarce. In many endemic countries, podo is confused with Lymphatic Filariasis \(LF\), another condition manifested by leg swelling but with a different cause \(parasites transmitted by mosquitos\). Estimating the number of people with podo according to geographical location is important for programme planners and health care providers, who plan, monitor and evaluate control and elimination efforts. This need was addressed by CGHR research through the production of a comprehensive mapping of podo distribution and prevalence \[ **R1; G1, G3**\]. Between June and September 2013, the team, in collaboration with the Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health, generated the first nationwide integrated mapping of podo and LF in Ethiopia. By combining nationwide survey data with spatially referenced information on a range of environmental factors, the CGHR team identified human and environmental risk factors for podo and the endemic districts requiring prioritised intervention. In 2017, the research team used a geostatistical modelling approach on the nationwide mapping data \[ **R1; G1, G3**\] to estimate the number of podo cases \[ **R2; G1, G2**\]. The analysis gave an estimate of 1,537,963 podo cases in Ethiopia in 2015, with 99% of the cases being in remote parts of the three largest Regional States. This analysis also provided a framework for modelling the distribution of podo in other endemic countries, such as Rwanda. Nationwide mapping in Rwanda was conducted in 2017 supported by the Wellcome Trust\-funded ‘Global Atlas of Podoconiosis’ \[ **R3; G2**\]. In partnership with the Rwanda Biomedical Center \(the research arm of the Rwanda Ministry of Health\), Deribe and Davey demonstrated that podo was widespread in Rwanda with 80% of people with swelling of the lower limbs considered to be podo cases. 

###  **What are the mental health consequences of podoconiosis?** 

 In 2007, Deribe and Davey, in collaboration with Addis Ababa University, conducted a survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices in a community highly endemic for podo \[ **R4; G4**\]. It revealed that most community members, including health professionals \(HPs\), held negative, stigmatising attitudes towards social interactions with people affected by podo. This finding advocated for HPs’ training and the inclusion of educational components in community interventions for podo, aimed at dispelling misconceptions and stigma. In 2014, the team investigated depression prevalence in people suffering from podo, and the link between depression, disability and podo \[ **R5; G3**\]. This study demonstrated for the first time that podo sufferers were more likely to have depression, and that both depression and podo were independently associated with higher disability levels. 

###  **How should podo be treated in low\-resource settings?** 

 From 2014\-2017, Davey and Newport led a community\-based Randomised Controlled Trial \(RCT\) in northern Ethiopia, of a simple leg swelling \(lymphoedema\) treatment package funded by the Joint Global Health Trials Initiative \(MRC/WT/DFID\). The GoLBeT trial was the first trial to assess the effects of a lymphoedema management package on the most important clinical consequence of podo – lymphoedema acute attack. These attacks have devastating consequences in terms of pain, reduced productivity and potential progression to sepsis. The trial recruited 696 people with podo and showed that the package of foot hygiene, skin care, exercise, elevation, and use of socks and shoes reduced the incidence and duration of acute lymphoedema attacks \[ **R6; G5, G6**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

###  **1. National Podoconiosis Prevention, Control and Elimination Policy: Ethiopia & Rwanda** 

 Information from studies conducted by staff at the CGHR has shaped policy in two countries in East Africa – Ethiopia and Rwanda. The route to impact is via Neglected Tropical Disease \(NTD\) Masterplans, which each endemic country is required to draw up to receive donations for Mass Drug Administration \(community\-wide preventive therapy\). Due to the co\-productive nature of the research conducted in each country, CGHR members provided research\-based evidence as part of the development and writing of the Masterplans, thus ensuring the rapid implementation of their research findings. 

###  **1.1 Ethiopia – evidence\-based national NTD Masterplan and healthcare programmes** 

 <ins>LF/Podo integrated mapping</ins>. In Ethiopia, evidence from CGHR research on podo informed the first edition of the country NTD Masterplan 2013\-2015 \(Deribe K. et al., *Parasit. Vectors*, 2012\), and the need for a nationwide mapping of the disease. At subsequent national NTD review meetings, Deribe and Davey presented CGHR findings on podo mapping \[ **R1**\] and estimation of the disease burden \[ **R2**\], which in turn informed the Ethiopia NTD Masterplan second edition 2015/16\-2019/20 \[ **S1**\]. As a result, the country met two milestones for podo elimination \[ **S1**\] by 2016: \(1\) completion of podo mapping and identification of endemic districts \[ **S2, R1**\], and \(2\) burden assessment in 58 \(16%\) of the districts \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Healthcare programmes</ins> <ins>–</ins> <ins>the Preventing Podo Project \(PPP\)</ins>. In 2014, Davey and colleagues were successful in securing a UK Big Lottery Fund grant for an implementation project coordinated by the Ethiopian National Podoconiosis Action Network \(NaPAN\) – an NGO bringing together researchers, policy makers, clinicians, and representatives of all groups offering care to patients with podo in Ethiopia. The PPP was a three\-year implementation project \(2014\-2017, GBP499,078 award \+ in\-kind/financial support, total GBP2,214,745\), aiming to extend small\-scale interventions of podo case management in the three regions of Ethiopia most affected by podo \[ **R1**\]. The successful project application was based on the CGHR research on the social \[ **R4**\] and mental health impact of podo \[ **R5**\]. The project contributed to the capacity building of 370 government health professionals and 182 health extension workers trained in podo morbidity management \[ **S2**\], with 67% expressing confidence in their ability to provide podo care \[ **S3**\]. As a result, 68,181 podo patients \(around 5% of the national total\) who would otherwise not have had access to treatment, were treated for podo and 115,653 individuals in podo endemic districts were educated on the disease through 1,150 community events, 55 district workshops, and 16 rounds of national radio campaigns \[ **S3**\]. A network of 18 patient\-led groups was also established for a more sustainable and accessible community\-based approach to podo \[ **S3**\]. Finally, the PPP was instrumental in catalysing \[text removed for publication\] \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Development of the LF/Podo Morbidity Management and Disability Prevention \(MMDP\) guidelines</ins>. Davey and Deribe contributed to the development of the LF/Podo MMDP guidelines \[ **S4**\] via NaPAN, using CGHR data on the mental health impact of podo \[ **R5**\]. These research findings enabled advocacy for psychological and socioeconomic support to complement medical and surgical care, which ensured full reintegration of patients into their communities \[ **S4**\]. These findings helped to define the patient counselling element of the care package, alongside medical care. As of February 2016, the guidelines were used to train a total of 300 health care workers and full coverage of the MMDP guidelines had been achieved in 87% of endemic districts, leading to the treatment of 153,250 people \[ **S2**\]. 

 <ins>Lymphoedema Management Package</ins>. The GoLBeT trial provided the research\-based evidence for a simple treatment intervention on which to base national policy. It showed that a simple, inexpensive care package was effective in reducing the frequency and duration of acute lymphoedema attacks resulting in increased work productivity and quality of life \[ **R6**\]. In March 2019, the results of the trial were presented at workshops held to draft the third National Masterplan alongside CGHR research on podo burden assessment \[ **R2**\]. The GoLBeT care package is set to be incorporated in the next five\-year Ethiopian NTD Masterplan \(2020\-2025\) \[ **S5**\] and has been used by the \[text removed for publication\] \[ **S8**\]. 

###  **1.2 CGHR\-led podo research contribution to Rwanda NTD Strategic Plans** 

 In Rwanda, the CGHR research \[ **R3**\] has been described as “an impressive and substantial undertaking \[…\] reaching more than 1:10 Rwandans” and resulting in 282 community health workers being trained to identify podo cases \[ **S6**\]. The findings contributed to advocacy for podo interventions in the 2017\-2020 NTD Strategic Plan \[ **S7a**\] and CGHR staff advised on the podo elimination plan. In 2018, the study results were presented internally within the Rwanda Ministry of Health and underpinned the podo section of the 2019\-2024 NTD Strategic Plan, which sets the strategies to reduce the burden of the disease by 2024 \[ **S7b, S8**\]. Amongst these initiatives are the training of health professionals, establishment of 10 podo treatment centres in the most affected districts, and education of the population to the importance of foot hygiene and shoe\-wearing. Through Foot *work*, CGHR secured a three\-year \(2020\-2023\) implementation award funded by the IZUMI Foundation to support the government in this first step \[ **S8**\]. \[text removed for publication\]. The CGHR IZUMI award is critical for Rwanda’s government to implement the podo\-specific initiatives laid out in its NTD Strategic Plan, due to limited internal resources available to tackle this disease. 

###  **2. Global Advocacy on podo elimination** 

 CGHR research on podo prevalence and distribution mapping in Ethiopia and Rwanda has been pivotal for disease advocacy. In 2010, Davey was invited to give a presentation to the WHO Neglected Tropical Diseases department about podo which, until then, was not one of the diseases considered by the department. As a result of this presentation, the WHO NTD department integrated podo under its “other neglected tropical conditions”. This recognition by the WHO catalysed significant changes to policy development within Ethiopia. Through this recognition, the country was able to include podo in their 2013\-2015 NTD Master Plan and mobilise essential resources \(such as the network of district\-level NTD\-leads\) to control the disease \[ **S9**\]. 

 In 2018, the WHO NTD department put together a pictorial training guide on neglected tropical diseases of the skin for district health workers, to support capacity building in the diagnosis and treatment of NTDs. Davey and colleagues’ research informed the podo section of the WHO training guide \[ **S10**\] which has since been converted into an interactive new mobile phone app \[ **S11**\]. Dr Jose Postigo, Medical Officer, Skin NTDs team, WHO Department of Control of NTD, at the announcement of the app’s launch in July 2020, explained its significance as follows: 

 “This software application will quickly allow health care workers and the public to get information about a specific disease – such as its clinical features, management and geographical distribution – and also provide a list of potential diagnosis.” \[ **S11**\] 

 In July 2020, Davey and colleagues, \[text removed for publication\], put together a series of user\-friendly slides on podo for district health workers training on the disease. This includes the latest GoLBeT care package \[ **S12**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 LSHTM research underpinned the rollout of the novel group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine \(MenAfriVac\), which halted the scourge of epidemic meningitis across the African meningitis belt and prevented over 100,000 deaths. More than 300 million people aged 1 to 29 in this area and in neighbouring countries had the vaccine. The clinical trial showed for the first time that MenAfriVac was highly effective at preventing meningococcal disease and carriage. This accelerated the move to implement mass vaccination campaigns, which ultimately led to group A meningitis virtually disappearing from the entire region. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For the last century, there have been frequent large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis  in the Sahelian and sub\-Sahelian region of Africa. Stretching from the Gambia in the west to Eritrea in the east, the area is known as the meningitis belt. These epidemics were mostly caused by strains of *Neisseria meningitis*, the meningococcus belonging to the capsular group A. With no vaccine, the epidemics caused many deaths and widespread disruption to the health systems and communities. In 2001, a public\-private partnership \(The Meningitis Vaccine Project\) of the World Health Organization \(WHO\), the non\-profit global health organisation PATH, and the Serum Institute for India, developed an affordable group A meningococcal vaccine for use in Africa. The vaccine, MenAfriVac, was prequalified by the WHO in 2010 based on its safety and immunogenicity, but there were no direct data on its ability to prevent meningococcal disease. Scientists needed to study carriage to fully understand the epidemiology of meningococcal infection as most people infected with meningococcus show no symptoms, but are responsible for transmitting the infection. Therefore, a successful vaccine had to prevent carriage. In 2009, an LSHTM\-coordinated consortium, The African Meningitis Consortium \(MenAfriCar\), was set up to study meningococcal carriage in the African meningitis belt. This included an evaluation of the impact of MenAfriVac on meningococcal disease and carriage, led by LSHTM’s Greenwood. 

 Chad — the only country in the meningitis belt to be experiencing a group A epidemic at the time of the first deployment of MenAfriVac — was unable to introduce the vaccine across the whole country simultaneously due to its large size and underdeveloped infrastructure. Only the capital N’Djamena and its surroundings were vaccinated initially. This staggered implementation provided an opportunity for MenAfriCar to study the impact of the MenAfriVac vaccine \(3.1, 3.2\). LSHTM staff working within MenAfriCar established strong links with partners in Chad and the consortium strengthened epidemic surveillance measures and laboratory detection of meningococci in the country. LSHTM staff obtained funding for the evaluation, planned its design and supported local teams undertaking surveillance for meningitis, detection of carriage and laboratory detection of *N. meningitidis* and other causes of meningitis. LSHTM’s main partner in Chad was the Centre de Support en Santé International, which carried out some of the surveillance activities and conducted the carriage studies. LSHTM staff also worked with the Ministry of Health and Médecins sans Frontières in their efforts to contain the epidemic. Laboratories in Oxford and Oslo undertook molecular characterisation of meningococcal isolates obtained during the epidemic. 

 In 2012, when vaccination was restricted to N’Djamena and surrounding areas, there were 57 cases of meningitis in approximately 2.3 million residents in the vaccinated areas, and 3,809 cases among the 8.7 million residents in the non\-vaccinated areas. This represented a 94% reduction in case incidence of meningitis. Vaccination had been restricted to those aged 1 to 29, but cases were prevented in all age groups, suggesting that the vaccine interrupted transmission of the epidemic strain by preventing carriage of meningococcus. 

 The 2 large pharyngeal carriage studies conducted by MenAfriCar from 2010 to 2012 in an area south of N’Djamena confirmed this observation. 32 group A meningococcal carriers were found in 4,278 age\-stratified subjects 2 to 4 months before vaccination, but only one carrier was found in the 5,001 subjects tested 4 to 6 months after vaccination. This study demonstrated for the first time that MenAfriVac was highly effective in protecting not just vaccinated but also unvaccinated individuals, via herd immunity, and could halt an epidemic. 

 Further evaluation studies by the consortium in countries which had introduced the vaccine demonstrated that MenAfriVac had achieved high vaccination coverage, with results published in 2015 showing significant decrease of disease incidence and reductions in pharyngeal carriage in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals \(3.3, 3.4\). These provided further confirmation that the vaccine generated herd immunity and prevented meningitis A epidemics.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research carried out by the MenAfriCar consortium in Chad, led by staff from LSHTM and local partners, demonstrated for the first time that MenAfriVac was highly effective in reducing transmission of group A meningococcus by preventing carriage and thus halting an epidemic. It also suggested that if people across the meningitis belt were given the vaccine, group A meningococcal disease could be eliminated. Crucially, the findings gave the international community, including The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \(Gavi\), the confidence to invest in and accelerate widespread deployment of the vaccine. It has since been given to over 300 million people in Africa through mass campaigns. On the basis of study results, MenAfriVac has also been incorporated into the routine infant immunisation programme in many African meningitis belt countries to sustain protection against group A outbreaks. 

 **Informing vaccination strategy** 

 The trial results were disseminated through face\-to\-face meetings with stakeholders in the Ministry of Health and major non\-governmental organisations in Chad, as well as with WHO staff. The study findings were also presented in reputable journals, at a meeting of the UK Meningitis Research Foundation in November 2013, and at a symposium during the 2014 annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 

 LSHTM researchers presented their results at the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation meeting of October 2014 in the session ‘Meningococcal A conjugate vaccine impact and routine immunisation schedule in infants and young children’ \(5.1\). The study results were cited in the WHO 2015 Meningococcal A conjugate vaccine updated guidance on the use of meningococcal conjugate vaccines, and led the WHO to emphasise the importance of completing mass vaccination campaigns in individuals aged 1 to 29 years in all countries in the African meningitis belt. Based on the high level of herd immunity demonstrated by mass campaigns, the updated guidance in 2015 specifically introduced additional recommendations to those in the 2011 position paper: 

-  *That countries of the African meningitis belt complete their campaigns in individuals aged 1\-29 years and introduce 1 dose of meningococcal A conjugate vaccine at 9\-18 months of age into the routine immunisation programme within 1\-5 years following their mass campaign. A one\-time catch\-up campaign should also be conducted for birth cohorts born since the initial mass vaccination and who will be outside the target age for the routine dose.* 

-  *That periodic campaigns should be considered where routine childhood vaccination is less than 60%, to provide sufficient herd protection to protect those not immunised* \(5.2\). 

 These updated recommendations benefited the rest of the meningitis belt countries still to experience implementation of MenAfriVac via Gavi support; a further 60 million people via catch\-up campaigns in the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Guinea Bissau, Chad, Kenya \(2016\) and Burundi, Eritrea, Rwanda, and Tanzania \(2017\) \(5.3\). 

 In 2018, a WHO task force was established to develop a global roadmap for how to control and defeat meningitis by 2030, with LSHTM representation from Greenwood and others in their capacity as experts. The roadmap set out a call to action to improve prevention and epidemic control of meningitis, disease surveillance and treatment, support for patients, and advocacy and engagement, and in 2020 the World Health Assembly approved the roadmap and adopted a new resolution to defeat meningitis within the decade \(5.4\). 

 **Mass rollout of the vaccine** 

 A review by the WHO of country reports on MenAfriVac and routine WHO immunisation data showed that by the end of 2018, 304.9 million people in 22 of 26 meningitis belt countries had received MenAfriVac through mass campaigns. By the end of 2018, a total of 8 of the 26 countries had introduced MenAfriVac into their routine immunisation programmes including 7 with catch\-up vaccinations for birth cohorts born after the initial roll\-out: Ghana and Sudan \(2016\), Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Mali and Niger \(2017\), and Côte d’Ivoire \(2018\). The Central African Republic introduced MenAfriVac into its routine immunisation programme immediately after the mass 1\- to 29\-year\-old vaccinations in 2017 so no catch\-up was needed. The Gambia and Nigeria ran catch\-up campaigns in 2019 before introduction into routine immunisation. \(5.3\) 

 **Targeted approach led to herd immunity** 

 By targeting over 227 million 1 to 29 year olds between 2010 and 2018, the mass vaccination campaigns helped to bring about herd immunity in the 26 countries of the meningitis belt. Serogroup A meningitis virtually disappeared in all areas where the vaccine was given, with the primary cause of epidemic meningitis, the group A meningococcus, practically eliminated from the entire region. In vaccinated populations, confirmed group A diseases incidence was reduced by more than 99% \(5.5\). It was estimated in 2015 by the Centre for Global Development that 142,000 young lives were saved, around 284,000 permanent disabilities avoided, and more than 1 million meningitis cases prevented \(5.6\). MenAfriVac was also featured in the ‘Millions Saved’ project in the published book *Millions Saved: New Cases of Proven Success in Global Health*, as a case study of a remarkable result developed from strategic partnerships, innovative technology, and a drive to end the cycle of disease. 

 Gavi disbursed USD367 million to meningitis A programmes for campaigns and an emergency stockpile of the vaccine, offering financial support to countries integrating MenAfriVac into childhood immunisation programmes. The mass vaccination campaign cost USD1.40 per person, and it is estimated that MenAfriVac achieved a cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year \(DALY\) averted of USD96.36, confirming its cost\-effectiveness. 

  

 While deployment of MenAfriVac may have eventually occurred in the African meningitis belt without the MenAfriCar research, the research of LSHTM and partners significantly contributed to the accelerated rollout and scale up of this vaccine, and continued global elimination efforts, as recognised by the WHO \(5.7\).

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Venous leg ulcers are painful, recurring wounds affecting a minimum of 20,000, mainly older people, in the UK at any one time. These ulcers result in large wound\-specific NHS care costs annually. Findings from our University of Manchester research have improved outcomes for people with venous leg ulcers and increased efficiency in the NHS. We demonstrated that multi\-component compression bandages with an elastic layer are more effective at healing venous leg ulcers than other bandage options. We subsequently showed that, for people eligible to receive them, 2\-layer compression stockings are similarly effective for treating venous leg ulcers but reduce ulcer recurrence and are more cost\-effective. In 2018 alone, increased prescribing of 2\-layer stockings saved the NHS approximately GBP7,000,000.

#  2. Underpinning research 

##  Overall summary of underpinning research 

 Our Cochrane systematic review \[1\] showed that multi\-component bandages for people with venous leg ulcers lead to increased healing at lower cost than no compression or single\-layer systems. Furthermore, multi\-component systems with an elastic layer are more effective than inelastic systems. Our subsequent randomised controlled trial \(457 participants\), funded by NIHR to fill the evidence gap identified by our systematic review, showed that 2\-layer compression stockings are more cost\-effective than the 4\-layer \(elastic containing\) multi\-component bandages and also reduce ulcer recurrence rates \[3,4\]. Survey data highlighted the need for translation of this research into practice to increase the use of 2\-layer compression stockings. 

##  Details of underpinning research 

 Our qualitative research with leg ulcer patients showed for the first time that complete ulcer healing is the outcome that is most important to them \[2\]. Our Cochrane systematic review \[1\] drew together 48 randomised trials \(4,321 participants\), including the first meta\-analysis of individual patient data in the wounds field, to explore the effect of compression on ulcer healing. 

-  **Our review showed that compression increases ulcer healing compared with no compression. Multi\-component compression systems are more effective in healing venous leg ulcers than single layer systems. Multi\-component bandage systems with an elastic layer are more effective than inelastic bandage systems** \[1\]. 

 Whilst multi\-component bandages are effective, they are bulky to wear and their safe application requires training and skill. 2\-layer, below\-knee, compression stockings are much less bulky and do not require skilled application, they deliver predictable and consistent levels of pressure and may be more comfortable. 

-  **Our systematic review showed little in the way of robust evaluation by randomised controlled trial of 2\-layer compression stockings for treating open venous leg ulcers** \[1\]. 

 In response, we conducted a randomised controlled trial \(VenUS IV, involving 457 people\) \[3,4\]. This large, rigorous pragmatic trial compared the 4\-layer bandage with 2\-layer compression stockings in those people suitable for stocking use. We found that: 

-  **Ulcers treated with 4\-layer bandages or with 2\-layer compression stockings take a similar amount of time to heal** \[3,4\]. 

-  **On average, people receiving stockings were less likely to experience ulcer recurrence and stockings were more cost\-effective \(annual costs on average GBP302 less per person\)** \[3,4\]. 

 We conducted a cross\-sectional survey in Greater Manchester and East Lancashire to determine the extent of use of 2\-layer stockings: the total population covered by the study was 1,935,683. The survey found that: 

-  **Whilst there was use of multi\-component compression bandages, there was almost no use of 2\-layer compression stockings across these areas, highlighting the need for translation of research into practice to encourage impact** \[5\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Venous leg ulcers are the most common type of complex wound: they are painful and unpleasant for those affected and incur high costs for the NHS. Venous ulcers can be treated with compression applied to the leg by bandages or stockings, but there are many compression options since these medical devices come to market rapidly, generally without evidence of clinical and cost\-effectiveness. Within this context our research has provided high certainty evidence to support decision\-making by all stakeholders. 

##  Pathways to impact 

1.  1. Our work has been cited in international guidelines and recommended evidence practice documents including: 

1.  **Systematic review of compression** \[1\] — \(i\) *Management of Chronic Venous Disease Clinical: Practice Guidelines of the European Society for Vascular Surgery \(2015\). \(ii\) Management of patients with venous leg ulcers. Wounds Australia and the European Wound Care Association \(2016\)*. \(iii\) *Public Health England. Venous leg ulcers: Infection diagnosis and microbiological investigation. Quick reference guide for primary care: For consultation and local adaptation \(2016\)* and \(iv\) *National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) Clinical Knowledge Summaries \(2019\)\*.* 

1.  **VenUS IV** \[3,4\] — \(i\) *NICE Clinical Knowledge Summary \(2019\)\* Wounds UK. Best Practice Statement: Holistic Management of Venous Leg Ulceration. London \(2016\)* and \(ii\) *NHS England Rightcare Scenario: Betty’s story \(2017\).* 

1.  *\*The main UK Guideline for venous leg ulcers has not been updated since 2010: discussions are underway with NICE. In the interim and in recognition of key evidence that required recognition this Clinical Knowledge Summary was rapidly updated in 2019.* 

 2. We have undertaken extensive local knowledge mobilisation and implementation work via the NIHR CLAHRC\-GM Leg Ulcer Quality Improvement \(ILUMIN\) Programme, considered a pathway to impact here. This was an evidence\-based improvement strategy to enhance delivery of evidence\-based quality standards for leg ulcer management which included: use of the highest level of compression therapy possible where clinically appropriate and use of high compression 2\-layer stocking kits, where clinically appropriate. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

 **Influencing and sustaining the use of effective modes of compression for venous leg ulceration **.** There are many compression options for leg ulcer treatment. Our systematic review, which is the main evidence internationally for compression, has been pivotal in promoting compression therapy as the only venous leg ulcer\-focused medical device proven to reduce time to ulcer healing. By evidencing the need for compression and by identifying multilayer compression with an elastic layer as the most effective bandage option, our research increased and contributed to promoting and sustaining high levels of optimal compression prescribing in the UK and internationally. 

 We demonstrate our impact in England using routine NHS community prescribing data \(England\). In 1998, about 200,000 packs of multi\-component elastic\-containing bandages were used to treat venous leg ulcers; this increased to approximately 800,000 packs in 2014 \[A\]. 

 Further support of our positive impact on compression use comes from the Regional Chief Nurse North \(NHS England & NHS Improvement\) who has formally acknowledged the importance of the research cited in this case study in ‘ *promoting and sustaining high levels of optimal compression prescribing in the UK’* \[B\]. This point is also acknowledged by the Director of the National Wound Care Strategy Programme: our Cochrane review \[1\] informs the National Wound Care Strategy Programme’s approach for venous leg ulcers and impacted on the decision to include a compression\-related indicator in the planned 2020/21 NHS Commissioning for Quality and Innovation \(CQUIN\) on assessment, diagnosis and treatment of lower leg wounds and forms the evidence base for that indicator \[C\]. 

 The compression review \[1\] has also had impact internationally. For example, the review has been “… *pivotal in sustaining the promotion of compression therapy to patients and staff in the 4VLU Collaboration in New Zealand, a combined academic and clinical research group. The six clinical centres in the 4VLU Collaboration are located in the major cities across the country \(Auckland, South Auckland, Hamilton, \[covering the Waikato region\], Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin \[covering Otago and Southland regions\) and together provide services to 55% of the New Zealand population”* \[D\]. 

 Whilst our work led to the promotion of compression bandages internationally, it also highlighted where there was further potential to evaluate non\-bandage compression products which had the potential to be valuable \(less reliant on operator skill, less bulky\). 

 **Increasing use of 2\-layer compression stockings.  In 2013, before publication of VenUS IV findings, there were 25,237 complete 2\-layer stocking kits prescribed in England in the community: that figure had been stable for 8 years \(Figure 1\).  Following publication of VenUS IV there was a year\-on\-year increase in prescribing of 2\-layer stockings. In 2018, 46,521 full kits were prescribed: an increase of 21,284 kits from 2013 \(an 84% increase; Figure 1\). 





 *Figure 1: Quantity of 2\-layer compression stocking kits \(stocking and liners together\) prescribed annually in England Community NHS Services* \[A\]. 

 As each person receives an average of two kits annually, we can estimate that approximately 23,260 people received 2\-layer compression stockings in 2018. With a mean annual cost\-saving of hosiery \(estimated from VenUS IV\) of GBP302 per person compared with standard compression this equates to a mean saving for the NHS of approximately GBP7,000,000 in 2018. We are confident in attributing this increase to VenUS IV and subsequent knowledge mobilisation: there was no other significant research or quality improvement activity in the area at the time in the UK or internationally. 

 Increased used of 2\-layer compression stockings is further evidenced by the results of a recent survey of 139 registered nurses in the UK who regularly treat people with venous leg ulcers. Data showed that 2\-layer compression stockings are the third most frequently used type of compression, used by most respondents \[E\]. Whilst similar pre\-2014 data are not available we know from working with over 30 trial sites during VenUS IV that 2\-layer compression stockings were used infrequently \(in total 6.8% of participants were receiving this at baseline\) and in many NHS Trusts were not listed in their wound treatment formulary. 

 **Measurement of increased use of 2\-layer compression stockings in local areas.  From our local NIHR\-CLAHRC\-GM ILUMIN implementation work, we have local data demonstrating further impact in terms of increased use of 2\-layer compression stockings for venous ulcer treatment. At the start of ILUMIN in East Lancashire in November 2017, 2\-layer compression stockings were worn by 8% of people with a venous leg ulcer, compared with 25% on completion of this work in October 2018 \[F\]. 

 Local data from NHS Wakefield Clinical Commissioning Group show 100 2\-layer compression stocking kits used in year 2013/14, increasing to more than 450 stocking kits in 2018/19 \(only 8 months of data available for this last year\). Activity by local clinical teams that supported this increase was driven by the findings of VenUS IV \[G, H\].

 In partnership with the Tate’s innovative social engagement programme ‘Tate Exchange’, Bates has collaborated with schools and community groups in Dover and the Rhondda Valley to: 

1.  Successfully challenge the Tate to change their approach to socially engaged practice, focusing on the involvement of and engagement with marginalised groups of young people. 

1.  Work with and alongside community practitioners and marginalised groups to develop and embed new forms of socially engaged practice \(Politically Engaged Artistic Practice\). This has facilitated the change in 1. 

1.  Develop the agency, confidence and political knowledge of young people so they themselves can effect change. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research insights underpinning this case study were developed between 2007 and 2020 at Canterbury Christ Church University \(CCCU\). These insights are both theoretical and practice\-based. The practice\-based component \(which embodies a model of practice which we term ‘Politically Engaged Artistic Practice’ \[R6\]\) builds on already published theoretical work \[R1; R2; R3; R4; R5\], and was developed in long\-standing \(more than 4 years\) collaboration with our community partners and practitioners in the context of the Tate Exchange Programme \[R6\]. Our partners included Astor College, Dover; Dover smART Project \(both situated in Kent\); and Valleys Kids \(situated in Rhondda Valley, Wales\). 

 The theoretical work has demonstrated how political theory can help to address issues which relate to the lived experience of real people – such as poverty, marginalisation and exclusion. As such it is a form of applied political theory. Key insights of this work include: 

1.  That hierarchical strategies of politics are damaging and counter\-productive to the interests of marginalised individuals and groups.  \[R1\-5\] 

1.  That negative ‘othering’ has a detrimental impact on the sense of power and agency of marginalised individuals and groups. \[R1; R4; R5; R6\] 

1.  That socially engaged artistic practice is particularly effective in activating the agency of politically disaffected marginalised individuals and groups. \[R6\] 

 Through the practice of co\-creation which Politically Engaged Artistic Practice embodies, we developed further insights: That our young participants did not consider traditional politics as an effective arena for expressing their voice, and for addressing those issues which concern ‘people like them’. This does not mean that they were not political. Once in an encouraging space our young people developed a power and consequent agency to engage head\-on with the political issues impacting their lived experience. But such space has to be created; this is challenging because elite art institutions often find the power and agency of marginalised young people to be threatening, and so construct barriers to inclusion. These insights are evidenced in our co\-created exhibitions \(see Section 4\). Building on these insights, we developed the following findings which comprise the basis of our practice \[R6\].  These can be stated as: 

1.  Practices of non\-hierarchical politics can help young people to combat marginalisation and negative othering, and therefore effect positive change. This means that participants will value themselves and their work – and therefore demand respect from others \- if they are equals in the process of creating that work. 

1.  Non\-hierarchical practices are more effective at engaging politically the everyday lived experiences of participants, than ‘top\-down’ approaches which seek to ‘help’ rather than work ‘with and alongside’ \[a key concept of R6\]. 

1.  Affective, playful and joyous practice – influenced by the best of socially engaged ‘live art’ – enhances the agency of participants, and their confidence to assert their political voice and power. 

 Politically Engaged Artistic Practice can be \(and in our work has been\) an effective way of critiquing elite art institutions, and influencing them to institute positive change. We found that we can work ‘with and alongside’ our participants to change for the better what Tate does.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 On 31<sup>st</sup> May 2019, young people from Astor College, Tower Hamlets, Dover \(in the top 20% of the most deprived areas in the UK\) chanted their own political slogan \(‘What is art? This is art\!’\), while banging drums, as they danced through the Blavatnik Building, in the Tate Modern. They were followed around the space by young people from Valleys Kids in the Rhondda Valley \(the 4<sup>th</sup> most deprived area in Wales\), and members of the public who had got caught up in an incredibly moving moment. This was a milestone in a journey of community engagement. It was also year three of our co\-created work with Tate Exchange. Since 2017, **7,997** international visitors to Tate Exchange have engaged with our work \[S7; S8\]. 

 We have developed an approach to politically engaged artistic practice \[R6\], which makes key themes of political theory \[R1\-R5\] relevant to the lived experience of young people. 

 **Impact 1:** **Successfully challenging the Tate to change their approach to socially engaged practice** 

 Awareness of Bates’s work by the Director of Learning and Research at Tate led to an invitation for Canterbury Christ Church University to become a Founding Associate of Tate Exchange \[S2\].  Since 2016, there have been **323,062** visitors to Tate Exchange; our practice has shaped its programming and culture. \[S7; S8\] 

 Tate Exchange was imagined as a space to challenge the elitism often evident in traditional gallery spaces. We helped Tate to understand this challenge, and to deliver change through co\-creative practice. Bates developed work with Valleys Kids \(specifically with the Artistic Director of Sparc\)  \[S3\] in a partnership which has harnessed the power of young people to effect change. 

 Our work involved a loud and celebratory occupation of the Tate Modern gallery \(characterised in R6 as ‘progressive exclusion’\). This led to challenging conversations and key changes. Tate leadership, report of a new staff training programme and attitudinal change by the curatorial team. This includes a commitment to programming which deals politically with lived experiences of ‘non\-traditional’ audiences \[S1; S2\]. It also led to an invitation by Tate’s Director of Learning and Research to publish R6. The Head of the Tate Exchange programme refers to our work as a ‘game\-changer’ for Tate practice \[S1\].  Tate’s Director of Learning and Research writes of how this work has fed 

 ‘directly into how we \[Tate\] have thought about engaging with participants from marginalised groups and communities, and importantly \(re\) thinking what Tate Exchange is for and could be… ’ \[S2\] 

 As a result of Tate developing more inclusive practices of programming and curation, our young participants have been able to create politically focused work which has enhanced their sense of agency. As one young participant stated: 

 ‘I didn’t know that the Tate could be used as such a political movement. The way that we were able to use the space in the Tate to interact with the public and everyone could get involved, outside of the standard expectation of art.’ \[S6\] 

 **Impact 2:** **Working with and alongside community practitioners and marginalised groups to develop and embed politically engaged artistic practice** 

 A co\-funded artist’s residency to the value of GBP 10,000 with the Live Arts Development Agency \(LADA\), was an initial spur to our practice \[R6; S9; S10\]. But it is our community groups and young people who have provided its power and creativity. The CEO of Dover smART \(an organisation which uses art to support disadvantaged young people in Dover\) has noted how the project enhanced practitioners’ political agency and that of service users \[S4\]. The Artistic Director of the Valleys Kids Sparc programme insists: 

 ‘Through this collaboration we were able to produce some exceptionally powerful work which explored issues such as marginalisation, gender and class identity… Without encountering Professor Bates’s work through Tate exchange, we would not have had the opportunity to discover how work in political theory could possibly inform what we do…’ \[S3\] 

 This work then effected the change detailed in Impact 1 \[S1; S2\]. The reach of this work has gone beyond Tate Exchange, with a legacy which feeds back into our communities. During lockdown, Dover smART have included our co\-created work on power and politics in creative arts packages distributed to over **3,000** of the most vulnerable members of the community. The CEO of Dover smART states: 

 ‘We have adapted and repurposed materials from our work on the theme of Power with Canterbury Christ Church and have delivered these in Creative Care Packages sent out to the vulnerable groups and individuals with which we have been working.’ \[S4\] 

 Work resulting from these packages will be part of an online exhibition in 2021 – which addresses the theme of power, love and mutual aid. 

 **Impact 3:  Developing the agency, confidence and political knowledge of young people so they themselves can effect change** 

 We have provided over **100 young** people from marginalised communities with opportunities to enhance their voice through political art. Key points along this journey include: two exhibitions at the Sidney Cooper Gallery \(2017 and 2018\), Canterbury; a programme of over 20 politically engaged artistic practice workshops in Dover and the Rhondda Valley; a ‘Political Carnival’ as part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science \(2019\), which ensured a wider engagement with young people from regional communities. 

 Our young people report how the work gave them the confidence to engage with challenging political discussions with the public and staff on the floor of the Tate Modern. Consequently, they were able to tackle elitism head\-on \[S6\]. 

 The Principal of Astor College, Dover writes: ‘The opportunities from participating in the projects has benefitted the pupils in many ways and it is a testament to the vision and purpose of the project that so much has been gained and achieved.’ \[S5\] As one participant \(who before this project had never been to London, even though living in Dover\) states: ‘I used to be quite timid and stuff… and that helped me to become more confident in everyday life.’ \[S6\] 

 This increase in confidence has come alongside an increase in political knowledge. As one participant states: ‘I feel like I’ve learnt I need to focus more on politics and what’s going on in the country instead of just not caring about it at all.’ \[S6\] The Artistic Director of Sparc states: ‘Professor Bates and his colleagues enabled participants in the project to have the confidence to tackle these complex and challenging political issues head\-on.’ \[S3\] 

 The impact on participants also reaches beyond the floor of Tate Exchange. In 2018, young participants from Valleys Kids spearheaded a campaign to save their youth club from austerity cuts. The Artistic Director of Sparc states: ‘We talked about the experiences we had previously at Tate with the support of Professor Bates and ways that we could effect change.’ This resulted in the creation of a bilingual social media campaign, influenced the making of a pop\-up youth club installation in year 2 of Tate Exchange, and a film about their experiences, political journey and growing confidence viewed by over 10,000 people through different channels. The work of the young people received a nomination for a National Youth Award 2018. The film was also presented to the Local Council Rhondda Cynon Taff County Borough Council. As a result, funds were redirected by the Council to ensure that the youth club remained open as a front\-line service for one day per week.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Cheshire, Warrington and Shropshire regions are characterised by diverse economies with a dynamic and growing small and medium sized enterprise \(SME\) base. Chester Business School’s \(CBS\) research into SME networks, decision making, inclusion and wellbeing, underpinned the refocusing of large\-scale SME intervention and support programmes to better engage and cultivate relationships with a diverse range of hard\-to\-reach entrepreneurs and SME owner\-managers. By working closely with key economic stakeholders \(Local Enterprise Partnerships \- LEPs, Local Authorities, and Chambers of Commerce\) CBS deployed the largest portfolio of publicly funded SME support programmes of any UK Business School to drive the economic potential of SMEs. Pathways to the impact were secured through £34.74m in grants that enabled tailored support to 1,632 SMEs over the last 6 years, resulting in 312.3 new and 113.9 safeguarded jobs, 100 innovations, improvements in women and ethnic minority entrepreneurs receiving support, improved sustainability, and a net GVA improvement of £44.54m for the region.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The underpinning research in this case study is drawn from CBS’s ‘responsible enterprise’ and ‘work\-based learning for decent work’ research clusters. Here, Dr **Hancock** \(2002\-present\), 

 Dr **Moore** \(2002\-present\), Prof. **Stokes** \(2010\-2016\), and Prof. **Manning** \(2014\-present\) examined antecedents and on\-going sense making processes of owner\-mangers / entrepreneurs which profoundly shape growth aspirations, as well as the development of trust in industrial communities and networks and its impact in delivering an effective range of interventions across sectors and sub\-regions. Extending this work, Prof. **Wall’s** \(2010\-present\) research examined how these factors support or hinder owner\-manager resilience and wider SME resilience and continuity, and Dr **Ullah** \(2015\-present\) examined the issues of diversity and inclusion and their relationship with business growth and continuity. CBS researchers typically led study design and implementation, supported by international scholars to enrich analysis, for example, Profs **Cooper** \(Manchester\), **Liu** and **Tarba** \(Birmingham University Business School\), **Thomson** \(Nottingham Trent\), and **Hormiga** and **Valls\-Pasola** \(Barcelona\). 

 Through CBS’s close engagement with regional stakeholders, researchers identified economic development priorities. Whilst diverse economically, SMEs in Cheshire and Shropshire, and the networks they occupy, appear to exhibit common and persistent challenges that CBS’s engagement identified and research guided interventions sought to address: **\(1\)** leadership and network challenges that stymie productivity and innovation, **\(2\)** digital and environmental sustainability, **\(3\)** spatial variability in social capital and networks that limit an owner\-manager’s confidence and resources to tackle formidable and complex challenges \(e.g. Brexit and COVID\-19\), **\(4\)** reconciling key short and long\-term objectives that often determine the economic sustainability of the enterprise; and, **\(5\)** adaptable, skilled and resilient workforces. Three overarching and interconnected research underpinned interventions which led to the impact reported in this case study are: 

 **\(1\) Organisational network performance: trust, exchange, and dialogue through industrial communities **.** Stokes** **\[R1\]** examined the fragility of trust and its critical role in industrial district exchanges. Through exploring reason \(information flows\), routines \(norms and values\), and reflexivity \(on\-going and longer\-term considerations\), complex and subtle phenomena were explored that aided understanding and the cultivation of openness and trust within industrial networks. **Moore’s** **\[R6\]** work examined the behavioural and regional components of medium sized enterprises viewed through a lens of an identity which was rooted to ‘expected’ behaviour of trust, fairness, honesty, and community responsibility in producing economically sustainable businesses. This research helped to frame project design and network models for institutional and individual exchanges, reshaping the evaluative and reflective approaches participants used to cultivate productive relationships with peers, mentors, and academics. Critically, this reshaping placed more emphasis on fostering communities of practice and excellence than knowledge transfer per se, typical in previous support programmes. 

 **\(2\) SME decision making and resource allocation: Sensemaking and valuing of the tangible and intangible. Hancock’s** research **\[R2\]** stressed the limited means that newly formed enterprises possess, and the criticality of ensuring nascent entrepreneurs utilising their intangible human, structural and customer capital to assess the intrinsic performance measures of their enterprise. This research challenged HEIs to support new entrepreneurs in understanding their intellectual capital and value at the very earliest formations of the enterprise. **Manning’s** work **\[R3\]** extended perspectives on social capital, capturing the deeply social process of becoming and being an entrepreneur/owner\-manager. This work emphasised the highly situational, integrative, and processual nature of skill and knowledge accumulation that results in routinised practices. Specifically, the work highlighted the complex interpretation of dilemmas and challenges across specifiable/rational and non\-rational criteria, which had not previously been explored in large scale business support projects. This emphasised project techniques to continually shape and re\-shape dialogue as a result of evolving and maturing exchanges between owners/entrepreneurs and their increasing commitment to the programmes. Fostering peer\-to\-peer dialogue and techniques for group sharing, reflection and learning were brought to the fore in the projects, contrasting markedly to previous interventions that were didactic and content\-heavy. 

 **\(3\) SME inclusion and wellbeing: Engaging BAME entrepreneurs and hard to reach SME owner\-managers **.** Ullah’s** **\[R4\]** work explored the challenges of ethnic minority entrepreneurs in locations of constraints. This enabled engagement and conversations with Black and Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) entrepreneurs across micro \(individual preferences\), meso \(organisational financing\) and macro \(e.g. BAME employees and entrepreneurs in the place/region\) spheres. This work was particularly insightful given the lower numbers of ethnic minorities within the population generally and entrepreneurial communities across the region. **Wall’s** **\[R5\]** work added to the arsenal of SME support by examining the salient components of owner manager resilience, and the effect it has on broader SME resilience. These research insights supported CBS’s reach into increasing the relevance of programmes to BAME businesses and those organisations that often do not seek or engage in business support programmes. Framing the interventions around supporting the individual beyond the benefits of the programmes’ syllabi and allowing them to personally thrive whilst running and leading an SME was a key determinant in engaging them in the programmes.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Collectively, the research motivated CBS to reflect upon previous UK and European SME intervention programmes, to reframe and redesign the portfolio to extend its reach and efficacy as **the largest portfolio of publicly funded SME support programmes of any UK Business School**. Major SME intervention projects totalling £34.74m in grants were directly influenced by CBS’s research since 2013, **comprising around 150 partnerships** with digital agencies, mentors, entrepreneurs, business coaches, mental health and wellbeing professionals, scientific academics from the University, knowledge exchange professionals and CBS academics. These partnerships have enabled access and ongoing relationships with a significant SME population from across the region, most of which had not previously received publicly funded business support. Clare Hayward MBE DL, Chair of the Cheshire & Warrington LEP confirms that regional businesses have been critically “ *reimagining their business model or adapting their business practices”* and that a CBS project, Accelerate, helps *“businesses reskill and develop employees across the region, so that they are future ready, can maintain employee engagement and sharpen the company’s resilience and productivity”* **\[S2\]**. 

 **ERDF SME support projects** totalling £5.09m offered a wide range of support for entrepreneurs and SMEs looking to consolidate and grow their businesses \[S1, S8\]. For example, The Business Growth Programme \(Ref: 03R16P00627, £488k\) provided an SME gateway to CBS and wider university support services. The High Growth Centre \(Ref. 03120PR, £3.4m\) supported start\-ups and SMEs to improve their performance through analysing their business processes. **ERDF innovation projects** focused on specialist, intensive support for SMEs to develop and implement new products, processes and systems in particular sectors. A £9.86m portfolio comprised Innovation to Commercialisation \(Ref: 03R16P00976\), the environment and sustainability\-focused CREST \(Ref: 36R17P01462\), and Digital Solutions \(Ref: 36R17P01698\), which focuses on improving SME development and uptake of digital innovations \[S1\]. **ESF skills development projects** focused on up/re\-skilling the existing and future workforces, closely aligned to local business need and growth plans. The £15.37m portfolio includes Building Skills and Growth Capacity \(Ref: 36S18P02835\) in the Marches, and Accelerate \(Ref: 03S19 PO3307\), the flagship skills project for Cheshire & Warrington LEP \[S3\]. The **Regional Growth Fund** business grant project Catalyst for Growth \(Ref: 01.09.07.01/1953C, £4.43m\) supported the creation and safeguarding of jobs in the Northwest’s chemical sector **\[S1, S5\]**. 

 The research enabled the portfolio to significantly improve on previous structural funded initiatives, and as a result of the scale of these interventions, the contours of this impact are significant in terms of breadth and depth, and reflect the scale of ambition. 

###  Raising ambition, forging networks, and investing in innovation for SME growth. 

 Social and intellectual capital dynamics are critical in fostering and sustaining regional SME interventions especially at early stages of formation **\[R2, R3\]**, so this was brought to the fore in the design and grant application process. These capital dynamics are also linked to the reputational efforts of the business in the first few years of establishment **\[R1, R2, R6\]**, so the projects also sought to capture a significant number of very early stage enterprises in certain sectors. The projects collectively supported the social and intellectual capital development process, designed to accommodate the unpredictable, evolutionary process that reflects instrumentalism and sub\-conscious decision making that is often evident is resource constrained owner led enterprises **\[R3\]**. This required programme facilitators and contributors to understand the importance of proving credibility very quickly with, and between, participants **\[S8\]**. Equally, there was increased investment between projects to enable trust\-based relationships to form at and beyond their boundaries **\[R1, R6\]**. Dialogue, exercises and activities between entrepreneurs, owner\-managers and programme contributors sought to develop the participants’ adaptive capacity to switch between the rational and irrational sense making of situations **\[R3\]**. This challenged the heuristics that were used in complex decision making, where there was significant incomplete information, often preventing owner\-managers/entrepreneurs to make informed decisions particularly in novel or complex arenas such as environmental and digital transformation. A web\-services SME said *“The support has particularly helped to challenge unhelpful assumptions I had made about my business and my customers. It has also helped me form networks with other local business owners, which has already helped me in countless ways”  \[S4\]**. Similarly, the Chamber of Commerce recognised “ *The ability of academics and the School to engage SMEs, appreciating their sometimes\-trivial challenges, enables trust and relationships to be forged. This places support mechanisms in a good position to tackle more challenging issues when they arise… and is relatively unique in the business support landscape*” CEO, WC&NW Chamber of Commerce **\[S8\]**. Deeper exploration of these themes with academics, intermediaries, peer organisations, over protracted periods of the programmes, enabled stakeholders to support more transformational investment decisions **\[S1, S6\]**. 

 As a result of the redesign of the projects, 1,632 participants engaged in long\-term business development, planning and network cultivation activities over the last 6 years, and 132 SMEs were involved in significant research and knowledge exchange, innovation, and sustainability investment initiatives \[ **S1**\]. £21.3m of grants and private finance was leveraged on Catalyst for Growth, and feedback confirmed that “ *the support received has enabled the company to stay in business despite the outward economic conditions associated with stalled capital investments in the supply chain \(many of which were attributed to Brexit uncertainty\)*” **\[S5\]**. Similarly, a Luxury clothing SME said “ *The networking aspect of I2C has been absolutely priceless… This is particularly useful for me as our business is so diverse. I have been able to focus on each area of the business and now have a clear direction on the way forward*” **\[S6\]**. 

 Research highlighted that new entrepreneurs often underestimate their human \(motivation, employee relationships\), structural \(e.g. technology, operations, quality capabilities\) and customer \(e.g. market and customer relationships\) capital dimensions in understanding their firm’s performance beyond limited financial metrics **\[R2\]**. Projects sought to emphasise the intrinsic and wider resources that support new product, process, service, environmental and digital investments. Moreover, the programmes worked hard through intensive coaching and mentoring to raise the bar operationally and surpass current customer expectations enabling new jobs to be created as a result of increased revenues **\[R3\]**. As a result of this support, 62 nascent entrepreneurs, 131 pre\-start\-up businesses were supported **\[S1\]**. This led to 100 businesses introducing new products, 312.3 new jobs being created, and a further 133.9 jobs being safeguarded across the region **\[S1, S5\]**. A recipient of support, ‘The Goat Tree’, was awarded Best North West Student Start Up and later achieved a major honour at the national Young Enterprise Awards **\[S7\]**. 

 **\(2\) Improving information and innovation flows across sectors and sub\-regions for SME growth.** Research illustrated that industrial regions are characterised by information flows through cognitive and organisational proximity, which are reinforced by geographical proximity **\[R1, R6\]**. Crucially, openness and transparency were identified as not coming naturally to many SME owner\-managers, despite these dimensions underpinning trust, and that trust influences the depth and flow rate of critical information even within mature industrial districts **\[R1\]**. Therefore, the projects instigated clear ground rules and modes of engagement around carefully curated networks and events, and this was manifest in the appointment of highly skilled project managers to help cultivate these networks sensitively **\[S8\]**. Notions of identity and respect were cultivated across participants, and it was essential that ‘down\-to\-earth’, informal and approaches were accessible and sensitive to the investment appetite of SMEs **\[R2, R3, R4, R5, S8\]**. The research and projects confirmed that ‘inter\-SME’ relationships were significantly affected by the ‘moral’ identity that SMEs projected, which in turn affected the SME’s ability to invest, particularly in less tangible dimensions of quality and environmental sustainability **\[R6\]**. 

 As a result of the SME intervention programmes, 384 SMEs were supported to be more environmentally sustainable, with a reduction of 257 tonnes Co2 emitted, and overall, the leveraging of investments and increased outputs **created £44.54m of Gross Value Added across the region** \(£49.79mn including projected forecast\) **\[S1, S5\]**. As an authentic Indian food producer said “\[Innovate to Commercialise – I2C\] *provided us with the skills, knowledge and confidence to take our products further and grow our customer base in this exciting and competitive market*” **\[S9\]**. Similarly, another food SME owner\-manager said “ *Meeting other business owners and expanding my professional networks has been hugely beneficial. Insight from industry professionals was valuable and staff at NoWFOOD are extremely helpful. I feel that I am a part of a community of small businesses which has given me confidence and the belief that I am able to succeed*.” **\[S10\]** 

 **\(3\) SME sustainability, resilience and inclusivity.** Identity guides investment decisions across tangible and intangible investments that promote employee care and well\-being **\[R2\]**, and a sense of regional community drives organisational sustainability decisions \(longer\-term decision\-making orientation rather than solely short\-term financial measures\) **\[R6\]**. Longer\-term success of the smaller firm reflects the personal resilience of the owner\-manager, and specifically their adaptability, social support and co\-operation, confidence, and purposefulness **\[R5\]**. These flex against interpretations of the situation, resulting in ‘comfort’ or ‘ambitious’ strategic orientations **\[R3\]**. Consequently, interventions that sought to support adaptability and confidence, in particular, were seen as particularly critical in the strategic realisation process. SME owner\-managers reported “ *I feel that I am a part of a community of small businesses""* which, “ *has given me confidence and the belief that I am able to succee*d” **\[S10\]** and “ *sessions have left me feeling more confident and empowered to grow after participating in support interventions*” **\[S4\]**. 

 In terms of inclusivity, research **\[R4\]** enabled projects to make a significant step\-change in BAME entrepreneurs and owner\-managers to participate in funded programmes **from 2\-5% previously to around 23%**. Here, CBS research assisted in targeting messages to specifically engage BAME and women business leaders, also it enabled programme targets to be more informed and realistic. Similarly, additional efforts were made to engage women entrepreneurs, increasing participation rates stubbornly fixed at around **30% to circa 51% more recently \[S3\]**. 

 The net impact of these efforts is recognised by stakeholders, “\[the LEP\] *recognise the achievements of Chester Business School over the last six years in engaging the sub\-region’s small businesses and contributing to making Cheshire and Warrington one of the healthiest, most sustainable, most inclusive, and fast\-growing region’s in the UK*” CEO, Cheshire and Warrington LEP **\[S3\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The creation of a novel decision\-support system, powered by new algorithms and models developed for the first time, is helping authorities and industry to make improved and more timely decisions, resulting in greener, more efficient and more sustainable transport and logistics: 

1.  Reducing costs up to 23%, emissions up to 19%, and accidents estimated at 10% in the port/maritime industry \(VICONSHIP, the Ports of Liverpool, and COSCO Shipping Logistics\). 

1.  Improving rail performance and passenger experience, monitoring four of Merseyrail’s busiest stations \(\~24 million passengers annually\) and directly servicing \~100,000 passengers/month at Liverpool South Parkway mainline interchange \(10/10 score from station staff and 8/10 score from passengers\). 

1.  Supporting active travel options \(walking and cycling\) in the Liverpool City Region \(LCR\) by providing data/analysis to both users and local authority operators, as part of the development/upgrade of 57.5km green cycling/walking routes, to reduce greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions by an estimated 334 tonnes in the period 2019\-20. 

1.  Influencing UN policymaking on port adoption to climate change. Adoption of the safety assessment system by the Port of Dalian has led to a reduction of incidents by 8% and annual safety cost savings of £250k. 

1.  Assisting the region’s COVID\-19 response with a monitoring/evaluation system for 11 LCR popup emergency routes, supplying traffic data to the Department for Transport \(DfT\) \(March\-July 2020\) and local authorities \(March\-December 2020\), optimising people movement and social distancing measures in the LCR, and providing rail passengers with critical real\-time travel information at Liverpool South Parkway station\(56,000 passenger\-journeys\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Transport and logistics are essential drivers for economic growth and their sustainability is a challenge to UN, EU and UK government, targeting greener, more efficient and sustainable systems. These macro\-level targets have informed the evolution of sustainable transportation and logistics research at LJMU, with a focus on maritime, rail, cycling, and walking applications. 

 A novel decision\-support system has been developed in close collaboration with industry, comprising a set of tools applicable to different modes of transportation/logistics. Its impact has been validated by industrial partners. The body of the underpinning research \(£5m in grant value to LJMU in total\) that has directly led to the claimed impacts is described below: 

1.  *Research on port operations* 

 Funded by the EU \[RPs 1, 2\] and the Newton Fund \[RP 3\], we worked with various European and Far East ports to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and decrease emissions and pollution. The requirement to optimise the use of cutting\-edge technologies, such as automated vehicles and automated gates, led us to devise new mathematical/optimisation techniques, because existing methods did not work. These new models have been utilised by the port industry in all three aspects of port operations: the seaside \(berth planning and vessel stowage optimisation; *e.g*., RP 3\); the yard \(yard simulation and container stacking optimisation; *e.g*., RP 1\); and the landside \(truck appointment, vehicle routing, and bin packing optimisation; *e.g*., RP 3\). For example, the research output \[RO 1\] offered the first insights into how different advanced optimisation and simulation methods can be combined to improve the performance of ports. 

1.  *Research on railway operations* 

 Funded by DfT, the Rail Safety and Standards Board \(RSSB\), and Innovate UK, we worked with the rail industry to improve: \(a\) passenger experience \[RP 8\]; \(b\) train operations *e.g*., more accurate delay prediction and estimation of ‘slippery rail’ \[RPs 4, 7\]; and \(c\) staff and infrastructure management/communication \[RPs 4, 10\]. For example, RO 6 proposed a novel algorithm that allocates passenger seats in real\-time to increase seats utilisation and reduce congestion, taking into account arrival time, journey leg and length, passenger preferences, luggage and passenger groups. 

1.  *Research on active travel, especially cycling and walking* 

 Funded by the EU, the DfT, and additional support from industry such as \[RP 6\], we worked with local authorities, cyclists and walkers, police forces, delivery companies, and regional cycling and walking commissioners to develop new algorithms and models to tackle problems never previously addressed. This included the development of: \(a\) the first risk predictors associated with cycling for the LCR; \(b\) the first system that combines deep learning computer vision and IoT to monitor cycling/walking activities, and novel machine learning techniques to detect potholes by learning from cyclist behaviour. For example, RO 2 proposed a novel algorithm to address vehicle routing issues. 

1.  *Research on strategic decision\-making in the maritime industry* 

 Funded by the EU and ERC, we worked with policymakers and port authorities to develop analysis models involving transport safety, logistics security, and supply chain adaptation to climate change \[RPs 2, 5, 9\]. For example, a new shipping resilience risk concept to reduce incident\-related logistics costs has been developed \[RO 3\]. Port adaptation measures to climate change have been produced for port terminals that operate under uncertainties \[ROs 4, 5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The system developed at LJMU has influenced industrial practice and benefited both industry and transport users. Evidence of impact is demonstrated below: 

1.  Adoption by the port industry to improve port operations \( *e.g*. \[RPs 1, 3\]\). For example: 

 a. Vietnam’s leading logistics corporation VICONSHIP reported that the system is capable of eliminating container re\-handles, which are the number of times containers have to be reshuffled unnecessarily in the yard \(55% of all containers in the 600,000 TEUs/year case\-study port\). This is equivalent to a 23% reduction in the total cost of cargo handling and a 19% decrease in emissions from container handling vehicles \[ **Source 1**\]. In addition to cost saving, the reduction in emissions saves lives and improve quality of life. It is estimated that emissions from shipping alone cause 600 premature deaths annually in Vietnam, according to research from Nature Climate Change. \[dates of impact: 2017\] 

 b. The system reduced ship imbalance from 230 tonnes to 4.8 tonnes \[ **Source 1**\]. This work was conducted jointly with Vietnam National University Hanoi – LJMU contributed 50%. \[dates of impact: 2017\] 

 c. The system \[RO 1\] has helped the Port of Liverpool \(Peel Ports\) to better evaluate the performance of its lock system. The lock is the main entrance to the port’s second largest terminal, so understanding its performance is essential for maintaining a large throughput of 1.5m TEUs going through the lock \[ **Source 2**\]. \[dates of impact: 2016\] 

1.  Adoption by the port industry for port safety \( *e.g*. \[RPs 2, 5\]\). For example, the system has provided safety self\-assessment methods \[RO 5\], as well as a new risk analysis and alert software package. These have been incorporated into health and safety policy of several world\-leading container ports such as the Port of Dalian, P. R. China. As a result, incidents occurring in the Port of Dalian \(Dalian Container Terminal\) in 2018\- 2019 were reduced by approx. 8% \(compared to the average over the past 5 years\), while the annual safety cost saving has been estimated at £250k \[ **Source 3**\]. \[dates of impact: 2018\-19\] 

1.  Usage by the shipping industry to improve transport resilience \( *e.g*. \[RPs 2, 9\]\). For example, in 2018/19, by incorporating a new shipping resilience risk concept \[RO 3\] into COSCO’s global shipping network configuration, the system has reduced its incident\-related logistics costs by an estimated 10% \[ **Source 4**\]. The new concept has led to a paradigm shift in COSCO shipping logistics practice, moving to a new mechanism that incorporates risk assessment from a global shipping network perspective. This new approach was proven successful when it was implemented as a case study on COSCO’s Asia\-Africa logistics network. This success promoted the concept’s implementation by other COSCO logistics networks. \[dates of impact: 2018\-19\] 

1.  Usage by the UK rail industry to improve its performance and passenger experience \( *e.g*. RPs 4, 7, 8, 10\). 

 a. The system, which is powered by algorithms from publications such as \[RO 6\], has enabled the Merseyrail franchise to monitor real\-time train journeys in four of their busiest stations \(\~24 million annual rail passenger usage\). The system, currently installed in Liverpool South Parkway station, a major regional multimodal transport hub, is also providing passengers with rapid and detailed real\-time information in response to network disruption. It served about 200,000 passengers within the first two months of operation, receiving a score of 10/10 from staff who used it and 8/10 from passengers \[ **Source 5**\]. \[dates of impact: 2019\-20\] 

 b. The system was tested by Merseyrail to anticipate and mitigate reactionary delays, which is the major source of train delays in the UK. Experiments on \~500 real train journeys showed that the system improved delay prediction accuracy in all instances \[ **Source 6**\]. \[dates of impact: 2018\-19\] 

 c. The system has given Merseyrail insights into reasons and possible mitigations of slippery rail’/low railhead adhesion that has an impact on the entire Merseyrail and wider industry network. This benefits the entire Merseyrail network \[ **Source 6**\]. \[dates of impact: 2019\-20\] 

1.  The provision of cost\-effective measures for road, rail and ports \[RO 4\] and recommendations for international bodies \( *e.g*., the UN\) in global climate policymaking \[RPs 1, 2, 9\]. The identification of climate threat by major transport infrastructure via large international \(30 countries\) and UK national surveys \[ **Source 7**\] has helped transport stakeholders \( *e.g*., operators and authorities\) to improve service climate resilience. It has directly shaped UN policy on “Climate Change Impact and Adaptation for International Transport Networks” \( *i.e.,* Section 4.3.4 “Technical adaptation measures for seaports”\).  [http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp5/publications/climate\_change\_2014.pdf](http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp5/publications/climate_change_2014.pdf). Specifically, our work has assisted UN policymakers to develop guidelines and approaches in climate adaptation planning in ports and transportation infrastructures by providing methods on how climate risks should be identified and how adaptation measures can be evaluated \[ **Source 7**\]. \[Impact period: 2014\] 

1.  Assisting active travel infrastructure development and promoting active travel \( *e.g*. \[RP 6\]\). 

 a. Utilising novel sensors and artificial intelligence techniques across the six LCR local authorities, the system gathers and analyses real\-time data to support decisions such as the prioritisation of cycling/walking infrastructure development \(out of 31 strategic corridors\). Using inputs from the system, 57.5km green cycle/walking routes are being developed/upgraded to reduce regional GHG emissions by an estimated 334 tonnes in the period 2019\-21 \[ **Source 8**\]. This saves lives and improves quality of life, since the research of the British Lung Foundation in 2020 found that 1,040 deaths per year in the LCR can be directly linked to exposure to air pollution. \[Impact period: 2019\-20\] 

 b. Supporting seven regional authorities to assess current levels of walking/cycling, the impact of pollution, traffic, and measures to improve active travel. For example, using sensors located in a busy area covering over 10 schools and education settings, plus a major hospital in Liverpool, the system has informed the authority the directions of vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists at peak time. This finding has fed into the development of a segregated lane for pedestrian/cyclists and thus benefited over 14,000 people and vehicles per day \[ **Source 9**\]. \[Impact period: 2020\] 

1.  Helping government, local authorities and transport operators to respond to COVID\-19 \[RP 6\]. 

 a. Helping government and local authorities with monitoring traffic trends during lockdown. At the request of authorities, the system has been used to monitor traffic \(cars, cyclists, pedestrians *etc*.\) as well as air quality and weather across the LCR during lockdown. The data has been shared with the Department for Transport at their request, and has also been shared with the six local authorities, the Combined Authority, and the cycling/walking commissioner \[ **Source 8**\]. The data has informed the authorities of quantitative correlations between the significant increase in cycling and walking in every area of the LCR during lockdown and an improvement in air quality. It has also quantified how the public’s travel behaviour changed over the lockdown period and the impact of weather on active travel. Importantly, the data from the system has provided evidence to support local authorities’ plans for 11 emergency popup routes across the LCR, enabling people to travel safely with social distancing, and connecting them to key locations like hospitals, workplaces, and transport stations. Using algorithms from outputs such as \[RO2\], the system has also provided a journey planning app \(available on Google and Apple app stores\) that allows local authorities to input the emergency popup routes as soon as they are installed, and also monitor traffic on these routes in real\-time. So far 23km of routes have been added to the journey planner. This is the first app that allows citizens to plan journeys on popup cycling/walking routes \[ **Source 9**\]. \[Impact period: 2020\] 

 b. The system has been continuously providing rail passengers, especially key workers who had to travel to work during lockdown, with key real\-time journey information using our intelligent information system at Liverpool South Parkway station. During the four months of lockdown, the system benefited over 56,000 passengers \[ **Source 6**\].  \[Impact period: 2020\] 

 c. The data from the system has helped the DfT and its partners to analyse how the COVID\-19 national lockdown impacted local road and cycling networks. Partly thanks to this contribution, the aforementioned work by DfT has been awarded ‘Project of the Year 2020’ at the ITS \(UK\) Awards, and also ‘highly commended’ for ‘Outstanding Contribution to the COVID\-19 Response’ at the British Construction Industry Awards 2020. The project team at LJMU have been issued with a certificate for this contribution \[ **Source 10**\]. \[Impact period: 2020\] 

 Some relevant events and public awards that have enhanced public awareness of the research:

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at Middlesex contributed to a decrease in suicides on the London Underground Network \(LU\) through practice changes, staff training and an award\-winning public awareness campaign \[g\-1\] which “successfully changed people’s behaviour, increasing their intent to take action, as well as increasing their understanding of how to recognise that someone needs help” \[g\-2\]. Impacts in other countries \(e.g., Germany, the Netherlands\) and contexts \(including other public places and Criminal Justice settings\) followed. Universities UK recognised Dr Marzano as a “Nation's Lifesaver” for “saving lives and making a life\-changing difference to our health and wellbeing” \[g\-3\]. She also received a “Lifesaver Award” from Transport for London \(TfL\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 There is a suicide on the British rails approximately every 35 hours. The impact on all those affected, including family and friends, and the rail staff and fellow commuters who are present, is clearly devastating. Training transport police officers may contribute to reducing suicides on the railways by increasing knowledge, attitudes and confidence in suicide prevention \[1\]. However, the success of any preventative strategy also rests on understanding the factors influencing and discouraging the decision to attempt suicide on the railway networks, including from a lived experience perspective. The suicide\-prevention charity Samaritans, on behalf of the rail industry, commissioned research at Middlesex to increase understanding of why people take their lives on the railways to fill an important evidence gap both nationally and internationally. 

 The research was carried out between March 2015 and October 2016. It involved an online survey \(N=1,804\) and qualitative interviews with individuals who had contemplated or attempted suicide by train \(N=34\) \[2\]. To explore what behaviours might immediately precede a suicide or attempted suicide at a railway location, first\-person accounts of suicidality on the railways were also analysed alongside CCTV footage of individuals who died by Railway Suicide \(RS\) \(N=16\) \[3\]. 

 To maximize its impact, this work was supported from the outset by an expert advisory group, and clear plans were formed to enable dissemination of findings to closely\-identified practice, policy and academic audiences. This included efforts to raise awareness of the study during the data collection phase \(e.g., to rail employees via the bi\-monthly Suicide Prevention Report issued by the Rail Industry Suicide Stakeholder Group \(RISSG\), and through an online blog \(posted September 2015\) hosted by Middlesex for wider dissemination \[g\-4\]\). 

 <ins>Key findings of the research:</ins> 

-  Factors contributing to an individual choosing the railway as a suicide method included: perception of quick and certain lethality, ease of access, familiarity of the site, avoiding intervention, influence of the media \(reinforcing lethality\) and announcements acting as a trigger \[2\]. 

-  Key deterrents against RS were its traumatic impact on others \(especially train drivers\), the possibility of surviving with injuries, and of being interrupted by a bystander \[2\]. 

-  A third of the RS attempts described by survey participants were impulsive and influenced by their immediate surroundings \[2\]. 

-  Several behaviours may be identifiable in the moments leading up to a suicide or suicide attempt on the railways, which present opportunities for intervention: station hopping and platform switching, limiting contact with others, positioning oneself at the ‘incoming’ end of the track, allowing trains to pass by and carrying out repetitive behaviours \[3\]. 

 These findings open up possibilities for influencing suicidal behaviour based on dissuasion and reducing cognitive availability \(e.g., via responsible media reporting\), in addition to preventative measures to restrict access to means and delay impulsive behaviour \(e.g., via third\-party interventions\).

###  4.  Details of the impact 

 The underpinning research generated new evidence of why and how individuals attempt suicide on the railways. This work has been described by railway stakeholders as “seminal” \[a\] and “a watershed moment \[…which\] shaped thinking about rail\-related suicides and their management” \[b\]. Our findings have led to a series of suicide prevention activities coordinated by RSSG, Transport for London \(TfL\), and Samaritans, contributing to a significant decrease in suicides on the LU \[c\], and increase in life\-saving interventions at railway locations by staff and members of the public \[b, d\]. 

####  Fewer suicides on the LU and other changes in policy and practice influenced and informed by Middlesex research 

 In 2018 TfL rolled out a suicide prevention training course for staff \[c\], based on our research insights on how suicidal people behave at rail locations \[3\]. To date, 4,200 individuals, 59% of all TfL station staff, have received such training. This training programme has been associated with an unprecedented drop in suicide of a third in two years \(the first two\-year consecutive drop for almost twenty years, and one of the lowest levels of completed suicide on the London Underground network \(LU\) in recent times, despite a rise in the UK suicide rate by all methods\) \[c\]. At the same time, staff\-led interventions almost doubled, and changes were introduced to the LU CCTV review system to operate in a more evidence\-informed fashion \(e.g., TfL have built a framework to assess incidents based on different types of ‘pre\-suicidal’ behaviour identified by our research, which is being used to identify longer\-term trends and novel prevention strategies, in consultation with the research team\) \[c\]. In recognition of the impact of the research on suicide rates on the LU, the PI received a “Lifesaver Award” by TfL in 2019. 

 Our research also influenced changes in practice within the British Transport Police \(BTP\). These include the gathering of more relevant information in relation to rail fatalities and crisis interventions, in turn leading to several important insights. Significant changes in operational focus followed \(e.g., changes to police visibility and patrol patterns in the immediate aftermath of a RS to prevent further incidents and increase the likelihood, and perceived likelihood, of intervention \[3\]\) \[please see corroborating evidence from BTP \[a\] for full details\]. 

 Our work has also been commended for “continuing to shape the \[rail\] industry's relationship with its long\-term partner, Samaritans” \[b\]. For example, based on our work in this area \[1\-3\], we have developed and delivered training to Samaritans staff who train rail employees \(over 20,000 to date\) on how to identify, approach and support a potentially suicidal person \(September 2020\) \[d\]. Our findings \[2\] also underpin Samaritans’ guidelines for responsible reporting of rail suicide \[d\], and featured in Samaritans’ \(as well as the rail industry’s\) submissions to the Health Select Committee Suicide Prevention \[g\-5\] and the Transport Committee Rail Safety Inquiry \[g\-6\]. 

####  ‘Small Talk Saves Lives’: influencing life\-saving interventions on the GB railway network and beyond 

 *Small Talk Saves Lives* \[g\-1\] is an award\-winning media campaign launched in November 2017 \(with a further three phases since then, and a fifth one due in the Spring of 2021\). It was developed by Samaritans and RSSG, with direct and ongoing input from the research team, because of our finding that suicidal thoughts at railway locations are often temporary, and suicidal behaviours frequently impulsive and deterred \(or at least interrupted\) by the presence and intervention of third parties \(be it simply by a smile or brief exchange\) \[2\].The campaign used real\-life examples of how people had used small talk to intervene and save someone’s life, following piloting with commuters, the general public and people with lived experience of suicidality. 

 A total of 47 awareness events were organised at stations across the country to launch *Small Talk Saves Lives*. An impressive amount of media coverage followed, with 341 items appearing across broadcast \(e.g., BBC Breakfast interview with Marzano\), print and online media, creating more than 158 million opportunities for people to see or hear the campaign’s messages \[b, d\]. Importantly, the campaign “demonstrated real impact, with 74% of the public more likely to intervene and help someone after seeing the campaign” \[g\-7\]. Data recorded by the BTP showed that the number of ‘life\-saving interventions’ made by members of the public on the GB railway network in the month the campaign was launched was over three times higher than in the previous month \[g\-8\]. As a result, the campaign and our research featured in the Fourth Progress Report of the Cross\-Government Outcomes Strategy to Save Lives \(2019\), for “successfully changing people’s behaviour, increasing their intent to take action, as well as increasing their understanding of how to recognise that someone needs help, and knowledge of how to intervene safely” \[g\-2\]. 

 Following the success of *Small Talk Saves Lives*, a campaign to involve the public in suicide prevention on the railways was launched in the Netherlands \[e\] and Germany \[f\], and in 2019 the Thames Water Safety Forum also signed up to build on *Small Talk Saves Lives*, as part of a new Drowning Prevention Strategy. Current plans to translate the campaign for use in Japan will further increase its reach and impact, alongside our active involvement with the *Safer Public Spaces Network* \[g\-9\] \(e.g., we are currently replicating key elements of the underpinning research in relation to coastal locations \(with funding from Public Health England\) and road\-related methods \(with Highways England\) to explore how best to support people in crisis at these and other public locations\). 

 In addition, our findings about the role of bystanders in suicide prevention \[2\] led to the commissioning of further contract research to increase understanding of third\-party interventions, also from the perspective of those making \(or withholding\) such interventions. A team led by the PI carried out a programme of research \(funded by the rail industry\) between 2018 and 2020, for which it was recognised by Universities UK as a “Nation's Lifesaver”, one of “the top 100 individuals or groups based in universities across the country whose work is saving lives and making a life\-changing difference to our health and wellbeing” \[g\-3\]. This work was in turn the catalyst for plans to train 16,000 Barristers working in England and Wales in suicide prevention, and on this basis, was brought to the attention of all members of the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary of England and Wales \(e.g., via an article in the April 2020 edition of the Mental Health Journal\). By extension, this could have a profound impact for the many thousands of litigants who access the Justice System. 

####  Impact on policy and practice around suicide\-related communications 

 Our research showed that people often attempt RS because of an inaccurate perception \(fuelled by news and online sites\) of quick and certain lethality \[2\]. Therefore, tackling exaggerated perceptions of lethality may help reduce suicides by train. To take forward this research recommendation, a Task and Finish Group \(chaired by BTP\) was set up in August 2016 \(until August 2017\), and two workshops were carried out with experts from a range of fields and industries \(January and July 2017\). As a result of these, the Rail Safety Standards Board \(RSSB\) Annual Safety Performance Report now includes data \(not previously released to the public\) about non\-fatal suicide attempts on the railways, and BTP have altered their official communication strategy for suspected suicides and injurious attempts, to influence public discourse around the perceived lethality of the railways \(e.g., press releases or social media updates are no longer issued regarding suspected suicides and attempts, unless the person survives \[a\]\). Based on our finding that railway suicidality can be triggered by suicide\-related communications \[2\], TfL also recently reviewed their station and social media announcements of suicidal behaviour on the LU \(now changed to “casualties on the tracks”, to avoid drawing attention to fatalities\), and in 2019 Network Rail commissioned further research and consultation to explore the potential impact of station signage and announcements \[b\]. This has in turn led to a ‘Dissuasion Campaign’ \(due to be launched in 2021\) to deter people from attempting suicide by train. 

 Similarly, our research influenced a number of strategic decisions around how, when, and to whom suicidal behaviour on the railway is communicated in the Netherlands \[e\], where suicides by train decreased by 10% in 2019. This includes public communications about suicide attempts on the rails that did not result in death, whilst sharing as little as possible about fatalities \(to tackle perceptions of effectiveness\), as well as media stories to highlight the impact of suicide by train on others, in particular drivers and other staff \(because identified by our research as a major deterrent against this method\).

 Digital technology research at the University of Leicester has provided novel solutions to mitigate in\-flight damage to satellites in space by migrating tasks to non\-damaged parts of the system, thus extending flight time. The impact of the research is three\-fold. First, **economic impact** from significantly extending the flight time of satellite systems; second, through **understanding and awareness** by addressing a gap in the current space qualification process of the European Space Agency; third, through training and **knowledge transfer** to the space industry. The beneficiaries of the impact include international space agencies \(e.g. UK, European and Pakistan\) and the UK space industry.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The University of Leicester \(UoL\) is at the forefront of advancing space systems and there has been ongoing research in the area of digital technology since Professor Tanya Vladimirova joined the University in 2011. 

 The cost of space flight and satellites is extremely high. Extending a satellite’s flight time has huge economic impact by helping to spread the enormous costs across a greater time span. Operating conditions in space are harsh; there are several threats to the effective flight time of satellites and this is an on\-going area of research and development. Vacuum force can damage exposed equipment and render it non\-functional. Temperatures can vary greatly\(\-100 to \+240°C\) depending on orientation to the Sun. Meteorite impact can puncture outer skins and collide with delicate on\-board equipment. Whilst such impacts are rare, the rising levels of manmade objects \(space junk or debris\) are increasing the chances of collisions. Finally, radiation damage is probably the most significant threat, especially to sensitive equipment \(sensors, computers, guidance systems, etc.\) and can render almost all instruments useless. The focus of this research has been to extend the flight time of satellites by addressing—and mitigating the effects of—some of these threats. 

 **High\-Performance Embedded Computing Systems** 

 Current and future space missions demand highly reliable, high\-performance embedded computing **\[R1, R2\]**. No solution has existed which efficiently meets both the requirements of reliability and high\-performance computing **\[R2\]**. By working with Airbus Defence and Space, Toulouse \(2011\-2014\), a novel, distributed fault management system was proposed, together with a new approach to task\-oriented, fault\-tolerant, distributed computing \(FTDC\) **\[R3, R4\]**, for use on board spacecraft. The fault\-management functionality and seamless adaptability of the distributed system is supported by a newly designed adaptive middleware for fault\-tolerance \(AMFT\) block, which is external to the node\-processing unit and operates in parallel with it. This is the first work that addresses fault management by migrating tasks to other healthy units in a distributed system. 

 **Improving Reliability of Satellite Data Processing Systems** 

 Increased processing capabilities are required for payload data processing on board spacecrafts. In a technology assessment, NASA scientists found that static random\-access memory \(SRAM\)\-based field\-programmable gate arrays \(FPGAs\) are best suited for hardware acceleration of high\-performance tasks. This is owing to their flexibility, parallel architecture, and embedded digital signal processing \(DSP\) blocks, compared to single\-board computers and DSP processors. However, all modern SRAM\-based FPGAs are prone to nondestructive radiation effects **\[R5\]** regardless of their grading \(space, defence, or commercial\). When dealing with such FPGAs in space applications, the common types of faults that must be mitigated are caused by single\-event upsets \(SEUs\) that can change the state of a bistable element. SEUs are triggered by heavy ions and protons and result from ionization by a single energetic particle or the nuclear reaction products of an energetic proton. By working with the European Space Agency and Airbus Defence and Space, Stevenage \(2012\-2015\), Vladimirova proposed a novel, distributed\-failure detection method **\[R6\]** that applies fault detection, isolation, and recovery methods to multi\-FPGA systems by shifting failure detection mechanisms to a higher intercommunication network level.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Extending the Flight Time of Satellite Systems** 

 Building, launching, and maintaining a satellite is very expensive. The cost of building a satellite can vary from USD200,000,000 to in excess of USD400,000,000. Launching a satellite can cost in the region of USD50,000,000 – 400,000,000, although a launch vehicle may be capable of carrying several satellites, thus spreading the cost. Finally, annual maintenance cost varies between USD400,000 to 1,500,000. Clearly, extending the functional life of a satellite spreads these huge costs over a greater time\-period, helping to make them more cost\-effective and economical. 

 Vladimirova’s research into extending flight times of satellites was in collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space in Toulouse, France, within the EU FP7 project ReVuS \(2011\-2014\), with economic impact through to 2020. Based on the innovative distributed fault\-management system **\[R3, R4\]**, Airbus was provided with a novel architecture for computing systems for on board spacecraft applications, which offers both highly\-reliable operation and high\-performance data processing capability. This provides an **economic benefit** to the company as it allows the flight time of their space systems to be increased: *“The impact is in the form of increased understanding and awareness of intra\-satellite fault\-tolerant distributed computing as a new capability, providing a robust response of on\-board computing systems to debris impact and extending spacecraft lifetime”* **\[E1\]**. The work received a commendation from Airbus: “ *\[T\]he contribution of the University of Leicester was the most innovative outcome of the ReVuS project*” **\[E1\]**. 

 A further impact from the research was in terms of training and **knowledge transfer**. The National Space Agency of Pakistan \(SUPARCO\) has used the research to help develop their real space missions: *“The impact is in the form of increased understanding and awareness and addresses a gap in the current on board computer design enabling a high computational performance and a high reliability. Elements of the proposed methods have been successfully demonstrated in flight on board the recent Pakistan Technology Evaluation Satellite PakTES\-1A, developed by SUPARCO, which was launched on the 9<sup>th</sup> July 2018”* **\[E2\]**. Further impact through knowledge transfer has benefited the space company, STAR\-Dundee in Scotland, an aerospace engineering company focused on spacecraft on\-board data\-handling and processing technology, delivering a comprehensive range of test and development equipment, chip designs, and IP cores to the world’s space agencies and international aerospace industry. STAR’s Chief Technology Officer stated: *“Examples of significant contributions* \[from working with UoL\] *are: a novel distributed fault\-tolerance management scheme based on a new approach to task oriented fault\-tolerant distributed computing \(FTDC\) on board spacecraft, a new adaptive middleware design supporting task migration in case of a failure that is external to the processing unit, a novel scalable and efficient Multiprocessor System\-on\-a­ Chip \(MPSoC\) based FTDC hardware platform, which was fully demonstrated though a near ­realistic prototype of an FTDC Attitude and Orbit Control System \(AOCS\) computer for use on board satellites*” **\[E3\]**. 

 Thus, this significant work has achieved both national and international reach. The work has been prototyped in the context of educational pico\- and nano\-satellites, such as CubeSats. A CubeSat \(U\-class spacecraft\), a type of miniaturized satellite for space research that is made up of multiples of 10cm × 10cm × 11.35cm cubic units, have a mass of no more than 1.33 kilograms \(2.9lb\) per unit, and often use commercial off\-the\-shelf \(COTS\) components for their electronics and structure. 

 **Addressing a Gap in the Current Space Qualification Process** 

 The novel research at UoL, reported in **\[R5, R6\]**, has provided the European Space Agency, along with Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, UK \(2012\-2015\), with initial design and implementation of technology aimed at improving fault diagnostics and recovery schemes for instrument data processing systems \(payloads\) on board satellites. The research at UoL has led to a new SEU mitigation technique for use in space\-borne static random\-access memory field\-programmable gate arrays \(SRAM FPGAs\). The impact is in the form of **increased understanding and awareness** and **addresses a gap in the current space qualification process of the European Space Agency** **\[E4, E5\]**: *“The novel solutions developed as a result of the project address real needs of fault tolerant data processing on board spacecraft and have undoubtedly influenced design practices within ESA”* **\[E5\]**. Whilst the specific research was aimed directly at space/satellite applications, as an indication of the future potential impact, this diagnostic approach is also applicable to mission\-critical applications in the automobile and nuclear industries. 

 A further impact from the research into testing and validating systems incorporating SRAM\-based FPGAs was in terms of knowledge transfer into the payload division of **the European Space Research and Technology Centre** \(ESTEC\) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, which is the largest ESA site. ESTEC is the incubator of the European space effort, where most ESA projects are born and where they are guided through the various phases of development. Additionally, ESA were so interested in the work that they sponsored a proton irradiation test campaign worth EUR10,000 \(10\-2020\), which was carried out at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland, to validate the proposed fault detection, isolation and recovery technique \(FDIR\) **\[E5\]**. 

 There has also been knowledge transfer between UoL and Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, UK, **\[E4\]** and Cobham Gaisler in Gotenburg Sweden **\[E6\]**, who specialise in providing IP cores and supporting development tools for embedded processors based on the SPARC architecture, and are a recognised provider of digital hardware solutions for both commercial and aerospace applications. As a direct result of the ESA/Airbus Defence and Space project **\[G2\]**, Cobham Gaisler employed Dr Felix Siegle, a member of the UoL team, who gained transferable knowledge that enabled him to become “ *a valuable member of the team”* who *“made a significant lasting contribution to our activities. For example, Dr Felix Siegle contributed substantially to the SpaceWire and SpaceFibre projects*” **\[E6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Cardiff Met has enhanced the use of technology in teaching modern languages nationally and internationally. Funded by grants totaling €804K, two phases of the Interactive Technologies in Language Teaching \(ITiLT\) project impacted the communicative language teaching and pedagogical practice of over 9,300 educators benefitting an estimated 50,000 pupils and students across Europe and Eurasia. Course materials were produced in 6 languages and 1,327 teaching practitioners attended ITiLT workshops. ITiLT was designated as a ‘Success Story’ by Erasmus\+, a category reserved for projects that have distinguished themselves by their impact, contribution to policy\-making, innovative results or creative approach, and that might be a source of inspiration to others.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Background and context 

 It has been widely acknowledged for some time that technology has the *potential* to foster better communication and more interactive and effective pedagogical practice. This potential is not often realised, and where teachers have used technology, its use can best be depicted as ‘technical interactivity’, rather than the ‘pedagogical interactivity’ needed to promote effective learning. On joining Cardiff Met in 2007, Beauchamp had recently completed a £114,794 ESRC and British Educational Communications and Technology Agency \(BECTA\) \-funded research project, examining how technology might best be deployed to develop interactive teaching. Beauchamp subsequently used the findings of this work to develop an analysis framework to assess how effectively teachers use of Information and Communication Technology \(ICT\) in teaching practice, with a particular focus on Interactive Whiteboards \(IWB\). The results revealed considerable variation in the effectiveness of technology use in classrooms and the potential of classroom video recording as a facilitator of reflective dialogue centred on effective practice with teachers. Similar issues around the use of ICT in language teaching classrooms across Europe provided the impetus for Beauchamp’s invitation to join Phase 1 of the Interactive Technologies in Language Teaching \(ITiLT\) project between 2011 and 2013, facilitated by a €525,945 Erasmus\+ programme grant that also funded Abbinett’s appointment as an RA. The success of that work led to an additional EU grant of €278,252 for Phase 2 of ITiLT between 2014 and 2017. The primary aim of Phase 2 was to enhance the effective use of a wider range of technologies in task\-based language teaching to improve language educators’ efficacy with technology and its use in their pedagogical practice \[R1\]. 

 Outcomes 

 Through its European partnerships in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Turkey and Spain, ITiLT research culminated in a range of resources related to use of technology for the professional development of classroom teachers and university lecturers. The research revealed a lack of confidence in using interactive technologies that caused many teachers and lecturers to only use a very limited set of ICT features to support learning. Some were more confident in the technical use of interactive technologies but less confident in developing new pedagogic approaches to exploit ICT’s full potential \[R2\]. ITiLT underpinned the development of rubrics for participant configuration and orchestration of learning \[R3, R4, R5\]. The project identified that the predominant patterns of classroom organisation were educator, rather than learner\-centred, particularly in the case of younger learners. This insight enabled the development of a video coding framework for analysing IWB\-mediated language teaching and the use of technology tools/features \[R6\]. Beauchamp and Abbinett consequently advocated a shift towards a greater role for lecturers, teachers and learners in schools in orchestrating resources in the classroom and concluded that there is potential for educators and learners to come to  shared realisation of the pedagogic potential of interactive technologies in teaching and learning \[R1\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Beauchamp** and **Abbinett’s** work fundamentally changed the pedagogical use of technology in language teaching in seven countries spanning Europe and Eurasia, reaching well over 9,300 educational practitioners and student teachers \[E1\]. Resources from the ITiLT project have been produced in six different languages, namely French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Turkish and English. The final Erasmus\+ assessment report of ITiLT concluded that “There is substantial evidence of impact on participants and their organisations at local and wider levels” \[E2\]. ITiLT was independently evaluated at 88/100 and designated as a ‘Success Story’ by Erasmus\+, a category reserved for projects that have distinguished themselves by their impact, contribution to policy\-making, innovative results or creative approach, and that might be a source of inspiration to others \[E3\]. 

 The final report for Phase 1 of the project concluded that “the whole team has reached over **9,300** people with their dissemination activities’ over seven countries” \[E2\]. The Phase 2 final report \(2017\) concluded that there had been an impact on “a minimum of nearly **1700** students in five countries to date” and “potential for over **500** more each successive year” \[E4\]. Multiplier events – during which educators trained other teachers in using the technology – increased the research’s reach: “In total, at least **1,327** attended all dissemination events by partners, and online hits were **36,013** for these events, in addition to **82,000** on Scoop.it.**Footnote:**

 Scoop.it is a content engine that monitors global sources to find and curate relevant third\-party content. 
” \[E4\]. The Project lead of Phase 1 estimated that, based on an average class size of 25, over a period of 3 to 4 years, the learning of more than 50,000 students had been impacted \[E5\]. 

 Evaluations of multiplier events completed by classroom teachers internationally showed a series of positive impacts: 

-  95% agreed that *‘I found the event valuable to support my professional development’*; 

-  91% agreed that *'The event has given me ideas that I can use in my classroom’*; 

-  89% agreed that *‘The event has given me ideas that I can share with my colleagues’*; 

 ITiLT mainly reached educators in higher education, in\-service and pre\-service classroom language teachers, and teacher educators who needed pedagogical support for the design and implementation of technology\-enhanced language lessons. The active involvement of teachers, pupils and lecturers as real collaborators in planning, delivering and recording their lessons, has ensured that ITiLT resources definitively affected teachers’ thinking and pedagogical practice: “This hands\-on and yet solid approach was and is still inspiring to me in my teaching practice.” \[E6\]. The ‘research\-based pedagogy’ has proven especially valuable with education researchers who are training the next generation of educators. For example, a Durham University Professor reported: “I have been able to pass on these developments to over **600 initial teacher education students** in my teaching at Durham. I have also been able to demonstrate and inform over **400 teachers in Norway** through a collaboration with the Norwegian Business School \(BI\) in Oslo” and *“*\[ITiLT has\] altered the way that I have approached the use of IWBs in the classroom, and how I support future teachers in the use of IWBs in the classroom” \[E7\]. 

 The project’s website \[E8\] has been made available beyond the end of the project. It has been used by teaching practitioners in Europe, North America, Australia and Turkey. The website hosts: 

-  117 video examples of the use of interactive technologies in second\-language teaching; 

-  a comprehensive professional development e\-resource, including a series of mini\-guides; and 

-  an extensive online library. 

 These resources continue to be widely used. A *Université Côte d’Azur* Professor has personally used it in the teaching of between 500 and 800 students: *“*\[I have\] used the website in pre\- and in\-service teacher education with undergraduate classes \(25\-80 students in third\-year English from 2011 onwards\) and masters’ classes for pre\-service primary and secondary teachers \(50\-80 students per year since 2011\). To my knowledge the ITILT project websites are used by colleagues at other French universities \(Université Grenoble\-Alpes\) and I have also used them in workshops \(Ireland2017, Norway 2018, French universities and school authorities from 2011\) and webinars \(Germany 2013, 2016, Canada 2014, Belgium 2017, UK 2018\) attracting an average of around 50 participants.” \[E9\] 

 Web resources are also shared through professional bodies and networks such as European Schoolnet, a not\-for\-profit network of 34 European Ministries of Education which supports schools and teachers to bring innovation in teaching and learning with a particular focus on ICT and digitization \[E5\] and which features ITiLT prominently on its webpages \[E10\]. 

 In summary, ITiLT has had a significant impact on language educators across Europe, transforming their teaching practice and promoting enhanced learning for tens of thousands of pupils and students.

###  **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Waiton has delivered impact in the areas of the ‘policing’ and criminalisation of everyday life, with particular reference to the Scottish context. 

 Waiton’s research identified the development of ‘risk’\-based practices in Scotland that undermined the autonomy of families. This research contributed significantly to the repeal of the Scottish Government’s Named Person initiative, which breached human rights laws on privacy, lacked a clear definition of ‘wellbeing’, and unreasonably expanded state intervention into the family unit. The Supreme Court ruled against the Named Person initiative in July 2016. 

 Waiton’s research showed that Football fans were being over\-criminalised as a result of the targeted and prejudicial nature of the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act in Scotland.  His research contributed significantly to the repeal of the act in March 2018 on the basis that the act excessively expanded the criminalisation of language and discriminated against football fans. 
","
###  **2. Underpinning research** 

####  **Overview** 

 Waiton’s research provides original and significant insights into the ‘policing’ and criminalisation of everyday life. His work stems from the observation that life is increasingly policed by public authorities \(in particular the state\) which progressively expand their policing processes into various areas of social life, subsuming a broader range of normal, everyday social actions and relations under categories of deviance or even crime. The idea that the state becomes increasingly involved in the micro\-management of everyday life, is what the German sociologist Habermas called the ‘colonisation of the lifeworld’. 

 Waiton’s qualitative research combines wider sociological theories and action research with public service users and stakeholders to study the ‘policing’ and criminalisation of everyday private life. It combines a socio\-legal analysis with political sociology to address the construction of social problems of everyday life, engaging stakeholders and newly formed, sometimes temporary, social movements. Waiton’s research also has international relevance at a theoretical level through its conceptualisation of the ‘new class’ \(understood here to be the new political and cultural elites and the bureaucracy that sustains it\), their changing values and subsequent changes in the nature of the state and to law. This new managerial form of governing enacted by the ‘new class’ focuses on micro\-management of relationships in society and has been assisted by the largely unquestioned rise of therapeutic responses, focused on the emotional well\-being of the public as a basis for creating a better society **\[3.1\]**. 

####  **Named Person Scheme** 

 The Named Person scheme was a Scottish Government initiative to give every child in Scotland an assigned named person from birth who would be responsible for helping the child get support if and when they needed it. Whilst predicated on increasing the well\-being of children in the country, this initiative is an example of the state micro\-management and colonisation of everyday life, with policy makers becoming increasingly concerned about the relationship between parents and children. The Named Person initiative would have transformed the basis of data sharing and in part, state intervention, from a risk/welfare framework to one based on the far broader idea of early intervention to ‘promote the wellbeing’ of all children and young people. As a new universal approach to child safety and children’s services more generally, the potential impact of the Named Person scheme on families and professionals working with families across Scotland was significant. A range of parent and professional groups opposed this expanding role of the state into family life. 

 Waiton’s research highlighted the developing ‘risk’\-based practices emerging in Scotland that undermined autonomy through a therapeutic governing of families **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. The work interlinked theoretical arguments with participation research developed with parents’ groups.  Waiton developed a conceptual understanding of the ‘well\-being state’ through a documentary analysis of family policies, with specific reference to the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Act 2014 **\[3.3\]**. This research builds upon Waiton’s approach to ‘amoral panics’, the growth of risk management in family policies, and the development of professional ‘experts’ of parenting. It examines how parental authority and autonomy are undermined by ‘early intervention’ initiatives and the ‘new authoritarianism’ apparent in the creation of the Named Person policy **\[3.4\]**. This work highlighted the disjuncture between policy makers and parents, the problematic and ill\-defined transformation of the welfare state to what was defined here as ‘Third Way Parenting’ – a new type of micro\-management of everyday private life. 

####  **Offensive Behaviour at Football Act** 

 The Offensive Behaviour at Football Act expanded the policing of language in Scotland specifically in relation to football fans. This is another relevant example of the criminalisation of everyday life. Waiton’s research showed that fans were being over\-criminalised as a result of the targeted and prejudicial nature of the new act, which undermined the universality and legitimacy of law. Furthermore, the research developed an understanding of a new form of intra\-fan ‘sectarianism’ that elevated the alleged intolerance of ‘offended’ fans in response to the Act. 

  

 Waiton engaged in participation action research with football fans to address the problem of discriminatory policing and the over\-regulation of language.  He analysed online fan discussions to develop a new understanding of the role played by the criminalisation of language in creating new types of ‘offensiveness’ through which sectarian rivalries were articulated. 

 This work highlighted the move away from the policing of physical violence to the policing of words, now conceived as acts of violence. Emphasis was given to understanding the role of the ‘elites’ in the moralisation of public discourse around the issue of sectarianism and offence **\[3.5\]**. The research demonstrated how the specific targeting of football fans’ language, rather than the language of ‘cultural producers’, as a criminal offence carrying a potential penalty of five years in prison, undermined the universal basis of law **\[3.6\]**.

###  **4. Details of the impact** 

####  **Key impacts** 

 Waiton’s Named Person research contributed significantly to the repeal of the Scottish Government’s initiative which breached human rights laws on privacy and unreasonably expanded state intervention into the family unit. The UK Supreme Court ruled against the Scottish Government in July 2016 **\[5.1\]**. 

 Waiton’s research into the criminalisation of football fans, in collaboration with football fan groups, contributed significantly to the repeal of the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act in Scotland, helping to demonstrate that the act excessively expanded the criminalisation of language and discriminated against football fans. The act was repealed by the Scottish Parliament in March 2018 **\[5.2\]**. 

####  **Named Person impact** 

 In June 2013, Waiton gave an oral submission to the Education and Culture Committee on policies regarding children at risk, and in August 2013 he produced a written submission regarding the Named Person section of the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Bill.  He then coordinated a meeting of stakeholders in the Named Person scheme at the Scottish Parliament with MSP Liz Smith, who later commended him for his “ *excellent*” research into well\-being **\[5.3\]**.  He was also invited to speak to Scottish Conservative MSPs at the Scottish Parliament about the Named Person initiative **\[5.3\]**. 

 In December 2013, Waiton’s research was referenced in the Scottish Parliament regarding discussions about the repeal of the Named Person aspect of the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Act 2014. MSP and Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, Ken Macintosh noted that Waiton had usefully argued in his submissions that: 

 ‘*the bureaucratisation of adult\-child relationships has undermined our ability to exercise personal judgment*’ **\[5.4\]**. 

 In 2014, helped by MSP Liz Smith, Waiton set up a meeting with interested parties that opposed the Named Person legislation.  This led to the creation of the campaign group ‘Say No to the Named Person Scheme’ \(NO2NP\). NO2NP believed that the legislation would undermine parents’ responsibility over their own children and allow state officials unprecedented powers to interfere with family life. Waiton organised several public discussions as part of the NO2NP group and chaired or spoke at 12 roadshows across Scotland: around 500 people attended the meetings.  A petition against the Named Person was also established and received 37,000 signatures. 

 Throughout the campaign \(2014\-2016\), Waiton was the most publicly cited academic within the media having written several newspaper articles about the Named Person initiative, appeared on numerous television and radio programmes and named in 50 articles about the subject **\[5.5\]**.  He was a board member of the NO2NP campaign established to influence strategy and through this, conferences, roadshows and media work became the most influential academic within the social movements opposing the Named Person. 

 In July 2016, the Supreme Court ruled against the Scottish Government’s Named Person scheme.  They ruled that the establishment of a Named Person scheme would breach data protection laws and that a more coherent concept of wellbeing needed to be defined \(both aspects highlighted in Waiton’s work\) **\[5.1\]**. Education secretary John Swinney initially pushed for a new information sharing bill, but eventually conceded defeat and repealed the Named Person provision of the Children and Young People \(Scotland\) Act 2014, as required by the Supreme Court. 

 In October 2016, the NO2NP campaign won the Glasgow Herald’s ‘Public Campaign of the Year’. 

 The impact of the repeal of the act has been significant. For parent groups and professional organisations this has meant an improvement in professional practices and services through a more positive approach to families and the limiting of unnecessary interventions and breaches of privacy. A survey of health visitors, for example found that more than half opposed the Named Person scheme. 

 In 2018, Dr Waiton’s research into the Named Person’s scheme \(specifically around the definition and understanding of the term ‘wellbeing’, human rights laws on privacy and the problematic nature of data sharing\) was incorporated into the Palgrave Handbook of Education Law for Schools **\[5.6\]**. 

####  **Offensive Behaviour at Football impact** 

 A combination of Waiton’s participatory action research with football fans, written work \(both academic and in the media\), and his submissions to the Scottish Parliament contributed to the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communication \(Scotland\) Bill being overturned in 2018 **\[5.2\]**. 

 In Sept 2011, Dr Waiton was an invited witness in the Scottish Parliament to provide an oral submission on the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communication \(Scotland\) Bill **\[5.7\]**.  As a result of his submission and the response to it by football fans, Waiton undertook new participatory action research with football fans to explore the problem of discriminatory policing and the over\-regulation of language in relation to football **\[3.6\].** 

 In November 2017, Waiton was invited to give a second oral submission to the Parliamentary committee **\[5.8\]** and his written submission was used as evidence in MSP James Kelly’s statement proposing the repeal of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications \(Scotland\) Act **\[5.9\]**. 

 In Jan 2018, the Scottish Parliament held a debate on the repealing of the Act.  Waiton’s arguments regarding tolerance and freedom of speech were used in the Scottish Parliament as part of the challenge to the Offensive Behaviour Act. During the debate, MSP Gordon Lindhurst noted: 

 *‘Inventing a reasonable person and thereby an arbitrary threshold as to what is offensive is itself, in this context, an unacceptable limit on freedom of expression. Indeed, Dr Stuart Waiton said that the 2012 act criminalises “words and thoughts’* **\[5.10\]**. 

 In March 2018, the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act was repealed by the Scottish Parliament.   Maurice Corry MSP stated, during this session that the illiberal position was accurately described by Dr Stuart Waiton: the act criminalises “words and thoughts” **\[5.2\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 University of Southampton \(UoS\) research has made seminal contributions to understanding the pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Investigating the structure and function of the tumour B\-cell receptor provided the mechanistic rationale for the first tumour\-eradicating cures in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and the development of targeted therapies that have achieved annual sales of more than GBP5 billion following regulatory approval during the impact period. Research into sequencing immunoglobulin genes resulted in new prognostic tools that were adopted as a standard of care by the NHS and in international guidelines for informing treatment selection. Leadership of large\-scale clinical trials applying molecular phenotyping and functional imaging led to adoption of response\-adapted therapy as the international standard of care in Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal lymphoma. It defined the optimum approach for antibody therapy in follicular lymphoma, resulting in further GBP billions of drug sales. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 University of Southampton research has provided novel insights into the pathogenesis, prognosis and treatment of two blood cancers: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia \(CLL\), the most common leukaemia with 3,700 new cases in the UK each year, and lymphoma, the fifth most prevalent cancer in the UK, with more than 14,000 new diagnoses annually. The new knowledge has been used to shape new standards of care internationally, develop new therapeutic drugs and optimise these treatments through clinical trials. 

 **Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia** 

 Stevenson and Hamblin were the first to identify two distinct immunogenetic subsets of CLL: Unmutated CLL \( **U\-CLL**\) and Mutated CLL \( **M\-CLL**\). U\-CLL derives from B cells prior to entry to the germinal centre and carries no somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin \(Ig\) variable region genes. M\-CLL derives from B cells that have traversed this site and accumulated mutations. U\-CLL is the more aggressive subset, affecting 40% of CLL patients and having a mean survival of 8 years, compared to 25 years for M\-CLL. Research \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] into biological processes underlying disease behaviour showed that the subsets differ in conformational structure and function of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region \(IGHV\) genes of the surface B\-cell receptor \(BCR\). Patients with the more aggressive U\-CLL were found to have higher levels of surface BCR engagement, and therefore responded preferentially to BCR\-mediated signals. The discovery of this prognostic marker generated widespread interest in CLL among biologists and made possible new therapeutic strategies specifically targeting these signalling pathways. 

 Studies from 2011 \[including under **G1**\], led by Forconi and Packham, demonstrated that BCR signalling is vital to malignant B cells: CLL with high signal strength show more rapid disease progression \[ **3.3**\]. Studies led by Steele between 2010 and 2020 explored the efficacy of different therapeutic treatments in interrupting this signalling. These included **ibrutinib**, a cell signal blocker that targets the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase \(BTK\) protein \[ **3.4**\], the dual Syk/JAK inhibitor cerdulatinib and PI3\-kinase inhibitor idelalisib. Recognition of the link between BCR signalling and apoptosis provided the rationale for clinical trials such as CLARITY \(with Forconi as a leading contributor\), which studied the efficacy of ibrutinib and venetoclax, a B\-cell lymphoma 2 \(BCL\-2\) inhibitor, when used in combination \(details of the results in section 4\). 

 **Hodgkin and Non\-Hodgkin Lymphoma \(NHL\)** 

 Johnson has led international trials of new treatments for lymphoma over the last two decades. Beginning in 2008, the phase 3 RATHL trial \[ **G2**\] in advanced Hodgkin lymphoma used FDG\-PET imaging to modulate therapy and demonstrated the value of interim PET\-CT scanning in guiding the intensification or de\-escalation of chemotherapy to optimise the balance between efficacy and toxicity. The results were published in 2016 \[ **3.5**\] \(further details in section 4\). Similar studies targeted primary mediastinal large B\-cell lymphoma, a fast\-growing type of NHL. Johnson and Davies led sequential phase 2 and 3 trials with the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group – IELSG 26 and IELSG 37 \[ **G3**\] – to test the utility of PET imaging to guide the need for consolidation radiotherapy \(details of the results in section 4\). 

 Since 2015 Johnson and Davies have led a national collaborative group to apply molecular phenotyping in aggressive lymphomas \[ **G4**\]. The phase 3 REMoDL\-B trial \[ **G5**\] was the first to demonstrate the value of real\-time gene expression profiling to stratify treatment for diffuse large B\-cell lymphoma \[ **3.6**; details in section 4\]. The translation of biological insights in B\-cell\-directed antibody therapy from the Southampton group led to the international phase 3 GALLIUM trial to assess the efficacy of anti\-CD20 antibody **obinutuzumab** in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma, a type of NHL. Davies led the correlative laboratory studies and identified that obinutuzumab\-based therapy resulted in longer progression\-free survival than the previous standard of **rituximab**\-based therapy \[ **3.7**; details in section 4\]. In SABRINA, another phase 3 trial in follicular lymphoma, a team led by Davies showed that rituximab given subcutaneously was as effective and safe as intravenous rituximab \(the existing standard\), thereby increasing patient convenience and reducing healthcare costs \(details in section 4\).

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research at Southampton has developed new understanding around the molecular classification and pathogenetic processes of lymphoid malignancies. This led to the development of new prognostic tools to inform the timing of early\-stage treatment, regulatory approval of ‘blockbuster’ targeted therapies and changes to standards of care via large\-scale, international clinical trials. 

 **New prognostic tools and approaches to optimise early\-stage CLL/lymphoma treatment** 

 Patients with U\-CLL have a worse prognosis than those with M\-CLL in all studies investigating the significance of IGHV mutational status, and this classification, first described and elucidated by Southampton \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\], is the dominant prognostic factor out of all those studied. This was confirmed in a 2016 meta\-analysis of data from 4,933 patients with early\-stage CLL, leading to the publication of an international prognostic index for CLL patients: CLL\-IPI \[ **5.1**\]. This tool stratifies CLL patients into four risk categories \(ensuring high\-risk patients are identified early\) and provides a score to estimate prognosis and time to first treatment. It was published on MDCalc \[ **5.2**\], the most broadly used medical reference for clinical decision tools \(including by 65% of US physicians\). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) updated its clinical practice guidelines in 2020 \[ **5.2**\]; it recommended IGHV mutational status analysis for CLL prior to treatment if not done at diagnosis, and repetition of the test when considering treatment with chemoimmunotherapy instead of novel BCR inhibitors. In 2018 IGHV analysis was listed as a standard in NHS England’s Genomic Test Directory for cancer \[ **5.2**\]. 

 Evidence from the UoS\-led, phase 3 REMoDL\-B trial \[ **3.6**, **G5**\] identified a subgroup of diffuse large B\-cell lymphoma \(DLBL\), *molecular high\-grade \(MHG\) lymphoma*, determined by gene expression profiling, with a clearly inferior prognosis \(progression\-free survival of 37% compared to 72% from a study of 928 patients\) \[ **5.3**\]. Published in 2019, the results identified a new patient group that can benefit from intensified chemotherapy or novel targeted therapies \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Development and approval of novel therapies targeting BCR signalling pathways** 

 A significant translational impact arising from Southampton’s insights into the centrality of BCR signalling as a prognostic marker \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] is the development and regulatory approval of new targeted therapies for CLL. The first\-in\-class ibrutinib, marketed as Imbruvica \(AbbVie and Janssen\), and the second generation acalabrutinib, marketed as Calquence \(Astrazeneca and Acerta\), specifically target BCR signalling pathways. Ibrutinib was first approved for CLL by the US FDA in 2014 and by NICE in 2017 for use on the NHS. Acalabrutinib received FDA approval in 2017 and EU approval in 2020. The clinical/patient benefits and economic impact of these BCR\-inhibitor therapies, initially derived from Southampton’s observations, has been vast, transforming CLL treatment by challenging the prior dominance of chemoimmunotherapy regimens. Annual sales revenues of ibrutinib alone reached USD7.24bn \(GBP5,460,000,000\) in 2019, with CLL the most profitable indication, while sales of acalabrutinib were USD522m \(GBP382,000,000\) in 2020 \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Clinical trials have demonstrated the significant clinical benefit of targeting BCR signalling using ibrutinib\-based regimens over immunochemotherapy, particularly for the U\-CLL group. In a phase 3 trial of previously untreated CLL receiving either ibrutinib\-based therapy or standard chemoimmunotherapy, ibrutinib\-based therapy resulted in much better progression\-free survival: 90.7% vs. 62.5% at 3 years; hazard ratio for progression or death at 3 years, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14\-0.50 \[ **5.5**\]. Southampton was the leading centre in the phase 2 CLARITY trial, reporting the remarkable efficacy and low toxicity of ibrutinib in combination with BH3\-mimetic venetoclax in patients with recurrent CLL. This combination has shown unprecedented efficacy, with eradication of the disease in more than 60% of patients. The study marked the first demonstration that combining BCR targeting with BH3 mimetics can result in molecular eradication of CLL \[ **5.6**\]. In Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, Acerta invested GBP800,000 for Southampton to carry out the phase 1/2 ACCEPT trial of acalabrutinib in combination with standard chemoimmunotherapy \(2018\) and Astrazeneca invested GBP3,200,000 in Southampton\-led phase 2 trial REMoDL\-A to to establish whether this combined approach may become the new standard of care \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **Changing standards of care and validating new treatments through large\-scale trials** 

 Southampton has led practice\-changing trials that have demonstrated the value of FDG\-PET imaging in lymphoma therapy. The phase 3 RATHL trial \[ **3.5**, **G2**\] showed that negative PET imaging after the first 2 months of treatment in **advanced Hodgkin lymphoma** could predict 5\-year progression\-free survival of 82%. For this group, the RATHL findings demonstrated that incidence of lung toxicity could be reduced without compromising cure rates by omitting the drug bleomycin, a treatment that had been used in chemotherapy for 30 years but which can cause long\-term lung damage. This finding translated into changes to clinical practice, as recommended in NHS guidelines, the 2018 European Society for Medical Oncology \(ESMO\) Guidelines and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) guidelines \[ **5.8**\]. The overall RATHL results showed 5 year survival of 95%, leading to adoption of treatment modulated according to PET results in the UK, wider Europe and US \[ **5.8**\]. 

 In **primary mediastinal lymphoma**, the international IELSG 26 trial of PET imaging led by Southampton showed 95% 5 year survival. This defined the response criteria to be used in this illness \(cited in 2016 ESMO guidelines \[ **5.9**\]\). In **follicular lymphoma**, the GALLIUM study \[ **3.7**\], for which Southampton led the correlative laboratory studies, demonstrated that progression\-free survival for patients treated with the novel anti\-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab \(80%\) was superior to that seen with the previous standard rituximab \(73%\) when given with chemotherapy. This changed practice internationally. Citing the Gallium results, the US FDA and the EU approved obinutuzumab \(tradename: Gazyva in US; Gazyvaro in Europe; Roche\) as a treatment, in combination with chemotherapy, for follicular lymphoma in 2017. In March 2018 NICE recommended obinutuzumab ‘ *as an option for untreated advanced follicular lymphoma in patients at higher risk*’ \[ **5.10**\]. This led to significant commercial impact too. As an indication, when obinutuzumab was approved with bendamustine for follicular lymphoma in 2016, the media reported a likely sales uplift for Roche of USD500m to USD1bn \[ **5.11**\]. In phase 3 UoS\-led trial SABRINA, the maintenance antibody therapy for follicular lymphoma – rituximab \(marketed by Roche as MabThera in Europe and Rituxan in US\) – was shown to be equally effective and safe when given subcutaneously as intravenously \(published in *Lancet Haematology*, 2017 \[ **5.12**\]\). This was shown to increase convenience for patients and reduce healthcare costs by 25%, from EUR1,956 per cycle to EUR1,460, or a total of EUR6,000 for the full course of treatment \[ **5.13**\]. As a direct result of SABRINA, the subcutaneous version of rituximab received approval for common forms of NHL from the EU in 2014 and the US in 2017. In 2014 NICE cited SABRINA as providing key evidence for its use \[ **5.14**\]. The commercial impact was significant; as an indication, rituximab has been one of Roche’s best\-selling drugs, with USD7.39bn \(GBP5,010,000,000\) in global sales in 2015 \[ **5.15**\] and in 2016 Roche said the subcutaneous version of MabThera had secured an average 35% market share \[ **5.16**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Prof. Kirk’s research on western flower thrips and glasshouse whiteflies has provided commercial growers of vegetable, fruit and flower crops with an effective non\-insecticide solution to the control of these major worldwide pests. Prof. Kirk’s group discovered that addition of pheromones and changes in trap appearance can increase trap catches of thrips and whiteflies. Bioline AgroSciences, Biobest Group and Russell IPM have used these significant findings to develop and sell innovative traps that reduce crop loss worldwide. These traps reduce the need for insecticides, thus reducing the risk of pesticide residues and the associated harms to the environment. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the past 25 years, the world\-leading Centre for Applied Entomology and Parasitology \(CAEP\) at Keele University has conducted research into the biology of agriculturally important insect pests that threaten food security and sustainability. CAEP has particularly focused on thrips and whiteflies, which are major pests of a wide range of crops worldwide, causing an estimated £20 billion of damage per year. The resistance of these pests to current insecticides and the growing consumer demand for chemical\-free fruit and vegetables, mean that new control methods are needed urgently to protect the world’s crops and fulfil market demand. Within CAEP, the Thrips Research Group at Keele \(Prof. William Kirk, Prof. Gordon Hamilton and Dr Clare Sampson\) has discovered new ways to increase trap catches, thus reducing pest numbers in a sustainable way and reducing the need for insecticide treatments. 

 The western flower thrips \( *Frankliniella occidentalis*\) is the most damaging species of thrips worldwide, causing feeding damage and transmitting plant diseases. In 2001, Prof. Kirk and Prof. Hamilton studied this species to discover the first aggregation pheromone in thrips \( **3.1, 3.2**\). Following this breakthrough, they identified the pheromone compounds by headspace analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. They then synthesised the pheromone and tested it in field trials in commercial greenhouses in Spain in 2004 \( **3.3**\). These trials showed that the pheromone doubled the trap catch of both males and females when added to blue or yellow sticky traps, which are already highly attractive and used commercially to monitor thrips \( **3.3**\). Further research from 2006\-2014 identified the aggregation pheromone of the melon thrips \( *Thrips palmi*\), which is an invasive pest of many crops \( **3.5**\), and research from 2014\-2019 identified the aggregation pheromone of the bean flower thrips \( *Megalurothrips sjostedti*\), which is a major pest of legume crops in sub\-Saharan Africa. 

 Field trials with the aggregation pheromone of the western flower thrips in UK strawberry crops by Dr Sampson and Prof. Kirk from 2011\-2014 developed the traps and showed that mass trapping with pheromone traps reduced pest numbers by 73%, damage by 68% and was cost\-effective for growers when used as part of an integrated pest management programme \( **3.4**\). This result was a breakthrough because mass trapping in this way was considered by many to be ineffective against abundant pests such as thrips. This research allowed Russell IPM Ltd to incorporate the pheromone in traps as a product for growers. In addition to attracting flying thrips and thus increasing trap catch, the research group showed that exposure to aggregation pheromone makes thrips more active, bringing them out of hiding places on plants, which can increase the efficacy of insecticides or biological agents. 

 From 2014\-2016, Dr Sampson, Prof. Kirk and Prof. Hamilton carried out research with Russell IPM Ltd. They developed the use of geometrical patterns on traps \(white on blue for thrips and black on yellow for whiteflies\) to double trap catches \( **3.6**\) and then went on to show that subtle changes in the shade of yellow traps, according to the relative proportions of wavelengths above and below 500 nm, rather than the absolute amounts, could also double the trap catch of whiteflies \( **3.6**\), leading to a range of new products. Trap technology for whiteflies has been unchanged for decades, so these advances in colour and pattern are major breakthroughs.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The work on thrips pheromones, trap patterns and trap colours by CAEP’s Thrips Research Group has been applied to a range of products used to control thrips and whiteflies in crops around the world. The impact of this research has reached across a range of geographical scales, from local to global, by enabling a UK\-based manufacturer to grow its business, as well as being part of the solution to securing food crops in developing countries and reducing pesticide use. 

 **Product Innovation and Business Growth** 

 The western flower thrips pheromone that Keele discovered in 2001 \( **3.1**, **3.2**\) is currently used in at least 10 different commercial products sold by Bioline AgroSciences \(formerly Syngenta Bioline\), Biobest Group and Russell IPM \( **5.1**\). In particular, the application of this research has enabled Russell IPM, an SME based in the UK, to expand their products and increase their turnover by more than £6 million from 2013 to 2018, doubling profit in that period \( **5.2**, **5.3**\). A significant proportion of the increase in turnover was due to the success of insect traps developed from CAEP research, with over 200,000 of the traps sold in 2017, most of which were exported to Europe, America, Asia, Africa and Australasia \( **5.3**\). For example, as a result of Keele’s research for a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\), sales of board traps alone increased from £0.5 million to £1 million between 2014 and 2016. The company has been able to increase market share and expand by employing 16 new staff in 2018 \( **5.2**\). 

 The most successful new product, *Optiroll Super Plus*, a sticky trap for thrips, incorporated Keele’s thrips pheromone and was developed further through Keele’s KTP. The Russell IPM team with Keele scientists carried out multiple field trials to identify the most attractive pattern \( **5.1**, **5.4**\). Following this, testing in various crops across the globe, in South America, Africa and the UK, proved the effectiveness of the trap against thrips \( **5.4**\). 

 The *Optiroll Super Plus* trap has been found to offer effective protection against thrips in UK strawberry crops, resulting in 73% less fruit damage and a reduction of thrips on the crop by 53\-87%, when used as part of an integrated pest management programme \( **5.5**\) and was also effective in strawberry crops in Mexico, reducing infestation levels by 50% \( **5.6**\). When using *Optiroll*, strawberry growers’ returns in the UK increased by an estimated £2,000 per hectare, as a result of reduced fruit damage \( **5.5**\). These pheromone traps are being used increasingly by commercial flower growers in Kenya. At an integrated thrips management workshop near Nairobi in 2019, 31% of participants had used thrips pheromones and 65% were considering using them \(66 participants in total\) \( **5.7**\). In 2016, the *Optiroll Super Plus* trap won an Innovation Award at an agricultural expo \(expoDirekt and expoSE\) in Karlsruhe, Germany, which is an international annual event with up to 500 exhibitors and over 6000 visitors \( **5.8**\). In 2018, Russell IPM was awarded the Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation for the *Optiroll Super Plus* trap for western flower thrips, developed with Keele University \( **5.9**\) **.** 

 **Sustainable farming: reducing pesticide use** 

 Growers faced with damaging western flower thrips have had little choice but to turn to chemical pesticides to save the crop, however, populations of western flower thrips throughout the world have become resistant to commonly used pesticides, such as spinosad. The *Optiroll Super Plus* trap and other traps with patterns and improved colours developed by Keele offer an effective alternative to pesticides when used as part of a sustainable integrated pest management programme. For example, in Ecuador a field trial of the *Optiroll Super Plus* trap showed that the capture rate of the trap was high enough to significantly suppress thrips populations when compared to conventional chemical applications \( **5.4**\). The commercial availability of these traps has allowed farmers from across the globe to use less pesticide. In the UK, strawberry farmers using the traps have changed from routine applications of pesticide to just one or two applications in a six\-month season \( **5.5**\); and in Nairobi, Kenya, Evergreen Crops Limited, which grows herbs for export to Europe, now use two initial sprays instead of five, reducing their insecticide use by 15\-20% \( **5.10**\). Strawberry growers in Mexico reported that the traps gave adequate control of western flower thrips without the need for insecticides \( **5.6**\). Collectively, this reduces pesticide residues in fruit and the environment, to the benefit of wildlife and consumers.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the University of Liverpool’s \(UoL\) Social Determinants and Health Inequalities group \(Barr, Taylor\-Robinson, Wickham and Whitehead\) demonstrating the health consequences of alternative public investment strategies has directly influenced policies with major health impacts, including: 

-  Ensuring an NHS resource allocation policy tied to socioeconomic deprivation: equivalent to an additional GBP1,000,000,000 per year going to more disadvantaged areas. 

-  A change in disability benefit assessment; scrapping harmful repeat assessment with the Work Capability Assessment WCA for 24,000 people with deteriorating health problems in England. 

-  A reversal of the government’s proposal to stop monitoring income related child poverty. 

-  Local actions to prioritise investment in children including preventing the closure of 10 children’s centres in Liverpool. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Public investment strategies have an important impact on health inequalities, since changes to the way public funds are allocated have consequences for people’s quality and length of life. 

 Research done by UoL’s Social Determinants and Health Inequalities group has used causal methods, biostatistics, social epidemiology, and evaluation of natural policy experiments to inform public health policy. This has included: 

 1. Showing how policies allocating GBP115,000,000,000 per year of NHS funds to local areas influence health inequalities. \[1\-2\] 

 2. Demonstrating how changes to disability benefits and Universal Credit since 2010 led to increased suicides and mental health problems. \[3\-4\] 

 3. Identifying the adverse child health consequences of increases in poverty and welfare changes since 2010. \[6\-8\] 

##  Equitable NHS investment. 

 Barr and Whitehead’s research was used by the Department for Health and Social Care to model the impact on health inequalities of alternative NHS resource allocation policies, leading to a policy that prioritised investment in more deprived areas. This followed our research that demonstrated that the UK government NHS resource allocation strategy between 1997 and 2010  \- to increase NHS funding to a greater extent in deprived areas of England compared with more affluent areas\- \-,  reduced health inequalities. \[1, 2\] We further demonstrated that policies implemented since 2010 were now reversing this progress and inequalities were widening once again.\[2\] 

##  Welfare reform, disability assessment and mental health. 

 Disability benefit policy in the UK changed following research by Barr, Taylor\-Robinson, Wickham and Whitehead showing the first empirical evidence of the adverse health impacts of Disability benefits assessment in the UK.\[3\] The research demonstrated that the policy of putting over a million people through the new Work Capability Assessment had led to an increase in mental health problems including an estimated additional 600 suicides. Their research also found that this policy did not improve employment chances – the policy’s primary aim. \[3\] 

 Research by Wickham, Taylor\-Robinson, Whitehead and Barr also produced the first empirical evidence of the adverse mental health effects of Universal Credit’s \(UC\) introduction, \[4\] showing that it led to an additional 64,000 people experiencing psychological distress and an additional 21,000 people with clinical depression. 

##  Poverty and investment in child health. 

 Income based measurement of child poverty in the UK was retained following research by Taylor\-Robinson, Barr and Wickham demonstrating the impact that changes in child poverty have on child mental and physical health within a relatively short time frame.\[5\] 

 Barr, Taylor\-Robinson and Whitehead led a programme of knowledge translation: the Inquiry on Health Equity for the North \- Due North \(Chair: Whitehead, evidence papers: Barr, Taylor\-Robinson, set up by Public Health England\). The Inquiry brought together expertise from universities, local government and the voluntary sector across the North of England, highlighting research by Barr, Taylor\-Robinson and Whitehead that indicated the need for local areas to prioritise investment in child health and ensure children’s rights are upheld. \[6\]

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Barr, Whitehead, Wickham and Taylor\-Robinson’s research led to more equitable policies for health including: more equitable allocation of NHS funds to local areas; reduced application of harmful disability benefit assessments, continued monitoring of child poverty and increased local child health investment. 

##  More equitable allocation of NHS funds to local areas. 

 In 2012 the Secretary of State for Health announced proposals to reduce the weighting given to deprivation in the English NHS resources allocation formulae.  Barr and Whitehead presented their research as members of the Department of Health \(DH\) technical advisory group on resource allocation showing how these changes would increase the gap in preventable mortality between disadvantaged and affluent areas. The CEO of the NHS, Sir Simon Stevens, used our research in evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, to justify maintaining the health inequalities adjustment in the NHS allocation formula. \[E1\]  As the Chair of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation stated: “The paper is the best evidence we have seen to date that quantifies the potential impact of the adjustment in the allocations formula for unmet need and health inequalities.”\[E2\] 

 This led to the DH commissioning independent economists from Deloittes to use Barr and Whitehead’s evidence to model the inequalities impact of different funding formulae – leading to  implementation of a formula that prioritised allocation to more deprived areas.\[E2\] This formula allocates an additional GBP1,000,000,000 to the most deprived Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCG\) than would have been the case if the government’s original proposal was implemented.\[E3\] The research has subsequently been used by the World Health Organisation,  to recommend that socioeconomic disadvantage is included in national funding mechanisms that allocate health resource to subnational areas.  This recommendation, made in the European Health Equity Status Report,  was endorsed by member states at the 69th session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe in 2019.\[E4\] 

##  Reduced application of harmful disability benefit assessments. 

 In 2015 our research showing how the Work Capability Assessment \(WCA\) had led to an increase in mental health problems and suicides stimulated an influential debate in parliament and the national media. \[E5\] It was the evidence base for campaigns to change the WCA, informing the Equality and Human Rights Commission \(EHRC\) submission to the UN Convention on the Rights of disabled people \[E6\] and leading the Labour Party to change their policy and commit to abolishing the WCA. \[E7\] The research underpinned the campaign by the opposition and disabled peoples’ organisations that successfully led to the Secretary of State announcing in October 2016 that the government would end reassessments for around 24,000 people per year with the most severe lifetime conditions.\[E7\] Further research in 2020 showing the negative mental health effects of Universal Credit contributed to debates in parliament and in the national media, was presented to the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee.\[E8\] 

##  Poverty and investment in child health. 

 Research by Taylor\-Robinson, Wickham, Barr and Whitehead led to the retention of income\-based measurement of child poverty nationally. In the 2015 Welfare and Work Bill the government proposed removing the requirement in the 2010 Child Poverty Act for governments to monitor income related child poverty. UoL research showing that even short term transitions into poverty had a negative impact on child health was presented to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Health in All Policies \(APPG HiaP\).\[E7\] This evidence was then discussed in the Parliamentary debate on the 2016 Welfare and Work Bill \[E9\]  and used to argue against the government’s proposal. The House of Lords then amended the government’s Bill reversing the government’s proposal, requiring it to continue to monitor income related child poverty.\[E9\] As the chair of the APPG HiaP has stated, “the evidence from Taylor\-Robinson and Barr’s research was crucial in making the case for the House of Lords to the reverse the governments initial proposal ensuring child poverty continues to be monitored.”\[E7\] Within Liverpool our child poverty research led to the development of the joint Children’s Transformation Plan for Liverpool, which enabled the city council to reverse their initial decision to close 10 out of 17 Children’s Centres and resulted in the city signing up to be a UNICEF Child Friendly City. As the former chair of Liverpool CCG states “Without this evidence, it is my view that those vital resources would have been permanently lost for families in the city”.\[E10\] 

##  Summary 

 Over the past two decades the work of the UoL Social Determinants and Health Inequalities group has produced timely and robust evidence monitoring the effects of changes of public policy and investment on health and health inequalities leading to reduced mortality and harm to individuals and communities across the UK and Europe.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Policy\-makers, and land managers try to make decisions based on the best available evidence. One way to answer a question is to collate existing research, and synthesise the findings. Systematic reviews do this in a structured and comprehensive manner, but are often unsuitable for broad topics. 

 We established and developed systematic mapping methodology for environmental and land\-based decision\-making. Rather than answer specific questions, systematic maps investigate the state of research within a topic, can incorporate diverse evidence, and can identify knowledge gaps. 

 Our methodology is now used globally to collate and summarise evidence for environmental and agricultural decision\-makers. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Decisions should be informed by the best available evidence, but often that evidence is difficult for users to find, access or even interpret. An evidence synthesis \(a type of research method\) uses robust and transparent methods to collate research information from a variety of sources and collate and summarise their findings for decision\-makers. Until recently, this method had been little used in land and agricultural management. 

 <ins>Developed</ins> <ins>a searchable database of research</ins> <ins>on farmland biodiversity</ins> 

 Systematic reviews, which usually aim to answer specific questions, are probably the most well\- known evidence synthesis method. In 2012 we were carrying out a systematic review on farmland biodiversity, but found the research too broad and disparate to successfully use the methodology. Instead, we developed a method of collating and summarising the research data into a searchable database to create a ‘map’ of research and gaps<sup>3</sup><sup>.1</sup>. 

 We later illustrated how our method could be used to inform policy for organisations such as Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs \(Defra\), and used our new method to address broad questions set by them for example farmland interventions to mitigate for water quality issues<sup>3.2</sup>. 

 In 2016, we published a methodology paper<sup>3.3</sup> which has now been cited over 200 times, primarily in papers where researchers have used the methodology. The paper appears on the 94<sup>th</sup> percentile on altmetric, which indicates that many other online\-users are sharing this research. 

 <ins>Method</ins><ins>ology</ins> <ins>incorporated into international guidance</ins> 

 Our methodology has been incorporated into international guidance, and has been taken up by other European and global organisations \(see impact section\). The use of systematic mapping alongside existing systematic review methods enables users to not only use existing evidence to answer very specific questions \(as in many traditional systematic reviews\), but also to identify areas for future research priority, for further synthesis or identify research studies that can then be used to inform decisions. We have used systematic mapping methods for organisations from the UK, Europe and globally. These include, Defra, the Scottish government, the Environment Agency, The EU, and Canadian development organisations. 

 <ins>Biodiversity systematic map used</ins> <ins>to address agricultural policy questions</ins> 

 The method has also been incorporated into more extensive research. For example, Dicks et al.<sup>3.4</sup>, describes how our biodiversity systematic map<sup>3.1</sup> was combined with expert opinion, to address agricultural policy questions. This paper has been cited over 100 times.  Stewart et al.<sup>3.5</sup> used systematic mapping methodology as part of a three\-stage review, where a review of reviews was first carried out to identify where existing syntheses were missing, a systematic map was carried out in one of the sub\-areas to identify priority areas for further research, and to identify which specific questions might be feasibly answered through further synthesis, and then a systematic review was used to suggest policy and management implications. 

 <ins>International</ins> <ins>application</ins> <ins>of method</ins><ins>ol</ins><ins>o</ins><ins>gy</ins> 

 Our method is also used internationally. For example, systematic mapping formed part of the evidence gathering part of Ceres 2030, a multidisciplinary partnership led by Cornell University, the International Food Policy Research Institute and the International Institute for Sustainable Development, and funded by Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  The aim is to inform more sustainable food systems globally. This includes identifying priority areas for future funding such as in water scarce regions<sup>3.6</sup>.

 The method has been used and adapted to inform specific management policy by advisory organisations. Specific policy agricultural advice/decisions that systematic mapping has been used to inform include Defra/ Environment Agency advice on cover cropping and buffer strips to reduce water pollution from farmland, Environment Agency advice on managing covers on slurry stores to reduce ammonia emissions, and Scottish Government action to support organic farming. 

 The slurry store study has been used as the basis of changing guidance on slurry management by the Environment Agency, who say that the study “…You may be interested to know that as well adding to our understanding of the anthropogenic aspects of the nitrogen cycle your findings have had a direct impact on our regulatory approach to slurry management...One very specific outcome is that we have withdrawn the use of slurry separation as a recognised ammonia control method.”<sup>5.10</sup>.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Organic\-based heritage objects form an important part of our histories and their preservation is vital. A research team at UCL/Birkbeck has changed conservation best practice by developing tools to evaluate levels of air corrosivity and testing methods to detect early signs of damage. Dosimeters and minimally invasive, sensitive methods are now used in museums throughout the world to protect priceless artifacts. English Heritage is currently reviewing conditions in 1000 showcases and frames as a result. The team’s research has also led to implementation of new conservation treatments in museums and private collections in UK, Europe, and the US, for painting canvases and collagen\-based heritage materials, and in South America \(Brazil\) for earthen architecture. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Priceless and irreplaceable objects of cultural and historical interest need to be protected from degradation and conserved in a sustainable way. Researchers from UCL/Birkbeck have, over the last 20 years \(a\) developed devices to monitor levels of air corrosivity in museums \(b\) analysed the effects of pollutants on heritage objects to inform protocols for assessment of resulting damage to organic\-based heritage materials and \(c\) evaluated effect of novel and sustainable nano\-based materials used for conservation treatment. 

 The UCL/Birkbeck team was the first to demonstrate that volatile organic compounds \(VOCs\) can cause damage not only to inorganic objects but also to organic\-based heritage objects \( **R1**\). Such pollutants became an increasing concern when investigators found that some materials commonly used in the construction of micro\-climate frames and modern showcases allowed build\-up of volatile organic acids at levels which caused damage to objects stored in these locations. 

 To monitor air quality surrounding works of art in museums, palaces, historic houses and display cases, the team used lead\-coated piezo\-electric quartz crystals \(L\-PQC\) to measure levels of corrosivity in indoor air in these locations As part of the EU 7<sup>th</sup> Framework funded MEMORI project \(Measurement, Effect, Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on Movable Cultural Assets Innovative research for market transfer\), the team went on to study the effect of VOCs on a range of materials, including natural and synthetic varnishes on paintings and collagen\-containing materials \(parchment, leather\), and determined threshold levels of volatile organic acids that would cause damage to these materials. \( **R2**\). 

 The dosimeter measures changes in crystal oscillation frequency as the surface coating’s \(lead\) mass changes as it corrodes due to exposure to volatile organic acids. This response has been calibrated in the laboratory and at sites where levels of volatile organic acids have also been assessed using independent measurements from diffusive passive samplers.  Furthermore, as a result of the MEMORI project these measurements can now be used to predict the extent of the damage that would be caused by these materials. 

 The measured signal is then interpreted in terms of a traffic light system which can inform the conservator as to whether the microclimate is acceptable for a class of materials or whether it needs attention. Coupled to appropriate electronics these dosimeters are capable of remote real\-time monitoring and provide a readout for the level of risk posed to objects in that environment **\(R1, R2\).** The range of metal coatings on the dosimeters has now been expanded to detect a wider range of pollutants and these have been evaluated and the electronics improved making the system suitable for a wider range of circumstances \( **R2**\). 

 The team went on to develop a macro to nano\-scaled approach for damage assessment of collagen\-based materials using mechanical testing with programmed RH and Atomic Force Microscopy \(AFM\). AFM images were collected from large numbers of samples both artificially aged \(by inorganic and organic pollutants, temperature, and relative humidity \[RH\]\) and historical parchment/leather samples from diverse European archives. A damage classification scale based on mechanical response to RH and corresponding AFM images was developed **\(R3\).** 

 This damage classification system was then used to evaluate effects of novel nano\-based conservation treatments including calcium carbonate and calcium hydroxide nanoparticle preparations. Alkaline\-based calcium hydroxide nanoparticles were used for paper/canvas deacidification and consolidation. The evaluation assisted in further promoting the tools’ commercialisation. Additional calcium\-containing nanoparticiles were used for pH adjustment of collagen containing materials such as historical damaged parchment and historical vegetable\-tanned leather. The team demonstrated that the treatment had a protective effect particularly on the latter **\(R4\).** 

 The team also applied the mechanical testing protocol with programmed RH cycling to assess the performance of newly developed nanocellulose\-based consolidants for canvas, e.g. nanofibrillated nanocellulose \(CNF\) **\(R5, R6\).** These were tested alongside commonly\-used adhesives \(natural animal glue and synthetic Beva<sup> **®**</sup> 371\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research from UCL/Birkbeck has transformed the way museums, archives and cultural heritage sites conserve their collections by raising awareness of the dangers of volatile organic pollutants and providing simple and economic ways to protect collections. They have also promoted and demonstrated the effectiveness of sustainable materials for conservation treatments. Through wide\-ranging collaborations, workshops and international presentations, the methods and tools devised at UCL/Birkbeck are now embedded in best practice guidelines and applied to collections around the world, from national museums to small private collections. Since 2013, more than 120 conservators at cultural heritage sites and in museums in at least 14 countries have used these new conservation methods, better protecting thousands of priceless objects. 

 **Implementation of L\-PQC to detect volatile organic pollutants in museums across Europe** 

 Traditionally, the presence of VOCs, such as acetic and formic acids have been detected in museums using lead coupons \(shiny lead strips of known mass\) or expensive passive diffusive samplers. The L\-PQC dosimeters developed at UCL/Birkbeck provide conservators with an effective and inexpensive alternative. The metal\-coated piezoelectric quartz crystals \(PQC\) detect and evaluate levels of corrosivity more quickly, more accurately and also remotely. Thousands of artifacts are now being protected following evaluations using L\-PQC in the UK and Europe \( **S1**\). The head conservator at Spain’s SIT Madrid said: ‘ *Since August 2013 until 2020, … L\-PQC \(lead coated piezoelectric quartz\) …were used to test air quality in showcases and microclimate frames in public museums and private art collections in Spain.… As part of our projects for 2020, we are offering the air quality measure service to private art collectors in EU*’ \( **S2**\). 

 Remote monitoring using PQC arrays with additional metal coatings \(Fe,Cu,Ni and Sn\) for detection of corrosivity from inorganic pollutant gases O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, have been used within the Royal Palaces of Abomey in Benin \(UNESCO World Heritage site\) and Apsley House \(English Heritage\) and differences due to geographical location recorded \( **S1**\). 

 **Best practice guidance and decision support model for preservation of organic\-based heritage objects worldwide** 

 The UCL/Birkbeck team’s research and unique database including a combination of model samples subjected to accelerated ageing and a range of historical samples, has directly informed a decision support model published by English heritage \( **S3, S4\)**. 

 Objects and samples from collections from around the world are tested periodically. The decision support model acts as an early warning system \(based on traffic lights code\) where red alerts conservators to the need for intervention. 

 It provides guidelines for optimal display and storage conditions to preserve organic\-based heritage objects. The guidelines are used by more than 120 heritage institutions worldwide to ensure best practice in conservation and preservation. The Senior Conservation Scientist at English Heritage said: “ *Dr Odlyha’s work has been of immense benefit to managing the national collection of over 1 million objects in English Heritage’s care. …The research was critical to the MEMORI decision support model.*“ 

 The decision support model has been shared with over 300 professional and student participants in 14 international workshops and is currently used in major international museums in more than 15 major cities from Paris to Uzbekistan \( **S1**\). English Heritage is using the model to check all its 1000 showcases and painting frames. As part of the programme it has to\-date, refurbished over 90 showcases and 32 painting frames across 19 sites, better preserving more than 3000 precious objects as a direct result of its findings \( **S1**\). 

 **Advancing detection of damage to collagen\-based materials using Atomic Force Microscopy in the UK** 

 Atomic Force Microscopy \(AFM\) for application to collagen\-based materials can detect damage at the collagen fibril level and also reveals presence of localised gelatinised areas. These areas are prone to cracking and can lead to loss of script. Since 2013, a database of AFM images has been established which has facilitated damage assessment on fibres from documents and from leather book\-bindings e.g. Charles Darwin notebooks in English Heritage collections, Down House \( **S1\)**. The protocol was used in the MEMORI project to evaluate effect of exposure of parchment and leather to volatile organic acids and the resulting damage categories included in the decision support model which is currently widely used by English Heritage. The possibility of *in situ* imaging with portable AFM has allowed conservators to assess damage non\-invasively on the object, including an historical 18<sup>th</sup> century parchment manuscript at The National Archives \(London, UK\), a historic violin, and surfaces of paintings at the Tate during treatment \( **S5**\). 

 **Application of novel nano materials for sustainable conservation of cellulose based artifacts worldwide** 

 In paintings conservation, Dr Odlyha introduced the damage assessment protocol involving mechanical analysis to evaluate effects of alkaline\-based nanoparticles applied to cellulose containing materials \(paper and painting canvases\) to negate acidic conditions which develop as these materials age and eventually lose their strength. These results and evaluations of these products has assisted the Centre for Colloid and Surface Science, Florence \(CSGI\) in marketing these preparations. The products have now been sold in 18 countries across Asia, Europe and North and South America in sufficient quantities to protect more than 100,000 cellulose containing objects including painting canvases \( **S6**\). In addition, nanocellulose\-based products which were introduced to consolidate the canvases in the NANORESTART project were tested using this protocol and further developments were made \( **S7\)**. Odlyha has collaborated with Lacerta Technology \(UK\) to test and develop the approach using programmed RH cycles with mechanical testing together with dielectric analysis \( **S8**\). The positive evaluation of these conservation treatments has led to their use by practising paintings conservators across Europe, including via an ERASMUS programme collaboration between UCL/Birkbeck and the School of Conservation in Copenhagen **;** in art conservation studios in Paris \(Aurelia Chevalier, working with the Louvre\); Centre for Colloid and Surface Science \(CSGI\), Florence;  ZFB, Leipzig, Germany; and the Department of Arts and Conservation, University of Barcelona where paintings conservators are trained \( **S9, R8\).** 

 Head conservator at the School of Conservation, Denmark said: “Dr.Odlyha has been a prominent researcher with her work forming part of the group of researchers that laid the basis for an entirely new way of understanding the behaviour and deterioration of canvas paintings in art museums….“ Participants at the sector’s leading conference held at Yale University in 2019 to review conservation research hailed Odlyha’s research as “ *one of the most prominent and wide\-ranging new treatment options announced at the conference”.* \( **S10**\) **.** 

 **Improving conservation of earthen architecture in Brazil** 

 The methods developed at UCL /Birkbeck have also been used to test the effect of using termite mounds in restoration of earthen architecture. Previously, synthetic materials had been used for restoration, but these have different moisture absorption properties to the original materials, affecting stability. The results of tests carried out by UCL/Birkbeck on two large manor houses in Brazil, built using earthen architecture, have led to changes in their practice \( **S11\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Wilson’s research on opera’s hidden history as popular entertainment is changing perceptions of the art form both nationally and internationally, overturning negative stereotypes that serve as a barrier to accessibility. Opera receives a largely negative press today, routinely being characterised as elitist, irrelevant and even un\-British. Wilson’s findings, disseminated to a wide general public via talks, study days, journalism, programme essays, a BBC Radio 3 documentary, and an ac\-trade book, have challenged these norms, enhancing the experience of existing audiences and making the art form more accessible to new ones. Wilson’s work has also been instrumental in bringing about change within the opera industry. Company managers, journalists, and singers have used it to respond to pressing challenges the industry faces today, from the Covid crisis to Brexit, as well as to find new and relevant ways of presenting opera to audiences in the twenty\-first century. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Wilson is internationally recognised as one of the world’s leading authorities in the field of opera reception studies. Her publications over the last two decades \(all sole\-authored\) have enhanced public understanding of the connections between operas and the pressing social, political, and aesthetic debates of their time. More recently her research has begun to focus on the question of why opera is perceived as elitist today, by scrutinising the trope’s roots. She uses historical evidence to show that the chasm between opera and popular culture is not as deep as some like to contend and has revealed a rich history of opera as popular entertainment. This has challenged established modes of thought, calling into question long\-standing and deeply ingrained assumptions about how we categorise different forms of culture. She is generating new ways of thinking that are expanding the audience reach for opera. This work has fallen into three developmental phases: 

 **Phase 1**. A body of publications on the reception of Puccini’s operas during his lifetime. This culminated in *The Puccini Problem: Opera, Nationalism, and Modernity* \(output 4\), which is now the definitive text in its field. This book demonstrated how Puccini reception became bound up with debates about Italianness, race, gender, and aesthetic identity at a vital moment of national self\-definition. Wilson is regularly consulted by arts organisations to write or comment on the relevance of Puccini’s operas to present\-day socio\-cultural challenges. 

 **Phase 2**. A body of publications on opera in 1920s Britain \(outputs 1, 2, 3\). Central to this work is Wilson’s monograph *Opera in the Jazz Age: Cultural Politics in 1920s Britain*, which examines opera’s place in the 1920s ‘battle of the brows’ and provides a vital resource for anyone interested in British identities and taste formation. The book is the first to consider this important debate about cultural categorisation \(which still has ramifications for how we talk about the arts today\) from a musical perspective. Wilson concludes that opera sat closer to the middlebrow than the highbrow, thanks to its mixed audience, close relationship with celebrity, and connections with new technologies and the mass media. 

 **Phase 3**. An emerging body of publications on opera and the elitism stereotype. Wilson first started to explore this issue in output 5, continuing in output 1. Further work is in progress: her next book, supported by a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship, will trace the development of the opera/elitism stereotype from 1920 to 2020.

Daniel Snowman wrote in *Opera* magazine ‘Wilson is one of those rare musicologists capable of seeing opera in its widest historical context…\[An\] impressively researched and highly entertaining book’ \(Source K\). 

 John Snelson, former Head of Interpretation and Publishing at the ROH, argues that Wilson’s work has been ‘prescient in demonstrating that the ideals of the academy can work in partnership with the public in appreciating art’ \(Source A\). Numerous opera companies in the UK and Europe have commissioned Wilson to write essays and give talks that contextualise operas in fresh and accessible ways. The reach of these has been extensive. For example, the ROH alone sold 145,000 programmes containing Wilson’s work \(equating–at GBP8 per programme–to sales for the company worth GBP1,160,000\), many of which will have reached multiple readers. The programmes have been dubbed ‘the best and most interesting of any opera house or company’, ‘essential reading’, and ‘a model of readable scholarship’, thanks to the contributions of esteemed experts such as Wilson \(Source A\). Opera North has used Wilson’s work \(18,300 programmes sold\) to make operas more relevant to modern audiences: her essays have ‘encouraged fresh ways of thinking’ about familiar operas and cut through ‘traditional assumptions’ and ‘popular prejudices’ \(Source B\). 

 The music industry and academia often exhibit distaste for ‘crowd\-pleasing’ operas, a factor that new and potential audience members find off\-putting. Wilson’s work has dispelled longstanding snobbery surrounding Puccini’s works. For the ROH, Wilson’s authoritative essays have enriched audiences’ understanding of the significance of these often\-maligned operas, their cultural contexts and their ongoing influence. Snelson calls Wilson ‘a rare leading voice in tackling the fault line of popularity and perceived cultural value’ and says her work has challenged long\-standing received wisdom about high and low culture that has ‘disproportionately dictated aesthetic values for much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in opera’ \(Source A\). It has, in effect, given audiences a licence to enjoy these works ‘guilt\-free’. 

 Although a current backlash against canonical operas by ‘dead white men’ is making life harder for opera companies, who must programme operas by popular composers such as Puccini in order to survive financially, Wilson has shown them to be works of ‘urgent contemporary relevance’ \(Source B\), by drawing parallels with present\-day debates about nationalism, corruption, race, and sexual violence. Wilson’s work has deepened and enriched audiences’ appreciation of specific works and of operatic culture in general: as audience member Chris Brown notes, it ‘changes our understanding of both past and present’ and ‘challenges us to change our understanding of the genre and not to give up the attempt to widen its appeal’ \(Source C\). 

 The ubiquitous opera/elitism trope not only deters new audiences from exploring opera but also hampers the efforts of everyone involved in performing and promoting the art form. Wilson uses historical evidence to challenge damaging stereotypes, demonstrating that in the fairly recent past people of all social backgrounds used to enjoy opera as part of a broad entertainment culture. Michael Volpe, Founder and former General Director of Opera Holland Park, now Executive Director at Iford Arts, says that Wilson has overturned established modes of thought about opera and its audience: ‘The idea that the average Joe can enjoy opera in a day\-to\-day way–that opera can be a populist art form–is often dismissed as a fantasy. But Alexandra’s book and radio programme show that it isn’t’. He adds, ‘In future when I’m asked “can opera be a more popular art form?” I shall direct the enquirer to her work’ \(Source D\). 

 Audience member Kerry Bunkhall \(Source E\) was told in her formative years by her community, including teachers, that opera was elitist. Wilson’s Radio 3 documentary and NotesOnNotes podcast enabled her to dismiss negative stereotypes that were hampering her own enjoyment and provided a user\-friendly tool with which to share her passion with others. Both Bunkhall and Brown \(Source C\) see Wilson’s work on 1920s operatic culture and the middlebrow as providing a model for how opera might be presented in less ‘luxurious’ ways in the future. A talk Wilson gave for the educational charity ‘Opera Prelude’ at the Cadogan Hall \(25/09/18\) not only enhanced attendees’ understanding of Puccini’s operas but led to their perceiving the composer as ‘more human’ \(Source F\). This event also provided a young singer with a fairly paid performance opportunity. 

 Wilson’s research has also helped opera singers to navigate a now often\-hostile cultural environment in the UK. Adriana Festeu \(Senior Lecturer at Leeds College of Music and Programme Tutor, Royal Academy of Music\), notes that Wilson’s work in changing ‘the way in which opera is perceived as an art form’ is ‘crucial in the development of the next generation of performers’. It has inspired young singers from deprived backgrounds to work actively towards bringing operatic experiences to their hometowns and fight the elitism stereotype that is still propagated in the media. Wilson’s work also encourages them to explore new repertories and has shown them how to ‘“sell” their art form’ to audiences in a fresh, informed way. Festeu writes that Wilson’s work on historical singers has even changed her own identity as a singer: ‘Being aware of opera’s historical legacy makes me feel that what I do is meaningful and part of a tradition’ \(all Source F\). 

 The elitism stereotype is largely a media construct, but Wilson’s work is changing the way journalists write about opera. Her ‘lively Twitter account’ has become a point of reference for music critics \(Sources G, H, I\). Alexandra Coghlan, who writes for *The Telegraph*, *The Independent*, *New Statesman*, *The Spectator*, *Gramophone* and *Opera*, says: ‘Wilson’s contributions on social media have definitely changed how I have approached opera as a music journalist. Her particular research focus on high/low culture and our changing attitude toward opera in the UK has shaped how I approach questions of elitism or snobbery surrounding opera. I hadn't previously realised how modern a phenomenon such divisions were, and thanks to her work on the 1920s and opera's social context then, I have a much more lively sense of comparison and context for today's environment’ \(Source H\). Critic Richard Bratby states that opera’s non\-elite history ‘is not yet widely grasped by colleagues in my field; and your work has helped bring it into the centre of the discussion’ \(Source I\). Wilson’s research has ‘successfully shifted perceptions on taste and popularity in the wider classical music world’, and broadened the range of repertories about which editors are willing to commission articles and books \(Source I\). Wilson’s work on opera’s connections with film and celebrity have altered the way in which industry figures \(Sources B and H\) and audience members \(Source C\) view opera’s cultural status. 

 The OBERTO events, which attract critics, singers, opera managers, directors and dramaturgs from around the world, as well as members of the public, have become an essential forum for addressing ‘topical issues that are highly pertinent to the operatic profession’ \(Source F\). So significant was the 2014 conference on elitism deemed to be that it was discussed in a book aimed at opera professionals, *The Business of Opera* \(ed. Belina\-Johnson and Scott, Ashgate, 2015\). The OBERTO events also influence programming: Opera Holland Park has called them ‘really useful in introducing opera professionals to unusual repertory’ \(Source D\). Furthermore, the events have not only fostered networks between industry figures but put them directly in contact with their audience, which has helped to counter pockets of snobbery within the opera industry itself. The former Head of Interpretation at the ROH states that the ‘OBERTO interactions have challenged directors and critics working within the echo chamber of the opera business to question their relationship to the wider audience upon whom they rely’ \(Source A\). Wilson’s historical work has shown companies how to market their product more effectively, by showing ‘where the art form’s enduring appeal lies and how that appeal can be rediscovered and reasserted’ \(A\). 

 John Allison, editor of *Opera* magazine, argues that the 2017 event on musical migration helped the industry to address one of the biggest challenges of the present moment, Brexit, whose impact on opera he calls ‘significant and potentially catastrophic’ \(Source G\). Because many opera professionals and journalists attended, papers presented at this event ‘have been widely cited in ongoing conversations within the operatic community’ \(G\). The study day was deemed so important that it was discussed in an *Opera* editorial and the magazine commissioned Wilson to write an extended article on the topic. The parallels Wilson has revealed between debates about cultural protectionism in the 1920s and those taking place today have helped artists, administrators and critics to navigate the challenges they face as Britain leaves the EU \(G\). Stuart Leeks of Opera North also notes the value Wilson’s public engagement work on opera and nationalism brings to bear on contemporary debates about Brexit \(Source B\), while Festeu, originally from Romania, says Wilson’s research has helped her as a singer to broach a cultural divide between different national traditions \(Source F\). 

 Both the ROH and Opera Holland Park \(Sources A and D\) note that Wilson’s work has revealed that opera companies of the 1920s were dealing with challenges concerning audience engagement and a British antipathy towards opera that still seem very familiar today. The innovative solutions that were found in the 1920s are particularly valuable in 2021 and beyond, when the opera industry finds itself at a moment of unprecedented upheaval. In 2020 Covid\-19 halted operatic activity and sent the global opera industry into a phase of deep self\-reflection. Volpe \(Source D\) argues that the economic challenges resulting from the pandemic have made it clear that the current British model of presenting opera, which revolves around an expensive ‘star system’, is no longer viable and needs to be replaced by a sustainable model of ‘popular opera’. He says that Wilson’s work on opera in 1920s Britain has suddenly come into its own, because it demonstrates that ‘a lean, economical, self\-supporting sort of opera…thrived in this country in the past and could do so again’. He proposes that Wilson’s work ‘provides a blueprint that today’s opera companies can use as they move forward into the post\-Covid era’ and urges anyone currently involved in the programming or promotion of opera to read Wilson’s work. At times of crisis, the operatic landscape in the UK always transforms itself in order to survive: Wilson’s findings have given the industry a toolkit with which to do so again. They form, Volpe argues, ‘a crucial reference point for the entire business of British opera’. 

 In sum, Wilson’s research has made multifaceted impacts upon opera goers and the opera industry, enriching audience experiences, breaking down barriers to accessibility, changing received thought, and giving opera professionals the tools with which to address a variety of challenges that the industry faces at a particularly difficult moment in its history. Its impact is ‘felt beyond its immediate focus’ \(Source C\) and as John Allison of *Opera* writes, on behalf of the opera industry as a whole: ‘\[Wilson’s\] work matters very much to us all’ \(Source G\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton’s School of Mathematical Sciences into dynamic scheduling in the airport environment has been used to optimise operations in London Heathrow Airport’s baggage handling system, as part of the airport’s GBP16bn expansion programme. With its 80 million annual passengers \(pre\-COVID\-19\), inherent uncertainty in aircraft arrival and departure times, and costly, multi\-stakeholder implications of baggage delay, Heathrow’s baggage system posed a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. 

 Novel data\-driven optimisation tools, developed by Professor Chris Potts through collaborations with Heathrow and leading consultancy firm Arup, resulted in a new approach for scheduling the delivery of luggage to baggage carousels \(reclaims\) and a 20% reduction in the rate of short\-landed bags \(bags not transported with the passenger to the destination airport\).These significant improvements **increased convenience for passengers** and achieved **cumulative cost savings of GBP55m for the aviation industry**. This comprised **annual savings to the airline industry of GBP10m since October 2016** relating to short\-landed baggage costs and a **reduction in capital expenditure of over GBP20m for Heathrow Airport Limited** by improved scheduling and thereby eliminating the need to invest in additional baggage carousels. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Discrete optimisation has been a significant research area of the Operational Research \(OR\) group at the University of Southampton since the 1980s, with **scheduling** featuring prominently. An important sector where discrete optimisation is very useful is for planning airport operations.  Specifically, airports require scheduling and other discrete optimisation problems to be solved in order to create cost\-effective plans for baggage operations that provide passengers with an appropriate level of service. The OR group were therefore well placed to work with Arup and Heathrow Airport Limited on the optimisation of baggage operations. 

 Early research on scheduling mainly considered classical production scheduling problems having a single objective, with all problem data assumed to be deterministic and known in advance. However, **Professor Chris Potts** \(School of Mathematical Sciences\) introduced models, first published in 2001, that better capture some of the features that are present in practical scheduling applications. In one particular generalisation of classical scheduling, he extended the model beyond the production facility to include a larger part of the supply chain. For example, in \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] he proposed models and algorithms that combine decisions about production scheduling and the delivery of products to customers. In \[ **3.3**\] he explored methods for addressing the trade\-off between minimising waste when cutting materials to satisfy customer orders and reducing delays in the timely delivery of these orders to the customers. 

 More complex models require more sophisticated solution techniques. A widely\-used approach for tackling these challenging problems is to use metaheuristics, often known as local search methods. These techniques typically provide near\-optimal solutions while imposing limits on the computation time used. The key to the success of such methods is to navigate the solution space efficiently in the search for a high\-quality solution. 

 Creating enhancements to models often transforms a single\-objective problem into a problem with multiple objectives that are typically conflicting. Potts, in \[ **3.3**\], adapted a single\-objective metaheuristic solution approach to one that find solutions to problems with multiple objectives.  This was achieved by setting primary and secondary objectives and periodically alternating between them throughout the search procedure performed by the metaheuristic. 

 The GBP5.3m EPSRC\-funded LANCS Initiative \( **G1**, 2008\-14\) had a research aim of building theory for application to practical OR problems. LANCS had Transportation and Logistics as a research cluster, with Potts having the role of co\-leader. As a consequence of the collaborative opportunities offered through LANCS, the principles underpinning Potts’ production scheduling studies \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] evolved into methodologies to improve the efficiency of transport and logistics systems. The problems addressed often have multiple objectives due to the different stakeholders. For example, maximising the convenience of passengers in a transport system often conflicts with minimising the operating costs of the transport provider. Furthermore, many problems are dynamic or on\-line, implying that information about the future arrives over time so that decisions have to be made with incomplete knowledge. 

 In a project funded by EUROCONTROL, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation \( **G2**, 2008\-11\), Potts led the design of various algorithms for more efficient scheduling of aircraft landings, without compromising safety. A key element of this problem is to increase runway utilisation by avoiding heavier aircraft landing immediately before lighter aircraft because safety constraints impose a longer separation time between landings in such cases due to the turbulence caused by wake vortices. This is an on\-line problem because the appearance of aircraft onto an air traffic controller’s radar screen is typically about 30 minutes before the landing time and landing times need to be fixed for aircraft arriving in the next 5\-10 minutes. Potts designed a rolling horizon algorithm \[ **3.4**\] in which the landing schedules are updated periodically to account for any new information about arriving aircraft. Multiple objectives included minimising: \(a\) the average and last landing time; \(b\) penalties for deviation from preferred landing times; and \(c\) extra fuel used for any delayed landing. This on\-line problem with multiple objectives has similar characteristics to those arising in the planning of baggage operations for arriving aircraft; the passenger experience in the baggage hall in terms of crowding, and waiting time needs balancing against the efficient deployment of baggage handlers. 

 This body of research in large\-scale combinatorial optimisation underpinned a partnership with Heathrow Airport Limited, beginning in 2012, to maximise the efficiency of the airport’s baggage processing operations. Much of the methodology was already in place to address the challenges. In particular, Potts’ research expertise in scheduling was used to design algorithms for determining the timing and routing of baggage to the airport arrivals hall, making use of available techniques in optimisation with multiple objectives \[ **3.3**\] and also in algorithms for on\-line problems \[ **3.4**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 London Heathrow Airport served over 80 million passengers annually at its pre\-COVID\-19 peak \[ **5.1**\] and handled an estimated 110 million pieces of baggage \[ **5.2**\]. Baggage operations are vital for the smooth running of an airport and the resource allocation and scheduling methods required to determine their efficient operation are not available in standard business process software. The operations represent a significant cost to airport operators and airlines. Airport charges that cover the cost of these processes have become a more significant part of the overall ticket price in recent years and consequently efficiency improvements are important for all of the three key stakeholder groups: passengers, airlines and airport operators. 

 The three key stakeholder groups for the airport each have their own objectives for the baggage system. While the airport operator is focused on cost, passengers and airlines tend to be more concerned about the level of service that they receive, e.g. the time spent waiting for bags to arrive or the level of overcrowding in the airport arrivals hall. This makes the optimisation problems multi\-objective. An airport also operates with a significant amount of uncertainty stemming from the stochastic nature of aircraft arrival and departure times. 

 Based on his research expertise in combinatorial optimisation, including work on runway scheduling, Potts began working with Heathrow Airport Limited on optimising its baggage operations in 2012 with the key outcomes of the collaboration occurring during the REF 2021 impact period \[ **5.3**\]. The baggage handling system at an airport the size of Heathrow is complex and requires careful planning to be robust against uncertainties in flight arrival and departure times. Potts’ work contributes in two ways. First, it ensures that advance planning is in place. Second, it allows the daily planning of operations to be adapted to flight delays and uncertainty about the arrival order of aircraft, which is dictated on the day by air traffic control. Accounting for uncertainty requires a data\-driven approach in which operational plans are updated in real time using online optimisation algorithms that can find effective new solutions quickly. A specific example of this is the allocation of arriving flights to baggage carousels. Potts designed an algorithm for allocating baggage reclaims which incorporates multiple objectives, thereby helping to ensure that passenger waiting times for baggage are kept as low as possible, passenger crowding in the baggage hall is not excessive, and baggage handlers’ time is used effectively. 

 According to the Director of Operational Planning at Heathrow Airport, “ *The work stopped us from changing the operational approach to a fixed allocation plan \(which was preferred by some of the handling teams\) as it demonstrated this would have led to a deterioration in performance, and a worsening of passenger experience at Heathrow. The project showed us that allocation needed to be kept dynamic or we would need additional capacity to avoid congestion*” \[ **5.3**\] **.** He continued: “ *… the work carried out with the University of Southampton has allowed us to take a more scientific approach to managing the complex baggage handling system at Heathrow that is able to react quickly to disruptions in flight arrivals. This has been invaluable in improving our operational efficiency*.” The benefits in terms of increased operational efficiency in an airport the size of Heathrow are substantial. The Director of Operational Planning concluded: “ *As an indication of the value of this, increasing capacity efficiency to the extent of avoiding the requirement to add one additional reclaim has been estimated **to save over £20mill in Capex* \[GBP20,000,000 in capital expenditure\].” 

 In 2016, Arup was part of a consortium awarded a GBP16bn contract to manage the expansion of Heathrow where a key component of the expansion plans involved a transformation of the baggage handling systems. Arup is an independent firm of designers, planners, engineers, architects, consultants and technical specialists, with annual revenues of GBP1.7bn. Due to his earlier work with Heathrow Airport Limited, Potts was approached by Arup to assist with some aspects of the transformation project, drawing on his expertise in multi\-objective combinatorial optimisation \[ **3.3**\] and on\-line scheduling \[ **3.4**\].  Specifically, he developed a data\-driven performance tool that produced a better characterisation of the reasons for baggage being short\-landed \(bags not transported with the passenger to the destination airport\). Not unexpectedly, results showed that delays to aircraft landings have adverse effects on baggage movement and thereby incur subsequent costs \[ **5.4**\]. They also suggested a set of key performance indicators that distil the multiple data sources into just a handful of statistics that provide the best way of monitoring the behaviour of the baggage handling system \[ **5.4**\]. Summing up the significance of the challenge that the development tool was designed to address, Arup’s Airport Development Team Leader wrote: “ *The cost of failure can be high. Within the industry, the overall costs incurred as a result of a bag not being delivered for the passenger to collect are estimated to be around £100 per bag … At Heathrow alone, we estimate that the cost arising from short\-landed bags, before the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008, used to be around £60 million annually* \[ **5.4**\].” 

 The resulting tool, based on the University of Southampton research, has significantly reduced the number of short\-landed bags, which has translated into substantial cost savings for the airline industry. Arup confirms: “ *Heathrow’s short\-landed rate has, since this particular piece of work was completed in October 2016, improved by around 20% \- **saving airlines an estimated £10 million annually**,*” \[ **5.4**\] amounting to a **cumulative saving of approximately GBP35,000,000** up to the start of the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 Describing its collaboration with Southampton as “ *extremely fruitful”*, Arup stated that the research results were of direct relevance to their own business and that of their clients \[ **5.4**\]. Its Airport Development Team Leader said: “ *It has proved the concept and value of integrating large, disparate data sets to produce information upon which action can be taken. At Arup we are actively pursuing ways in which this approach to baggage data can be productionised and used as a commercial service offering to other airports* \[ **5.4**\].” This is further evidenced by Arup’s use of their baggage handling project with Heathrow as a case study for its business development aims \[ **5.5**\]; Arup is using the knowledge transfer from Southampton as a significant component of their consultancy offering for other airports in order to access a market that, it says, could represent several millions of pounds per year \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Potts’ work also feeds into Heathrow’s growth plans for developing Terminal 5, which are currently on hold owing to the COVID\-19 pandemic. Heathrow’s Director of Operational Planning said: “ *We were also in the process of implementing the full findings of this work on a wider scale by including it in growth plans for Terminal 5, the largest terminal, when the pandemic began … and we are already looking at similar approaches to tackle the new issues created by the impacts of COVID\-19 and hygiene measures such as social distancing.*” \[ **5.4**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Rodney Harrison has directed a series of connected research projects about heritage futures while based at the UCL Institute of Archaeology. Working closely with international partner organisations, he has brought together professionals from a range of sectors who are engaged with heritage preservation, influencing professional heritage practitioners to adopt more sustainable and resilient conservation practices. The projects have also inspired, co\-created and supported new forms of artistic expression and have changed how general publics think about heritage and its role in building futures through a long\-term exhibition and collaboration with Manchester Museum. Harrison’s research has shaped the AHRC’s Future Heritage Research Strategy and associated research funding priorities.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Futures studies – defined as systematic investigations of historical and contemporary social, ecological and political phenomena to postulate possible or probable future scenarios – is a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field of research, united by the general aim to empower researchers and publics with foresight to help them to more actively and accurately shape desired futures. Since joining UCL in 2012, Harrison has directed a series of research projects that have: introduced comparative perspectives to the study of natural and cultural heritage practices; reframed and redefined the concept of heritage as more dynamic and future\-oriented; and broadened the definition of heritage to include waste and other anthropogenic legacies \(such as climate\).The framework for this work was established in *Heritage: Critical Approaches* **\[R1\]** which argues for a more joined up approach to natural and cultural heritage conservation and management. It shows how this might be realised by way of hybrid forums composed of experts from a range of disciplines and local community representatives \(see also **\[R2\]**\). The ways different kinds of heritage practices contribute to the building of different social worlds is conceptualised and demonstrated in the co\-authored monograph *Collecting, Ordering, Governing* **\[R3\]**. 

 From 2015\-2019 Harrison was the PI on the AHRC\-funded Heritage Futures \(HF\) research programme \[i\] and from 2017\-2020 on the AHRC\-funded Heritage Priority Area Leadership Fellowship \(PALF\) project \[ii/iii\]. HF is the largest critical, comparative study of heritage and heritage\-like practices across traditional sectoral boundaries. HF found that despite future rhetoric in heritage practice – typically said to be undertaken for the benefit of ‘future generations’ – few natural or cultural heritage practitioners, organisations or policy makers think in concrete terms about when the futures they are working for will take place, who will be in them, or how their work in the present actively contributes to realising the futures for which they claim to be working **\[R4\]**. Structured around the themes of uncertainty, transformation, diversity and profusion, HF research identified a range of key issues that are common across natural and cultural heritage which could form the basis for more integrated and coordinated collaboration across the sector **\[R4/R5\]** and which might also influence both policy\-making **\[R4\]** and research in these areas **\[R4/R5/R6\]**. HF research elaborated on previous research **\[R3\]** to identify how modes of *collecting* in the field influence modes of *ordering* in ex\-situ collections, which in turn realise particular kinds of *management* of the endangered objects, places, species or practices these collections act as proxies for, and thus both *what* is preserved and *how* **\[R4\]**. Working collaboratively across natural and cultural collections has allowed Harrison and his team to identify shared problems and how these might be addressed collectively **\[R4/R5\]**. A focus on topics such as nuclear waste and climate change has shown how natural and cultural heritage conservation practices must accept, and can work creatively with, inevitable and rapidly accelerating forms of environmental, climatological and social change, rather than against it **\[R4/R5/R6\]**. HF research highlights the value and importance of comparative approaches to natural and cultural heritage practices and the need to see heritage as only one \(valorised\) form of human inheritance, which also includes waste and climate change in the Anthropocene **\[R6\]**. Research also showed, for example, how ideas from the realm of household decluttering might be applied in innovative ways to address some of the apparent problems of ‘profusion’ in contemporary collections **\[R4/R5\]**. Harrison is Co\-I for a follow\-on funding project that, in collaboration with the National Trust and Historic England, considers how natural and cultural heritage managers can work with inevitable processes of environmental and climatological change \[iv\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Current global crises and transformations \(from climate change to mass migration to new social movements\) highlight the need to develop more sustainable and resilient conservation practices which are sensitive to inevitable processes of future social, environmental and political change and to encourage practitioners from different areas of interest to identify and pursue common goals and learn from one another. However, there has been a trend towards increasing specialisation within the heritage sector \(e.g. see IUCN/ICOMOS 2015\). These global issues also highlight the need for better understanding amongst general publics of the role of natural and cultural heritage in resourcing the future, and the specific ways in which they do so. The activities of Harrison and his Heritage Futures \(HF\) and Priority Area Leadership Fellowship \(PALF\) teams have had an impact on natural and cultural heritage policy making and conservation and management practice, changing the ways in which heritage is understood by its users and publics, by bringing these fields into closer dialogue with the field of futures studies. 

 **Deeping understanding and changing practice in international heritage organisations** 

 Harrison and his HF team worked closely with an international advisory board and 25 international partner organisations, bringing together professionals from a wide range of sectors who are engaged with heritage preservation to think collectively about shared issues. The HF team facilitated a series of inter\- and intra\-thematic knowledge exchange events involving and co\-designed by these partner organisations and other invited participants. These included: a 2016 workshop exploring issues of long term futures in heritage management at the site of the long term nuclear waste repository being constructed by partner organisation SKB \(Swedish Nuclear Waste Management company\); a 2017 workshop at Kew Gardens looking at different forms of collecting and categorization practices and their influence on the definition and management of different forms of heritage; and a 2018 workshop at Orford Ness, co\-organised with the National Trust \(NT\) and Historic England \(HE\), exploring issues relating to natural and cultural heritage management in changing coastal environments **\[R4/R5\]**, \[i\]. Each was attended by representatives of the partner organisations and other relevant practitioners \(c.30\-35 people for each workshop\). Harrison and his team have also organised workshops on data and heritage in conjunction with the Alan Turing Institute and British Library \(2017\), and with UK\-based museums and archives on contemporary collecting practices \(2018\). These workshops constituted important professional development opportunities for participants, which deepened understanding and changed organisational practice. 

 The Director of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Nature Culture Initiative described the Kew workshop as a “valuable opportunity” that “created the foundation for deeper understanding of perspectives, and mutual learning” with conservation professionals **\[A1\]**. The Curator of Kew’s Economic Botany collection, attested to the change of perspectives inaugurated by their involvement: “hosting the workshop was important in changing internal perceptions of Kew \(previously described by senior staff as ‘not a museum’\) and positioning it firmly in the museum sector”, developing “a greater awareness of the big questions and wider context of the future of our collections, looking well beyond our usual 5\-year horizon”, and “building expertise and confidence in humanities engagement \[at Kew\], through new contacts, through giving time for thinking and discussing, and in enabling Kew staff to adapt to boundary\-stretching work” **\[A2\]**. The NT’s Historic Environment Director, noted that the project was the “longest and best \[…\] period of CPD for me” and has led to further engagement by NT regarding “the need to adapt to and mitigate accelerated environmental change” through **\[A1\]** the ‘Landscape Futures’ follow\-on project \[iv\] on which she is a Co\-I. The involvement of advisory board members at Director and Assistant Director level at the NT, UNESCO, IUCN and ICOMOS has ensured HF’s significant impacts within international heritage practice. The Director of IUCN observes that HF has provided international heritage organisations, such as IUCN, with “validation of the need to rethink fundamentals and not just re\-present existing approaches” and demonstrated the value of “reframing nature\-culture considerations in conservation practice” through engaging with “a project that thinks on timescales beyond the normal short\-termism of conservation decision taking” **\[A1\]**. 

 **Changing the ways in which heritage is understood by its users and publics** 

 An exhibition on Heritage Futures was developed around the four main themes of the project in collaboration with the Manchester Museum \(MM\) to communicate the more expansive view of heritage and its role in resourcing futures developed by Harrison and the HF team **\[R1/R4/R5\]**,\[i\]. The museum decided to extend its originally planned 3\-month run to at least 2 years \(December 2018\-end 2020\) and to make the exhibition central to their major planned redevelopment \(called “Manchester: Hello Future”\) in recognition of its significance, not only to the museum’s visitors, but to the museum’s expanded understanding of its own role **\[B2\]**. This run was cut short by COVID when the museum closed in March 2020; however, at the time of writing a virtual version of the exhibition is in development. HF’s research programme themes formed the basis for a number of additional activities developed by the museum to engage with their own partner organisations and community. For example, ‘Heritage Futures Studio’ provided grants of up to GBP1,000 to support the development and delivery of creative projects and events by local groups **\[B2\]**. Under this initiative 6 projects were funded, creating 10 events and exhibitions which reached audiences of over 100,000 people **\[B2\]**. Importantly, many of these audiences were external to the museum. In its first year the exhibition itself was visited by over 360,000 people; based on the first year’s figures the total number of visitors over its 15\-month run is estimated to have been c.420,000 people **\[B2/3\]**. A survey conducted at the beginning of 2020 showed that the exhibition had an impact on visitors’ intended personal recycling behaviours and their understanding of the importance of collective action in conserving the natural and cultural environment and preventing further climate change. In addition, the exhibition changed visitors’ understanding of heritage as a concept. Prior to visiting the exhibition, 85.7% of those surveyed said that heritage was more associated with the past; having visited the exhibition 90% agreed that heritage was more associated with shaping the future. It also generated an enhanced and expanded understanding of what heritage encompasses, with several of the visitors noting their surprise at the inclusion of language and contemporary objects/buildings in the context of heritage **\[B4\]**. 

 The Director of MM noted that HF “themes encouraged the museum and its audiences to look at its collection differently \(across subject specialist boundaries\) and critically \(in the context of wider questions around heritage\). In particular, the theme of profusion has fed into our thinking for the development of the Museum’s Zero Waste Hub, an experimental space for ecological thinking and action” **\[B2\]**. The exhibition also influenced the choice of title by Director of the Museum for her linked ‘Professorship of Heritage Futures’ at University of Manchester. A curator on the exhibition, noted that “the four themes – profusion, diversity, transformation and uncertainty – were a powerful model for considering the work of the museum and the difference it was trying to make”. In this way, “Heritage Futures enabled the Museum to make more of its various exhibits, and to more clearly communicate its ambitions around a more future\-focussed role and purpose.” The curator has subsequently left the museum to start a new consultancy connecting museums with the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change issues. He notes the significance of the project in this decision, indicating how “Heritage Futures made me reflect on my own future and what I am aiming to achieve through my own work, working with others” **\[B1\]**. Drawing on **\[R6\]**, these themes are carried through in a subsequent collaboration between the curator, Harrison’s PALF team and the Glasgow Science Centre \(GSC\) on a high\-profile international design competition, *Reimagining Museums for Climate Action*, which supports the development of an exhibition on museums, heritage and climate change that is being co\-developed for the Glasgow Science Centre for COP26 in November 2021 \[ii/iii\]. The competition received 543 registrations and 264 final entries from architects, artists, designers, museum professionals, indigenous representatives, poets, and activists across 48 countries \(185 from Global North, 75 from Global South or mixed \(4 not stated territory\)\). 

 **Inspiring, co\-creating and supporting new forms of artistic expression** 

 Through HF, Harrison and his team also worked closely with artists to commission artistic products related to each of its four themes \(uncertainty \[Martin Kunze, Karen Guthrie\], transformation \[Antony Lyons\], diversity \[Nancy Campbell\] and profusion \[Shelley Castle\]; **\[R4\]** \[i\]\). Testimonials from the artists show how their involvement in the project has had a significant impact on their practice and future projects. Lyons described working with HF as a valuable learning experience and his contribution to the project’s book provided “the opportunity to reflect on, and consolidate, some core strands of my artist practice and critically deepen some particular elements” **\[C1\]**. Lyons’ involvement led to two year\-long artist residencies hosted by project partners \(Wheal Martyn Museum and Orford Ness, NT\) and his subsequent appointment as 2020 artist\-in\-residence at the Elan Valley in Wales. Through the HF residencies he has produced site\-specific artworks that have reached a total audience of 12,000 people \(with a further 25,000 having engaged with his work online\) and led engagement workshops for 190 participants **\[C1\]**. Castle, Creative Associate at Encounters Art, worked with HF to co\-create a project focusing on the values people invest in objects in their home environment. In May 2018 this culminated in creative community installation ‘ [Human Bower](http://heritage-futures.org/the-human-bower)’. Castle reflects that “the most striking aspect of the impact \[…\] is how it has stimulated a conscious awakening in myself as an artist and deep reflection on my own practice” **\[C2\]**. The inclusion of these artworks in the exhibition at the MM has ensured their exposure to significant audiences which these artists would not have otherwise been able to reach \(360,000 in first year, estimated 420,000 until COVID closure on 18<sup>th</sup> March 2020\) **\[B2/3\]**. For Kunze, founder of Memory of Mankind \(MOM\), a global time capsule project which aims to stores data on stable ceramic disks for a million years into the future, HF activities provided unique space for collaboration. Kunze remarks that he “had not previously found the time nor the right people with whom to discuss \[his project\]” and that participation in “the HF network has increased the profile of MOM \[…\] with diverse experts, the media, and other engaged individuals” **\[C3\]**. 

 **Shaping heritage research policy in the UK and internationally to further influence heritage management policy and practice** 

 Harrison’s work on HF and PALF has shaped how heritage is defined and researched through the take up of his findings by the AHRC. Harrison redrafted the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council’s Future Heritage Research Strategy with AHRC staff, defining 8 key priority research areas to guide decision making on strategic research funding **\[D1\]**. Drawing directly on his research, these included topics such as: ‘values and cultural heritage’ **\[R1\]**; ‘inclusion and diverse heritages’ **\[R1/R3\]**; sustainable management of heritage’ **\[R4/R5\]**; and ‘future heritages’ **\[R4/R5/R6\]**, which asked ‘How can we identify, and conserve, the emergent heritages that will be of value to future generations?’. The strategy also places a strong emphasis on the relations between natural and cultural heritage **\[R2\]**. 

 PALF has been cited as an example of ‘Innovation in Cultural Heritage Research’ in a report prepared for BEIS by the UK National Commission for UNESCO on the innovative capacity of the cultural heritage sector within the UK and how it can aid international development **\[D2\]**. HF has been used as a case study of research impact contributing to sustainable development in a joint report produced by the AHRC and Swedish National Research Council for the Joint Programming Initiative in Cultural Heritage and Global Change **\[D3\]**. AHRC’s Associate Director of Programmes notes Harrison’s PALF activities have “strengthen\[ed\] the narrative and evidence base for the economic, social and cultural value and impact of heritage research, as well as enhance\[d\] the research capability for heritage research as a cross\-disciplinary and collaborative field of enquiry” **\[D4\]**. By informing heritage research priorities for the main UK funder of heritage and museums related research \(AHRC fund over 75% of all academic research on heritage undertaken in the UK\), Harrison’s work has led to significant changes in the kinds of research being funded and undertaken in the UK. His research has shaped particular thematic research funding calls, including the JPICH ‘Changing Environments’ and ‘Conservation, Protection and Use’ calls, and the AHRC GCRF Urgency Grants Highlight for ‘Proposals Addressing Threats to Cultural Heritage resulting from Natural Disasters and Climate Change’ **\[D4\]**. In turn, research projects funded under those calls have increased understanding, and changed ways of managing natural and cultural heritage, in the UK and internationally **\[D4\]**.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Over the past 8 years, the Human Performance Science research group’s work has had a demonstrable impact on enhancing professional judgement and decision making \(PJDM\) expertise in hyperdynamic environments, both inside and outside sport. These environments are characterised by time\-pressured decision making, uncertainty, ill\-defined and competing goals, high stakes, and stressful field conditions. Research in sport and performance psychology has established new evidence, which has been applied and had impact to: 

-  advance sports coaching policy and practice to develop more than 3,000 practitioners’ judgement and decision making, who in turn provide courses to more than 25,000 individuals across the UK each year; 

-  change Scottish Police Authority Forensic Services’ policy \(by embedding PJDM in standard operating procedures\) and influence the development of internal training programmes to enhance professional judgement among 120 crime scene examiners who make vital decisions at approximately 25,000 crime scenes across Scotland each year; 

-  inform the UK National Organ Retrieval Service’s decision to reassess a proposed reconfiguration which, based on the researchers’ new findings, was predicted to compromise the success of more than 5,000 organs retrieved for transplant each year.

 2. Underpinning research 

 Over the past 16 years, Collins and Martindale have worked together to advance the study of professional judgement and decision making \(PJDM\) expertise in applied sport psychology and sports coaching, and in other hyperdynamic environments beyond sport. Their collaboration continued during Collins’ time away from the University of Edinburgh from 2005\-2019, and since his return. 

 Introducing PJDM to applied sport psychology and sports coaching 

 Collins and Martindale were among the first to promote the need to explore how applied sport psychologists and sports coaches form judgements and make decisions about their practice. Their body of work published from 2005 onwards, which coined the term PJDM, promoted the concept as a way of advancing training, evaluation, and practice for professionals. 

 Collins, Martindale and colleagues’ 2014 paper challenged the prevalent competency\-based training models used in sports science, medicine, and coaching, which focus on observable behaviours to assess practitioners’ development \(3.1\). Their 2018 paper further highlighted the role of PJDM in underpinning an expertise\-based approach for “raising our game” in training applied sport psychologists \(3.2\). Both papers argued that an expertise\-based approach, focused on developing adaptive thinking and professional judgement, would better prepare practitioners. They promoted complex decision making and proactive experimentation as essential for providing consistently optimal support in the dynamic and uncertain contexts of sport. 

 Martindale’s collaborative research published in 2019 explored UK trainee sport and exercise psychologists’ perspectives on developing PJDM expertise \(3.3\). A longitudinal, qualitative data set was established by tracking 7 trainees over a 3\-year training period. Participants reported that the use of experience, analytical reasoning, and observation of other practitioners were useful for accelerating the development of PJDM expertise. The paper re\-iterated an earlier call made by Collins and Martindale to use knowledge elicitation techniques such as applied cognitive task analysis \(ACTA\) to capture and disseminate the knowledge used during experts’ decision making. 

 Collins’ recent collaborative research published in 2020 enabled the development of adventure sport coaches’ PJDM using a structured approach to critical reflection termed the “Big 5” \(B5\) \(3.4\). After training on the B5, 38 Senior Instructors used the approach for a 12\-month period as an experiential method of enhancing PJDM. Following the intervention, interviews were conducted with 4 Heads of Centre and 5 Learning and Adventure Managers who reported that the adventure sport coaching professionals at their centres found the B5 approach to be positive and adaptable to underpin their work in these hyperdynamic, high\-stakes environments. 

 **Applying PJDM research to hyperdynamic environments outside sport** 

 In 2013 the Scottish Police Authority Forensic Services \(SPA FS\) approached Martindale and Collins to identify the cognitive demands on PJDM in crime scene examiners for the first time. Funded by a University of Edinburgh College Knowledge Exchange grant and the Scottish Institute for Policing Research \(SIPR\), the research used ACTA methods to access the knowledge and PJDM of 6 of Scotland’s most senior scene examiners. The methods which helped to identify the cues and strategies needed to effectively perform forensic recovery, included retrospective recall and simulations of crime scenes. The researchers used these data to develop a scenario\-based training tool for crime scene examination response to major incidents and licensed it to SPA FS. The 2017\-published study illuminated how experienced professionals make judgements and decisions at crime scenes \(3.5\). 

 Subsequently, Martindale and colleagues’ further research employed the ACTA methods to identify the cognitive demands on PJDM in transplant surgeons and scrub nurse practitioners, and used a simulation study to assess organ retrieval team performance. Consequently, in 2016 the UK National Organ Retrieval Service \(NORS\) commissioned Martindale, Richards and PhD student Gala Morozova to undertake evaluative research to determine how a proposed change to their service delivery model would affect team performance. The “Vanguard Study” published in 2020 \(3.6\) evaluated the performance of 56 abdominal and 54 cardiothoracic teams attending UK multiorgan retrievals. This was the first large\-scale study in the world to examine human performance during organ retrieval, using data from psychometric scales, qualitative comments, and quantitative outcome measures. Findings identified significant negative impacts of the new model on team performance.

 4. Details of the impact 

 Impact on UK sports coaching policy and practice 

 Collins and Martindale’s research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\) demonstrated the need to improve PJDM training and evaluation for sports practitioners. This influenced the UK Strength and Conditioning Association \(UKSCA\) to incorporate the approach into its systems. In collaboration with the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity, UKSCA have built PJDM and expertise ideas into a new, multi\-tier accreditation process for its more than 2,500 members \[5.1\]. These coaches work in professional sports clubs, institutes and training gyms across the UK. In a December 2020 letter, the UKSCA Executive Officer commended the research for providing a *“strong evidence base which enables us \[UKSCA\] to move beyond the simple competency frameworks which have dominated work in British coaching”.* She also said the research offered *“very practical and face\-valid methods through which these aspects can be operationalised, taught and evaluated”*, which *“impact on the quality and efficacy of training for the vast majority of professional, Olympic and Paralympic athletes”* in the UK \[5.1\]. 

 The UK’s national outdoor centre, Plas y Brenin in Wales, introduced PJDM to its training and assessment of outdoor sports professionals \[5.2\]. The change was a direct consequence of the researchers’ work to establish the value of PJDM development among sports practitioners \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\). The centre provides courses for more than 3,000 people each year, in areas such as climbing and kayaking. 

 In a March 2020 letter, the Plas y Brenin Director of Learning and Development explained the organisation needed *“a strong evidence base to underpin the content and method of our planned \[training\] activities.”* He also stated that the PJDM work provided Plas y Brenin *“with a tool which acknowledges and caters for the full complexity of coaching”* and commended the approach in allowing *“for the hyperdynamic, high stakes environments which characterise adventure sports”* \[5.2\]. 

 Since 2018, The Outward Bound Trust has also applied PJDM approaches set out in the research \(3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\) in its work with more than 25,000 individuals each year. In an April 2020 testimony, the educational charity’s Director of Learning and Adventure wrote: *“Over the past 18 months, our Heads of Centre and Learning and Adventure Managers have been using the PJDM approach and the ‘Big 5’ method as the basis for increased conditionality and consideration in their coaching.”* He also explained how the PJDM approach had encouraged staff to consider *“their own and others’ practice with a critical eye”* \[5.3\]. 

 Impact on crime scene examination policy and practice in Scotland 

 Encouraged by the insight offered by the PJDM research on previously hard\-to\-reach “covert” thought processes, Scottish Police Authority Forensic Services \(SPA FS\) approached Martindale and Collins to expand on their previous work in further, collaborative research that “made thinking visible” by capturing the knowledge and PJDM of highly experienced crime scene examiners \(3.5\). Funded by a GBP9,425 ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant, this project mapped the cognitive demands of a further 6 of Scotland’s most senior scene examiners and, together with SPA FS, considered how these findings could be used to accelerate PJDM expertise in the workforce. 

 This research, which generated an expert knowledge base of over 60% of the Scene Examination Supervisors in Scotland, provided SPA FS with a unique opportunity to invest in their people and incorporate PJDM into multiple facets of the organisation. This research has not only raised understanding of the cognitive demands in crime scene examination, but has led to cultural and policy changes, particularly around the training of scene examiners in Scotland \[5.4\]. Importantly, the increased level of preparedness of 120 crime scene examiners, who attend approximately 25,000 incidents each year, has contributed to the wider Criminal Justice System and to the Public of Scotland. Specifically, the research led to changes in three critical areas: 

1.  It developed a scenario\-based training tool for major incidents which allowed the SPA FS to identify differences in PJDM application and staff proficiency in different geographic regions of Scotland, and focus training needs in these areas. 

1.  It enabled SPA FS to harmonise its approach to major incidents, strengthening and standardising its contribution to police investigations. 

1.  It influenced the development of internal training courses. Since 2018, the SPA FS has delivered a PJDM course for Level 1 Scene Examiners. It also introduced PJDM and scenario\-based training to its 2019\-20 Level 2 course on serious and major crime \[5.4, 5.5\]. 

 In April 2019, SPA FS revised its pay and reward staff evaluation process to include an assessment of PJDM activities \[5.5\]. In the same month, SPA FS’ Head of Scene Examination wrote: *“we have been able to harmonise our initial approach to complex and major incidents which has strengthened and simplified team\-working dynamics, and improved effective deployment of resources from different areas \[and\] has standardised our contribution to the Police investigation, \[as\] evidenced by positive feedback from our Criminal Justice partners”* \[5.5\]. 

 Impact on policy and practice in UK organ retrieval teams 

 The Vanguard Study \(3.6\), which was supported by a GBP7127 ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant, has increased the understanding and awareness of how proposed changes to the NORS delivery model affect staff from a performance psychology perspective. The research informed policy recommendations that all 16 NORS teams across the UK should remain in standard configuration rather than adopt the new model. This research demonstrated that NORS teams were better able to cope in the standard configuration compared to the new model, and that the proposed change would likely have a negative impact on NORS staff capacity to achieve and maintain high performance standards in this highly pressured environment. 

 The “Update on Vanguard Project” report presented to the NORS Workforce Transformation Project Board cites the performance psychology research carried out by the Human Performance Science research group at the University of Edinburgh and highlights that this robust methodology informed their recommendation to remain in standard configuration \[5.6\]. In February 2018, the Retrieval and Transplant Project Lead Specialist noted that *“this was the first behavioural research project ever undertaken within the UK organ retrieval service, which is a major innovation”* \[5.6\]. 

 Without the Vanguard Study there would be no evidence to determine the correct way forward, so this research has directly informed the decision making of NORS. The health implications are significant given that effective retrieval is essential for these organs to be preserved and viable for transplantation. More than 5,000 organs are retrieved for transplant in the UK each year, which saves lives and improves people’s quality of life. The NORS Service Lead wrote: *“The Vanguard Study… developed an entirely new evidence base which allowed clear decisions to be made about implementation”.* They also explained: “ *this study was a landmark in establishing the role of performance research in shaping retrieval practice”* \[5.7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at SOAS on post\-civil war relations between the Tamil diaspora and the Sri Lankan state directly contributed to a ‘radical change’ – according to legal experts – in UK asylum law and policy in 2013: namely, recognition of participants in lawful Tamil diaspora\-based political activity as a key and novel category of persons ‘at risk’ of harm if returned, despite the war’s end. Recognition of this ‘at risk’ category has provided thousands of Tamils who engage in lawful protests and advocacy against the Sri Lankan authorities with new or additional grounds for seeking protection, thus also enabling their continued participation in democratic political life in the UK. The research also directly contributed to positive outcomes in dozens of individual Tamils' asylum claims, and the UK’s recognition of the ‘at risk’ category influenced asylum claims by Tamils in other countries, in particular Australia and France. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Sri Lanka’s civil war ended in 2009 with the total military destruction of the Liberation of Tigers of Tamil Eelam \(LTTE\). In the final year of the war, mass atrocities by the Sri Lankan security forces prompted unprecedented mobilisation by both first\- and second\-generation diaspora Tamils in mass protests and civil society advocacy campaigns. Following the war’s end, the UK sharply reduced eligible ‘at risk’ categories for Tamils seeking asylum and stepped up returns of rejected claimants. The UK’s reasoning, shared by other western governments, was that human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities related to their efforts to defeat the LTTE insurgency. On this view, now the LTTE was no more, Tamils who had participated whilst abroad in lawful campaigns and protests against the Sri Lankan authorities, were not at risk of harm if returned, as any adverse attention from the authorities would relate to suspected support for renewed insurgency. 

 Long\-term ethnographic research conducted at SOAS since 2008 by Dr Suthaharan Nadarajah **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4\]** on the Tamil diaspora’s evolving transnational political activities and its relations with host\-country governments and the Sri Lankan authorities, has served as basis for consequential country\-related expertise provided in UK asylum procedures from 2013 to date. The Tamil diaspora is a classic ‘conflict generated’ diaspora, expanding through waves of refugee flight from the start of Sri Lanka’s civil war in 1983. For example, by 2011 over 130,000 Tamils from Sri Lanka had claimed asylum in the UK alone. Nadarajah’s research examines the social and political circumstances and state policies in both Sri Lanka and western countries which both influence and are influenced by Tamil diaspora political activism. Outputs include analyses of Sri Lankan security practices **\[3.2\]**, contingent workings of western terrorism proscription regimes **\[3.1\]**, international anti\-terrorism practices’ influence on diaspora agency **\[3.4\]**, and co\-analysis with Mark Laffey \(SOAS\), building on Nadarajah’s research on the Tamil diaspora, of the production of hybrid subjectivities at ‘home’ and ‘abroad’ by the institutions and practices of liberal peace **\[3.3\]**. 

 Against the above assumptions prevailing in UK asylum law and policy, Nadarajah’s research identified and explained key post\-war shifts in Sri Lankan national security policy and practices that were producing new patterns of human rights abuses, especially in relation to Tamil diaspora activism **\[3.1, 3.2\]**. Three insights from the research were important for UK asylum law and policy: 

  

 1\) the Sri Lankan authorities’ post\-war adverse attention now also focussed on lawful Tamil diaspora political activities quite distinct from support for renewed armed violence. In other words, ‘support for terrorism’, on the authorities’ view, encompassed diaspora political campaigns such as those advocating for international accountability for war crimes; demilitarisation of \(troop withdrawals from\) Tamil\-majority areas; Tamil self\-determination by non\-violent means \(e.g. referenda\); among other aspects. 

 2\) the Sri Lankan security forces and intelligence agencies were now violently targeting returning Tamils who had, or were suspected to have, participated in lawful activities such as gathering testimony from survivors of and eyewitnesses to war crimes and human rights abuses; assisting the work of international human rights groups, UN investigators.; demonstrating against the Sri Lankan government’s policies; commemorating Tamil victims of ‘genocide’. 

 3\) it was the increasing integration of prominent Tamil diaspora groups into western states’ policy making on Sri Lanka that made them serious threats to national security on the view of the Sri Lankan authorities. Increasingly forceful pressure by the international community led by Tamil diaspora\-hosting western states \(hitherto close allies in the ‘war on terror’\) was placed on the Sri Lankan government to reach a political settlement on Tamil demands for self\-rule, demilitarise Tamil\-majority areas, and, especially, prosecute state perpetrators of wartime mass atrocities. The Sri Lankan government attributed these international demands – all deemed assaults on the country’s sovereignty and independence – primarily to the malign influence of Tamil diaspora activism on western governments’ policy decisions. 

 Taken together, the research showed how and why, on the view of the Sri Lankan authorities, the primary post\-war threat to the country’s national security, sovereignty and territorial integrity is diaspora Tamils’ seemingly growing ability to mobilise international pressure on and action against them, rather than actual or potential support for revived insurgency in Sri Lanka **\[3.1\]**. 

 In 2013, Nadarajah elaborated these insights in an expert report and oral testimony for the UK’s immigration and asylum Upper Tribunal \(high court\) hearing of a designated ‘country guidance’ case on Sri Lanka, resulting in the addition of Tamils involved in diaspora\-based ‘Tamil separatism’ as a key and novel category ‘at risk’ of harm if returned to Sri Lanka **\[3.2\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Nadarajah’s work had wide and significant impact on, first, asylum protection in the UK for Tamils from Sri Lanka, by influencing directly a key change in UK asylum law and Home Office policy guidance in 2013–2014, which influenced the submission, assessment, and Tribunal determinations on claims by thousands of Tamil asylum seekers thereafter. Second, the protection extended by this change in asylum law and policy enabled the continued participation of Tamil asylum seekers and other non\-resident Tamils in lawful political advocacy and democratic life in the UK. The change in UK law and Home Office policy, which remains in place in July 2020, has influenced Sri Lankan Tamils’ asylum claims in other countries, in particular Australia and France. 

####  Influencing changes in asylum law and policy guidance on Sri Lanka 

 Nadarajah’s research, provided as expert evidence in a written report **\[3.2\]** and oral testimony to the UK’s immigration and asylum Upper Tribunal \(UKUT\), directly influenced its landmark determination in July 2013 on a designated Sri Lanka Country Guidance case **\[5.1\]**. To the co\-lead advocate for the appellants at the hearing, it was ‘clear from a comparison of Dr Nadarajah’s evidence with the conclusions reached by the Upper Tribunal . . . that the Tribunal relied heavily on his evidence for many of the key features of its conclusions . . . All of these were key features of the guidance which the Tribunal gave \[in its determination\] and which continue to shape the way in which asylum claims by Sri Lankan Tamils are assessed’ **\[5.3 pp2–3\]**. 

 By identifying and explaining important but hitherto unrecognized shifts in post\-war Sri Lankan national security policy and practices, the analysis presented in Nadarajah’s expert evidence challenged key assumptions underpinning the UK’s asylum policy, and directly influenced the Tribunal’s hugely consequential finding that participation in lawful Tamil diaspora political activism in the UK could put individuals at risk of harm from the Sri Lankan authorities. The UKUT’s recognition of this distinct and novel ‘at risk’ category in its determination, which extensively cited Nadarajah’s expert report and oral testimony **\[3.1, paras 148–164 & Appendix K, paras 22–56\]**, was described by legal experts as producing a ‘radical change’ in the UK Home Office’s and asylum Tribunals’ assessment of risk of return to Sri Lanka **\[5.6 p3\]**. 

 This recognition was of very high significance because a Country Guidance \(CG\) determination by the UKUT becomes the authoritative finding on the ‘country guidance issues’ specified in the determination, unless superseded by a subsequent CG determination. A Tribunal determination that fails to follow the country guidance or to show why it does not apply to the case in question can be appealed on a point of law. The Home Office publishes the CG findings in policy guidance for its decision makers, who are expected to apply them when assessing asylum claims. **\[5.3\]**. 

 The key, and novel, ‘country guidance issue’ identified in the 2013 CG determination was that “individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a threat to the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they are, or are perceived to have a significant role in relation to post\-conflict Tamil separatism *within the diaspora*” were “at real risk of persecution or serious harm on return to Sri Lanka”, as “the \[Sri Lanka\] government’s present objective is to identify Tamil activists in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism and to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state” **\[5.1 p2, emphasis added\]**. The co\-lead advocate for the appellants considered “Dr Nadarajah’s contribution to \[this finding\] as absolutely crucial in assisting the Tribunal to understand the attitudes of the Sri Lankan government, the dynamics of the Tamil diaspora, and the risks to those perceived as \[Tamil\] separatists in the event of a return to Sri Lanka” **\[5.3 p3\]**. 

 After the 2013 CG determination was upheld by the Court of Appeal, in August 2014, the CG was published by the Home Office in new policy guidance for asylum decision\-makers, titled ‘Sri Lanka: Tamil Separatism’ **\[5.2\]**. Nadarajah’s analysis of the country context in his 2013 expert evidence to the Upper Tribunal proved prescient, as in April 2014 the Sri Lankan authorities proscribed almost all the leading Tamil diaspora advocacy groups as terrorists, invoking UN anti\-terrorism instruments. While these bans were summarily rejected by western states as lacking any evidentiary basis **\[3.1\]**, the most direct protection for politically active non\-resident Tamils in the UK is that provided by the 2013 ‘at risk’ category changes in asylum law and policy **\[5.7 p6\]**. 

 In December 2020, the 2013 CG determination remained the authoritative legal guidance on Sri Lanka for asylum Tribunals, and current Home Office policy guidance, though revised, remained largely consistent with that issued in 2014 **\[5.5, 5.6\]**. In April 2020, Nadarajah was commissioned to provide extensive written and oral evidence to assist the UKUT to update its authoritative guidance on Sri Lanka. The determination of the new Country Guidance case, heard in September, is awaited. Whereas in 2013 a Tribunal\-recognised ‘Interested Party’, Tamils Against Genocide \(TAG\) **\[5.4\]**, instructed Nadarajah’s expert evidence, in 2020 he was jointly instructed by legal representatives of the main parties, the Home Office and the appellants **\[5.5 p3\]**. 

####  Improving access to asylum protection for Tamils in the UK 

 CG determinations directly shape subsequent assessments of asylum claims by the Home Office and the Tribunals. The senior asylum lawyer and barrister who was co\-lead advocate for the appellants at the 2013 CG Sri Lanka hearing stated the determination was “of crucial significance in identifying the categories of Tamil applicants now adjudged entitled to be granted asylum in the UK” **\[5.3 p.2\]**. A senior lawyer specialising in Sri Lankan cases stated “in the past seven years thousands of Tamils who have sought asylum in the UK and Europe and in several common law jurisdictions … have had their claims assessed using \[the 2013 CG\] as the guidance case. Many are among those who have participated in Tamil diaspora political activities. Others have given evidence to international human rights groups and UN investigations,” **\[5.6 p3\]** \(see below\). 

 Given the standing asylum law and policy guidance, Home Office rejections, claimants’ appeals and tribunal decisions since 2013 often centre on whether the applicant meets the standard set \(but not specified\) by the 2013 CG determination of ‘a significant role’ in ‘Tamil separatism’ \(as perceived by the Sri Lankan authorities\) in relation to Tamil diaspora activism **\[5.5\]**. In this regard, Nadarajah was regularly commissioned by lawyers representing Tamil asylum seekers to provide the courts with expert reports explaining how risk to the individual in the country context at the time of the hearing related to that recognised in the 2013 CG determination. From 2014 to July 2020, he provided over 40 expert reports to asylum Tribunals based on his research. Many of his expert reports were relied on by the Tribunal for their decisions. A lawyer specialising in Sri Lankan cases stated “Dr Nadarajah’s reports have not only been central to positive determinations of asylum appeals, but also played a key role in stopping deportations, obtaining rights to appeal negative decisions through judicial review, and immigration bail.” **\[5.5 p2\]**. 

####  Improving capabilities and practices of UK asylum lawyers 

 Nadarajah’s research also directly influenced the work of UK asylum law practitioners representing Tamil asylum seekers from Sri Lanka. One senior asylum lawyer described Nadarajah’s 2018 article **\[3.1\]** as “excellent”, explaining that “legal practitioners would deﬁnitely beneﬁt from this being publicly available. We struggle to get legal aid granted for country expert reports at times and so this would be a great alternative for initial asylum applications relying on the political issues in Sri Lanka” **\[5.9\].** Based on such feedback, the article was published open access with SOAS’s funding in August 2018 and has been downloaded over 3,000 times as of July 2020. The article, along with Nadarajah’s newly commissioned expert report was included in the evidence jointly submitted by the Home Office’s and appellant’s lawyers to the Upper Tribunal hearing of the 2020 Country Guidance \(Sri Lanka\) case. 

 Nadarajah’s research also influenced asylum lawyers’ case preparation and arguments made before Tribunals, both via expert reports he produced \(including for the 2013 and 2020 CG cases, and dozens of individuals’ cases from 2015 to July 2020 **\[5.4, 5.5, 5.6\]**\), and via training courses he conducted for 50 UK immigration lawyers specialising in Tamil cases. A public statement of appreciation by Duncan Lewis, a leading UK law firm, described Nadarajah’s training as ‘much needed and very welcome’ for their staff, and the research he presented as “of the utmost importance to any legal practitioner representing Sri Lankan asylum seekers” **\[5.8 p3\]**. 

####  Widening participation by Tamil asylum seekers in UK political processes and international investigations 

 Through his direct impact on UK asylum law and policy, Nadarajah’s work significantly influenced the ability of non\-resident Tamils in the UK to participate in democratic life here. Recognition of Tamil diaspora political activists as an ‘at risk on return’ category from 2013 to July 2020, has encouraged individuals who previously may have been dissuaded by fear of reprisals from the Sri Lankan authorities after being deported to participate in a range of lawful political activities. 

 A senior editor with Tamil Guardian \(the leading English\-language Tamil diaspora news website\), stated that within a year of the 2013 CG determination “the significant protections from harm by the Sri Lankan authorities provided in \[it\] had far reaching effects on Tamil diaspora political activity by encouraging several hundred Tamils awaiting decisions on their asylum claims to join major Tamil diaspora advocacy groups, and hundreds of others to participate in demonstrations and other public activities,” **\[5.7 p7\]**. This is despite such events routinely being videoed and photographed by Sri Lankan embassy officials, and in 2014 the Sri Lankan government banning these Tamil diaspora groups as terrorists. **\[5.7, 3.1\]**. 

 Similarly, the Director of TAG \(Together Against Genocide, a prominent Tamil human rights and transitional justice NGO\) Janani Jananayagam stated “due to the increased sense of protection provided by \[the 2013 CG determination\]” Tamil asylum seekers who had witnessed war crimes by Sri Lankan security forces and “who previously had been reluctant, were persuaded to now come forward and give evidence” **\[5.4 p9\]**; Dozens of witnesses gave evidence to TAG and many more others to other international human rights groups and the landmark UN investigation \(2014–2015\) by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. **\[5.4, pp8\-10\]**. 

####  Influencing decisions on Tamils’ asylum claims in Australia, France, and Luxembourg 

 The 2013 change in UK asylum law and policy guidance on Sri Lanka has influenced Tamils’ asylum claims in other countries. A senior UK lawyer stated “Dr Nadarajah’s research, which the UKUT relied on for its country guidance in the \[2013 CG\] determination, has also contributed to increasing international protection for politically active individuals in the Tamil diaspora in many countries including Australia, France, and Luxembourg.” **\[5.6 p4\]**. An analysis in 2016 of the influence of the UKUT’s CG determinations on Australia’s asylum courts showed that the 2013 determination on Sri Lanka had been “by far the most frequently\-used country guidance decision in Australia . . . No other decision of the UKUT . . . has enjoyed similar currency” **\[5.10 p5, p8\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Damaged peatlands account for 5% of all global Greenhouse Gas emissions, making their restoration a key target for achieving net zero emissions. Newcastle University research contributed to the design and implementation of the UK’s first ever ecosystem market for peatland restoration, the Peatland Code, generating >£300 million public and private investment in restoration to meet climate targets. Research then extended to other ecosystems in the UK, Italy and Hungary, leveraging a further £5M private investment in regenerative agriculture and conservation. This work also significantly shaped the work of the United Nations’ Global Peatland Initiative to establish baseline evidence of peatland condition as a basis for global action, and was instrumental in securing international resolutions that led to the creation of new peatland policies in 29 countries.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Current rates of global land degradation are estimated to be 10\-12 million hectares per year and this is being exacerbated by the effects of climate change, leading to food insecurity for billions of people in some of the poorest countries of the world. Newcastle research provided the international policy community with the most comprehensive analysis of links between land degradation and climate change at the time, driving international policy decisions. Subsequent research considered these links in global peatlands, which contain twice as much carbon as all the world's forests. Damage to peatlands is causing significant greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 10% of emissions from global land use and 5% of the total global carbon budget. In the UK, peatlands are the country’s largest carbon store, containing more carbon than the forests of France and Germany combined. However, over 80% of the country’s peatlands are degraded and therefore a substantial source of Greenhouse Gas emissions from the land use sector \(second only to agriculture\). This presents a major challenge for reaching net zero targets under the Paris Agreement, given that the cost of restoring these peatlands is far in excess of the available public funding, both in the UK and in countries with peatlands around the world. 

 Newcastle research \[R1\] underpinned the development of the UK Peatland Code \(version 1.1, published 2017\), enabling private investment in peatland restoration in return for the climate mitigation benefits of healthy peatlands for the first time. The research \[R1\] provided the first full description of an operational Code and its scientific basis in the peer\-reviewed research literature. It used the Code to propose a place\-based approach to Payments for Ecosystem Services, enabling multi\-level governance to mitigate negative trade\-offs between ecosystem services and engage with and empower diverse stakeholders in scheme design and governance. 

 Building on research findings from R1, Reed led the Valuing Nature Programme’s Peatland Tipping Points project between 2017 and 2019 with Stewart, Young and Whittingham, and project partner IUCN UK Peatland Programme who own and manage the Peatland Code \(Prof Reed is their Research Lead\), informing the ongoing development of the Code and its wider adoption in the UK and internationally. This led to research commissioned by Natural England, led by Reed with Hansda, Garrod, Proctor, Collins and PhD student Heidi Saxby, on social barriers to the adoption of peatland restoration and sustainable management practices to inform the development of the England Peat Strategy \[R2\]. Based on 50 interviews, photo survey and deliberative valuation workshops in five English peatlands, the research provided insights into social drivers of behavioural change including place identity and attachment and the need for message framing that is consistent with the identity, values, norms and beliefs of landowners and managers. 

 Following this work, research from the Global Food Security programme’s Resilient Dairy Landscapes project \(led by Reed with Stewart, Rodgers and Kendall\) showed how private schemes like the Peatland Code could integrate with agricultural payment schemes to avoid competition between public and private funding. This project tested and helped develop Landscape Enterprise Networks \(LENs\) in collaboration with 3Keel, Nestle and other partners, showing how they could be integrated with green finance and national carbon markets like the Peatland Code and Woodland Carbon Code \[R3\], following R1’s place\-based approach to Payments for Ecosystem Services. 

 In parallel with this, the team worked with the United Nations Environment Programme\-led Global Peatlands Initiative to pioneer the development of core common outcomes for peatland research and monitoring, to standardise data for future research synthesis and mapping \[R4\] and with the UN Convention to Combat Desertification \(UNCCD\) to provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of links between land degradation and climate change \[R5\]. Building on this, in collaboration with the UNCCD and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research \(CGIAR\), Prof Reed helped to co\-ordinate research on upscaling restoration and sustainable land management, leading to an official Global Land Outlook working paper and journal article that helped shape the UNCCD’s first Global Land Outlook \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impact 1: UK peatland policy** 

 Research at Newcastle University contributed to the development and implementation of the Peatland Code \[R1\], the first private Payment for Ecosystem Service scheme of its kind in the UK. The Code supplements public funding with new private investment for restoration, paying landowners to restore land in return for the climate and other benefits of healthy peatlands. Since Prof Reed moved to Newcastle University in 2016, he has helped lead the Peatland Code from its pilot phase to a fully functioning national carbon market: 

 *“Prof Reed’s research at Newcastle University has been instrumental in the development and operation of the Peatland Code. His paper in* Global Environmental Change *and subsequent research on the Peatland Code and ecosystem markets, alongside his role as Research Lead for IUCN UK Peatland Programme and on the Executive Board of the Peatland Code, have played an important role in establishing the credibility of the Code, and driving funding and uptake in the policy and investment community.”* \[S1\] 

 So far, four privately funded projects to restore peatlands have been validated or are in the process of validation \(confirming emission reductions of 101,944 tCO<sub>2e</sub> over their lifetime\), with a further 20 projects initiated, covering 4,232 hectares of damaged peatlands across England, Scotland and Wales \[S2\]. It has been estimated by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s \(IUCN\) UK Peatland Programme that together, these projects will avoid the loss of at least 570,000 tCO<sub>2e</sub> of peat stocks to the atmosphere \[S1\], equivalent to taking 230,000 flights from London to Sydney. Interest from the corporate sector in peatland carbon has grown rapidly since the inception of the Code, with demand from investors seeking to mitigate climate change now far outstripping the supply of projects \[S1\]. 

 Research on the Peatland Code \[R1, R2, R3\] has made “ *a highly significant contribution to the policy landscape in the UK with respect to peatland restoration*”, according to Defra’s Head of Peatland Strategy & Recovery \[S5\]. The IUCN UK Peatland Programme Leader explained the breadth of the policy influence of Newcastle peatland research \[S1\]: 

 *“During his time at Newcastle, Prof Reed’s research significantly informed and shaped peatland policy, enabling civil servants and parliamentarians in each of the four UK countries to prioritise funding for peatland restoration. This included direct input to the structure and content of the UK Peatland Strategy, which has been applauded by Governments, UN agencies and NGOs internationally as a world leading approach to peatland conservation. This strategy in turn has driven the creation of peatland policies and strategies in each of the UK countries, leading to investment in peatland across the country, including £250M committed in Scotland over the next 10 years”.* 

 The research shaped two major investments in peatland restoration by Defra in England and key elements of the England Peat Strategy, as well as further investment by Welsh Government and the EU LIFE fund. Building on this success, peatland restoration was integrated into Defra’s 2020 Nature for Climate Fund \(funding nature\-based solutions to climate change\), as a direct result of findings from Newcastle’s Peatland Tipping Points project that were used in the Committee for Climate Change’s \(CCC\) 2020 Land Use Report \(Prof Reed is acknowledged as a member of the expert advisory group for the report\) \[S5\]. Defra’s Head of Peatland Strategy & Recovery stated \[S5\]: 

 *“Defra successfully secured funding \[redacted\] for peatland restoration as part of the Nature for Climate Fund’s historic goal to restore 35,000 hectares of damaged peatland in England. This decision was influenced by the peatland recommendations in the CCC Land Use report, which was heavily reliant on findings from the Valuing Nature Programme’s Peatland Tipping Points project led by Prof Reed in collaboration with Julia Martin\-Ortega \(University of Leeds\), Klaus Glenk \(SRUC\) and colleagues. We ensured Defra’s analysis on costs were comparable with the CCC report. Defra consulted Prof Reed and his team and, based on their research, advised Natural England on options to ensure the peatland scheme prioritises projects using the Peatland Code and effectively integrates private and public funding for restoration.”* 

 This built on the success of Defra’s first stand\-alone peatland restoration scheme, which was secured as a result of Newcastle research during a period when Defra’s budget was being significantly cut. Defra’s Head of Soils at the time stated \[S4\]: *“Defra was able to secure more than £10M for peatland restoration in the context of an austerity budget \(distributed via grants in 2017\), as a direct result of evidence from the research underpinning the Peatland Code that was led by Professor Mark Reed from Newcastle University.”* 

 The research has also shaped Defra peatland policy, as detailed by Defra’s Head of Peatland Strategy & Recovery \[S5\]: 

 “*Prof Reed’s research has also informed further policy changes in the form of the England Peat Strategy. Professor Reed’s research \(notably research commissioned by Natural England\)* \[R3\] *played a particularly important role in shaping the commitments that have so far been announced from the England Peatland Strategy, which it is hoped will be published in 2021. This includes our approach to stakeholder engagement around the design and purpose of the lowland agricultural peat task force, which prioritises farmer engagement from the outset.”* 

 Private investment in Peatland Code projects also leveraged public funding as part of a £1M Welsh Peatlands Sustainable Management Scheme, and a £5.6M European Pennine PeatLIFE project in northern England. According to the Welsh scheme co\-ordinator, *“The Peatland Code has been integral to the success of the 1M Welsh Peatlands Sustainable Management Scheme, funded by Welsh Government, giving us the opportunity to leverage additional funding for peatland restoration”* \[S3\] 

 Finally, this work also informed the development of ecosystem markets in other systems across the UK and Europe via Landscape Enterprise Networks \(LENs\), an open\-source platform pioneered by 3Keel and Nestle in collaboration with the Newcastle\-led Resilient Dairy Landscapes project \[S6, R3, R4\]. LENs enables businesses with regional interests to co\-invest in regenerative farming and conservation to deliver benefits for their business, local farmers and society. There are now six LENs landscapes channelling private investment into sustainable agriculture and nature conservation in England, Scotland, Italy and Hungary, with investment totalling £5M to date \[S6\]. The LENs landscapes in Cumbria and SW Scotland work with >80 farmers covering 8% Scottish and 2% UK dairy output, with other LENs landscapes focusing on arable farming and catchment management \[S6\]. The Head of Value Chain Sustainability for Nestle UK and Ireland explained the importance of the research in developing and rolling out LENs \[S6\]: 

 *“The Resilient Dairy Landscapes project led by Professor Reed was crucial for the development of LENs as an open\-source platform, which along with the academic rigour and analysis provided by the research, has enabled uptake of LENs across the UK as well as prominence in English policy \(LENs featured prominently in Defra’s 25 year plan\) and Scottish Policy \(LENs is one of the most developed pillars of SEPA \[Scottish Environmental Protection Agency\] and Scottish Wildlife Trust’s £1 billion challenge initiative\). Social science from the project has helped us design schemes to drive farmer uptake, and evidence on the multifunctional benefits of interventions has helped drive interest from a wide range of investors.”* 

 **Impact 2: International peatland policy** 

 Newcastle University research on peatlands and links between land degradation and climate change significantly shaped UNCCD decisions, the work of the United Nations’ Global Peatland Initiative, and was instrumental in securing international resolutions that led to the creation of new peatland policies in 29 countries. 

 Prof Reed was commissioned by the UNCCD to publish a report and book \[R5\] which was quoted in official UNCCD documents \(ICCD/CST\(S\-4/3\) and ICCD/COP\(12\)/CST/2\) feeding into UNCCD COP12. According to the UNCCD’s Lead Scientist \[S9\]: “ *The Newcastle team, led by Prof Reed, has worked with the UNCCD to provide the most comprehensive analysis at the time of links between land degradation and climate change… The research led to the recommendations made by the SPI \[Science Policy Interface\] and the CST \[Committee on Science and Technology\], which were subsequently enshrined in Decisions made by the COP.”* These decisions included: 1\) recognition for the first time of the importance of links between climate change and land degradation \(Paragraph 2 of Decision 18/COP.12\); and 2\) a decision to ask the UNCCD’s Science Policy Interface to further explore these links \[S10\]. This decision led the CST to propose a special report on climate change and land to IPCC \(published in 2019\). This report helped shape negotiations in COP14 \(2019\) that led to a target for countries who are party to the convention to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030. 

 Newcastle peatland research is being used by the Global Peatlands Initiative \(GPI\), led by UN Environment Programme with partners including the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\) and the Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\), to standardise restoration monitoring of the most important climatic, hydrological and biodiversity “core outcomes” from peatlands. This is important because currently different variables are monitored in different ways, making it difficult to base policy or practice on evidence synthesis or integrate data to create global baselines or maps. The GPI Coordinator explained the significance of the work \[S7\]: *“…one of the core tasks of the GPI is to create baseline evidence of peatland condition as a basis for global action. The approach we have been able to pioneer with Newcastle University has been central to this work, identifying and reaching consensus on core outcomes for tropical peatland research and monitoring. CIFOR subsequently ran a series of workshops building on this approach with FAO, the Government of Indonesia, and UNEP with support from Norway and USA. We will also be integrating the approach in the next edition of the IPCC wetlands supplement, which is used by Governments around the world to guide emissions reporting to the UNFCCC.”* 

 Newcastle research also played a major role in securing international resolutions on peatlands, garnering international consensus on the importance of restoring and sustainably managing peatlands. The implementation of these resolutions has been monitored by staff seconded from Newcastle University to the IUCN UK Peatland Programme \(Young and Ojo\) in collaboration with the Global Peatlands Initiative, leading to evidence of significant changes in peatland policy around the world \[S8\]. According to the GPI Coordinator \[S7\]: 

 *“Prof Reed’s research on peatland policy and the Peatland Code with IUCN UK Peatland Programme was pivotal in securing IUCN Resolution 43 “Securing a future for global peatlands” in September 2016. The research was important because it showed how Governments could share the financial burden of restoration with the private sector. The resolution specifically references the work of the IUCN UK Peatland Programme, which Newcastle research informed. This resolution in turn paved the way for Ramsar Resolution XIII.13 on restoring degraded peatlands and the UN Environment Assembly’s resolution 4/16 “Conservation and sustainable management of peatlands”*. 

 The GPI Coordinator \[S7\] also confirmed the importance of these resolutions in driving the creation of new peatland policies worldwide: *“We worked together with the Newcastle team to conduct joint resolution reporting between IUCN, Ramsar and UNEA for the first time* \[S8\] *, and this showed that since the original IUCN resolution, new strategies and policies were introduced to protect peatlands in 29 countries, which together represent the majority of global peatland emissions”.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The University of Oxford’s INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Project, involving nearly 70,000 mothers and babies worldwide, has produced clinical tools to diagnose impaired growth and development in pregnancy and infancy, which standardise care for mothers and their babies. These international standards replace multiple local reference charts and provide benchmarks for health professionals everywhere: for example, by establishing the standard for microcephaly that was recommended by the World Health Organization \(WHO\) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the 2016 Zika virus outbreak. 

 For low\-to\-middle income countries, these standards have led to a reinterpretation of the number of deaths attributed to neonates born small for their gestational age. The INTERGROWTH\-21st Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards and feeding protocol have also been implemented by 370 neonatal units globally. 

 The standards are based on the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Project’s landmark finding: healthy mothers have babies that grow in a similar way in utero and achieve a similar size at birth, irrespective of their ancestry, ethnicity or place of birth. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The International Fetal & Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Project \(INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup>\) is a large, multicentre, population\-based research initiative, led by Professors Stephen Kennedy, José Villar and Aris Papageorghiou \(University of Oxford\). This work was done by a multidisciplinary network of more than 300 health care professionals and scientists from 35 institutions in 21 countries. Villar and Kennedy designed the studies, coordinated the network, managed the project, and analysed the data. Papageorghiou led the ultrasound and clinical dissemination components of the project. 

 The project, involving nearly 70,000 mothers and babies worldwide, was established to assess human growth, development and associated behaviours from early pregnancy to two years of age under: i\) healthy conditions \(Phase I\) and ii\) various sub\-optimal conditions \(e.g., maternal infections, malnutrition and pregnancy complications\) and other risk factors for adverse outcomes \(Phase II, currently ongoing\). The project’s guiding principle was that the main adverse perinatal outcomes \- fetal death, preterm birth and fetal growth restriction \- are highly heterogeneous, inter\-related syndromes that require targeted interventions focused on the underlying causes. 

 Phase I of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Project, conducted between 2009 \- 2016, consisted of five complementary studies designed to describe optimal human growth and development. The studies were based on the World Health Organization \(WHO\) prescriptive approach and took place across eight urban areas worldwide: these were geographically delimited to ensure the project was population\-based \[1\]. The study team tracked fetal growth throughout pregnancy from <14 weeks gestation in a large cohort of healthy women and continued to monitor their infants prospectively until they were two years old. At both population and individual levels, the participants had the recommended health, nutritional and socio\-economic status needed to produce international standards: the women were generally healthy, well\-nourished, and well\-educated, living freely in environments with minimal constraints on fetal growth, and receiving standardised, evidence\-based antenatal care. 

 The principal findings of the project are that early human growth and development are similar across diverse geographical settings when mothers’ nutritional and health needs are met, and environmental constraints on growth are low. These findings have a very strong public health message: healthy mothers have babies that grow in a similar way in utero and achieve a similar size at birth, irrespective of their ancestry, ethnicity, or place of birth \[2\]. 

 These studies led to the construction of a set of international standards for monitoring mothers and babies, using the WHO recommended prescriptive approach \[3, 4, 5\]. These include tools for: 1\) estimating gestational age in early and late pregnancy; 2\) monitoring gestational weight gain; 3\) measuring symphyseal\-fundal height \(SFH\); 4\) measuring fetal size and estimated fetal weight with ultrasound to monitor intrauterine growth; 5\) evaluating newborn size at birth, and 6\) monitoring the postnatal growth of preterm infants. Uniquely, the same healthy cohort was used to produce the entire set of tools \- the largest population ever assembled for such a longitudinal study. This is also the first time that a uniform method to describe fetal health and growth up to two years of age had been developed. 

 The children whose intrauterine ultrasound growth data were used to construct the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Fetal Growth Standards remained healthy with satisfactory growth and motor development up to two years of age, supporting the use of this cohort to construct international standards. 

 The INTER\-NDA tool, developed specifically for this project, was used to assess the sequence and timing of attainment of key neurodevelopmental milestones and associated behaviours among these children at two years of age, for implementation by non\-specialists across international settings. The children’s developmental patterns were similar across these geographically diverse populations in keeping with the associated low health, nutritional and environmental risks \[6\]. 

 These international standards, which perfectly complement the existing WHO Child Growth Standards, provide a unique set of clinical tools for use across all healthcare systems to diagnose impaired growth and development and standardise the care of pregnant women and their infants across the world.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Global uptake of INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards**In 2016, the team began the INTERPRACTICE\-21<sup>st</sup> Project to scale up global implementation of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards \[5\]. WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) have both recommended use of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards and feeding protocols \[A\]. As of 31 July 2020, 370 neonatal units around the world have implemented the standards and protocols in countries including Dubai, Haiti, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the USA. The standards and protocols have also been adopted by national paediatric and neonatal societies and Ministries of Health, for example the National Paediatric Society of Argentina and the Italian Society of Neonatology. The standards seek to reduce the overdiagnosis of extrauterine growth restriction, which results in overfeeding that can lead to obesity and cardiometabolic disease in adulthood. Monitoring preterm infants with the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards, which describe optimal postnatal growth, reduces the risk of overfeeding. The feeding protocols detail how to feed a preterm infant, emphasising the use of human milk. 

####  UK Clinical Guidelines 

 In 2018, following an analysis of evidence to prevent stillbirths, the Scottish Government recommended the use of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Symphyseal\-fundal Height \(SFH\) Standards and Fetal Growth Standards for monitoring pregnancies \[3\]. A letter in November 2018 from the Children and Families Directorate of the Scottish Government, to Chief Executives, Medical Directors and Nurse Directors \[B\] states that *“The expert Scottish Government led Stillbirth Group has reviewed current evidence around accuracy of charts and recommends the use of Intergrowth 21<sup>st</sup> SFH and ultrasound growth charts which are free to use and readily available….”.* 

####  Use in perinatal patient data management and the Neonatology GIRFT project 

 The INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards, describing how a preterm infant should grow, have been integrated into BadgerNet, the pregnancy and neonatal unit data management system widely used across the NHS for the collection, storage and reporting of perinatal patient data. The raw data available in the BadgerNet system are being used by the Neonatology GIRFT Project to benchmark the extent to which preterm infants are growing optimally and to provide feedback to neonatal units on how well their patients are growing against the standards. The GIRFT Clinical Lead for Neonatology highlights how the data are being used: *“Thank you so much for providing GIRFT Neonatology with Z scores from both the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards and Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards for all premature babies admitted to neonatal units in England for the three year period 2016\-19. I have used the data to develop some benchmarking metrics to review growth between admission and discharge for babies at different gestational ages”* \[C\] *.* 

####  Establishing international standards for microcephaly 

 During the 2016 Zika virus \(ZIKV\) outbreak in Brazil the use of the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards redefined the definition of microcephaly and led to changes in global practice and guidelines. On 8 December 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health changed its definition of microcephaly from head circumference at birth ≤33cm to ≤32cm, irrespective of the baby’s sex or gestational age at birth. In a letter to the Lancet in February 2016 a group of Brazilian epidemiologists argued to use the international INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards as these are sex and gestational age specific standards for optimal size at birth. Their use, they stated, could reduce the number of suspected cases in Brazil from an anticipated 600,000 to 63,000 or 3,000 for cut\-offs of \-2SD or \-3SD, respectively \[D\]. 

 WHO published an interim Rapid Advice Guideline in February 2016 and an update in August 2016 \[E\], which included the recommendation to use the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Preterm Postnatal Growth Standards for pre\-term neonates \(and for term neonates if accurate gestational age is known\) to interpret postnatal changes in head circumference until 64 weeks postmenstrual age. The CDC’s ZIKV management guidelines also recommend the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Fetal Growth Standards to assess head circumference at three points during pregnancy \[F\]. The use of a more specific definition of microcephaly focuses screening efforts, reduces the need for further investigations, and would also reduce the burden and costs on the health system. Furthermore, it alleviates the emotional effects on parents of healthy infants who might have otherwise been given a false\-positive result in the screening assessment \[D\]. The Brazilian Government subsequently adopted the standards for all pre\-term babies born in the country. 

####  Reinterpretation of existing newborn data in low\-middle income countries \(LMICs\) 

 In a 2015 JAMA paper, the Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group at Johns Hopkins University concluded that using the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards rather than the US Birth Weight References reduced the prevalence of small for gestational age \(SGA\) in 16 LMIC cohorts without any effect on neonatal mortality \[G\], i.e. using the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards resulted in a decrease in the percentage of neonatal deaths attributable to SGA. In a 2017 *BMJ* paper, the same group selected the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Newborn Size Standards \[4\] as the most reliable tool for estimating the true prevalence of SGA in LMICs worldwide \[H\]. The revised 2012 data, using the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> definition, indicated that 23,300,000 infants were born SGA, with an estimated 606,500 attributable neonatal deaths, i.e. 21.9% of all neonatal deaths worldwide. 

  

####  Healthcare professional uptake and training 

 For implementation purposes, the study team made the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> clinical tools, publications, tables, charts, calculators, apps, and training resources freely downloadable \[Ii\]. Clinicians and health practioners are further supported through a number of training resources \[Iii\]. Between July 2014 and May 2020 the resources have been downloaded from The Global Health Network website 231,726 times by users in 195 countries and territories, and 23,580 healthcare professionals have been trained using INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> e\-learning modules \[J\]. 

 In 2019, The Global Health Network conducted an online survey of website users \(hospitals/health centres 57.0%; universities 19.9%; NGOs 15.1%; Health Ministries/ others 8.0%\). The following percentages of these users had introduced the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> standards into clinical practice in their institutions: pregnancy dating 43.2%; symphyseal\-fundal height 31.6%; fetal growth by ultrasound 40.1%; newborn size 56.4%; gestational weight gain 34.9%, and preterm postnatal growth 50.6%. More than 100 health care professionals have been trained to deliver the INTERGROWTH\-21<sup>st</sup> Neurodevelopment Package \(INTER\-NDA\), which has been used to assess the neurodevelopment of over 15,000 2\-year old children in 14 countries. The operation manuals and protocols for the INTER\-NDA are freely available \[Iiii\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Significant new research and insights into what impacts women’s engagement and experiences of *perinatal physical activity* \(that which takes place before, during, after and between pregnancy\) identifying the need for clear national guidance, consistent pre\-qualification and in\-service training, and improved and collaborative interprofessional communication has led to: 

1.  The first UK Chief Medical Officers’ National Perinatal Physical Activity Guidelines 

1.  New National Medical and Healthcare Pre\-Qualification and In\-Service Training, Interventions and Industry Standards for Perinatal Physical Activity, reaching 160,000 medical students per annum and 1.5 million health professionals, plus 50,000 GP surgeries, in doing so increasing the confidence of health professionals to advise perinatal women, and the physical activity levels of perinatal women. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2012, Dr Hayley Mills and Dr Marlize DeVivo have led research at Canterbury Christ Church University into *perinatal physical activity* \(that which takes place before, during, after and between pregnancy\).  The research has focused on the factors that contribute to low levels of perinatal physical activity, despite the benefits of physical activity across the perinatal period being well evidenced and well established for both mother and child \[R1\].  This work has included the first meta\-analysis of factors that impact physical activity behaviour during pregnancy \[R2\], with this and empirical work focusing on pregnant women \[R2, R3, R4\], health professionals \[R4,R5\], post\-partum women \[R4, R6\] and clinical policy makers \[R1\].  In doing so, it has developed significant new insight into what impacts women’s engagement and experiences of perinatal physical activity. 

 Both the context and the empirical work with women and health professionals \[R2, R3, R4, R5\] reinforced the extant literature in showing that physical activity is low during pregnancy, particularly in the earlier stages of pregnancy which are perceived by women to be higher risk \[R3\], and continues to be low after pregnancy, rarely returning to pre\-pregnancy levels.  Substantively, findings relate to the experiences of perinatal women and the practice of health professionals. 

 Firstly, the research identified a number of real and perceived barriers experienced by pregnant and post\-partum women, as well as those trying to become pregnant for either the first or subsequent times: 

1.  The physical and psychological demands of both pregnancy and post\-natal caring responsibilities are experienced as all\-encompassing, leaving little time to focus on what are often perceived to be less relevant concerns, such as physical activity \[R2, R5\]. 

1.  The perceived risk of physical activity \(especially when described as ‘exercise’\) to the pregnancy \[R2, R3, R4\], particularly in the perceived higher risk early stages \[R3\], and to post\-partum health \[R6\] of both mother \(e.g. pelvic health\) and baby \(e.g. perceived impact on ability to breast\-feed\). 

1.  The psychological pressures to become pregnant are also experienced as all\-encompassing \(therefore crowding\-out physical activity\) for some women \[R5\], as is a perceived risk of physical activity to becoming pregnant \[R3\]. 

1.  A tendency to conform with the views of others, including significant others such as partners, parents, wider family and other women at the same perinatal stage, who often advise against, or frown upon, physical activity \[R2, R3, R4, R5\]. 

1.  Exacerbating 2\-4 above, a lack of clear, consistent, and trusted advice across the perinatal period, from health professionals and in public guidance \[R1, R2, R3\], and a lack of access to resources for perinatal physical activity \[R2\]. 

 Secondly, the research identified issues and barriers for health professionals and clinical policy\-makers in the provision of advice for perinatal physical activity: 

1.  Midwives and related\-health professionals felt vulnerable and lacked confidence to provide physical activity advice, and therefore frequently did not do so, often underpinned by fears of exposure to risk and subsequent litigation and liability \[R5\]. 

1.  Health professionals identified a lack of pre\-qualification and in\-service training as impacting their ability and confidence to provide physical activity advice at all stages of the perinatal journey \[R4, R5\]. 

1.  There is a lack of interprofessional collaboration to link up health professionals and exercise professionals, and to link professionals at each perinatal stage \(i.e., before, during, after and between pregnancies\), resulting in inconsistent messages and advice \[R4, R5\], and a lack of knowledge and resources about how to advise women to access physical activity across the perinatal period \[R5\]. 

1.  Neither national physical activity guidance \[R2, R3\], nor clinical guidance \[R1\], addressed the issue of perinatal physical activity. 

 Consequently, the research identifies the need for and recommends: 

1.  Clear national guidance on physical activity across the perinatal period. 

1.  Development of consistent pre\-qualification and in\-service training for midwives and other health professionals \(including exercise professionals\), as well as clear industry standards for such training. 

1.  Improved and collaborative communication to both health professionals and women at all stages of the perinatal period. 

 Collectively \[R2, R3, R4, R5, R6\] and specifically \[R4,R5\], Mills and DeVivo’s research emphasises a lifecourse approach to supporting perinatal physical activity, and notes that advice during pregnancy is vital and necessary, but not sufficient, for the immediate and long\-term health of both mothers and their children.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **\(I\) THE FIRST UK CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICERS’ NATIONAL PERINATAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES.** 

 The four UK Chief Medical Officer’s \(CMO’s\) previous national guidance on physical activity, issued in 2011, contained no content or advice referring to physical activity in pregnancy, post\-partum, or across the perinatal period.  An initial scientific consensus meeting in 2018 to initiate a review of national physical activity guidance, convened at the request of the four UK CMOs and attended by Mills, considered Mills and DeVivo’s research and recommendations on both the need for consistent, trusted guidance across the perinatal period, and the lack of confidence among health professionals in supporting perinatal physical activity behaviours.  The Chair noted *“it was clear Dr Mills expertise regarding issues surrounding perinatal physical activity guidance, knowledge and training would provide a valuable contribution to our new guidelines”* \[S1\]. 

 At this meeting *“findings by Mills and DeVivo regarding health professionals’ lack of confidence and knowledge in supporting physical activity behaviour, alongside additional insights into the need for consistent, trusted guidance, was persuasive”.*  As a direct consequence, the four UK CMO’s commissioned the first national guidelines for physical activity to span the perinatal period, both before and after childbirth \[S1\]. 

 Mills was invited to Chair the Expert Group to develop the guidelines for post\-partum physical activity, which also included DeVivo as a member \[S1, S2\]. 

 The recommendations of Mills’ Group were subsequently adopted by the four UK CMOs and included for the first time in the UK CMO’s Physical Activity Guidelines, published in September 2019 \[S2\].  The Chair noted, *“findings by Mills and DeVivo, and their support from the start, was fundamental in this decision to include new guidelines”* \[S1\]. 

 Mills’ Group also developed communication materials to be circulated and disseminated with the UK Guidance to inform and support both health professionals and post\-partum women in relation to perinatal physical activity \[S3\]. 

 Following the publication of the UK Guidance, Mills was invited to join the CMO’s Physical Activity Communications Committee, to which DeVivo also served as a Specialist Advisor \[S1\], which continues to provide evidence\-based advice to the four UK CMO’s on the effective communication and implementation of the UK Guidance. 

 In 2020, Mills and DeVivo worked with physiotherapy colleagues and Sports Medicine Northern Ireland to align previous recommendations for returning to running after childbirth with the UK CMO’s perinatal physical activity guidance \[R6\].  These new recommendations, endorsed by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports and Exercise Medicine \[S5\], expanded the reach of Mills’ and DeVivo’s research and recommendations beyond guidance for immediate post\-partum moderate physical activity into recommendations for post\- or inter\-pregnancy vigorous activity which further supported the full perinatal period and lifecourse approach. 

 **\(II\) NATIONAL MEDICAL AND HEALTHCARE PRE\-QUALIFICATION AND IN\-SERVICE TRAINING AND INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR PERINATAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY** 

 Research and recommendations by Mills and DeVivo have led directly to the development of new pre\-qualification and in\-service training for doctors, midwives and other health professionals \(including exercise professionals\) regarding perinatal physical activity, as well as industry standards. The training and standards have been endorsed, accredited, adopted and delivered by national government agencies and professional, statutory and regulatory bodies \(PSRBs\). 

 The research and recommendations have informed and supported both the initial development of healthcare training and interventions, and the subsequent alignment of training with the UK CMO’s Physical Activity Guidelines for perinatal women, developed by Dr Mills’ Expert Group \[S2,S3\] and commissioned as a result of Mills’ and DeVivo’s research \[S1\]. It is the first time that national training and interventions, and industry standards, have been developed to include clear and consistent messages and materials, aligned to UK CMO Guidance, to support consistency and advice for perinatal physical activity at all stages of the perinatal period: 

-  **Pre\-qualification Training**: *Movement For Movement,* the physical activity curriculum resource endorsed and distributed by the UK Council of Deans of Health for use in UK Medical Schools and Faculties of Health has been updated to include perinatal physical activity content developed by Mills and DeVivo, and informed by their research, to align with the UK CMO Guidance \[S5\]. Its reach is approximately 160,000 UK healthcare students per annum \[S6\(i\)\], and in 2020 it was funded to be extended to Medical Schools in five EU countries – Lithuania, France, Portugal, Greece and Estonia \[S6\(ii\)\]. 

-  **In\-service Training and Toolkits:** Based on their research, Mills and DeVivo were invited to update a wide\-range of national in\-service training and toolkits for health professionals in the UK and home nations to include training on perinatal physical activity aligned with UK CMO Guidance. A Royal College of General Practitioners \(RCGP\) Clinical Priority Steering Group member, and Medical Advisor to Public Health Wales, notes: *“The involvement of the considerable expertise of Dr Mills and Dr De Vivo in the development of these resources, has been crucial in ensuring that the research evidence is accurate, up to date and relevant to pregnant woman. This is critical when these resources are used in educating our medical workforce with the benefits of physical activity in pregnancy”* \[S7\]. The resources \[S8\] include: 

-  <ins> *e\-Learning for Healthcare*</ins> \(for Public Health England & Health Education England, endorsed by The Active Pregnancy Foundation and the Chartered Institute for the Management of Sport and Physical Activity \(CIMSPA\)\), reaching over 1.5million healthcare professionals as registered users. 

-  <ins> *M</ins><ins>otivate2Move*</ins> \(for Health Education and Improvement Wales, endorsed by the Royal College of Nursing\), accessed by over 100,000 health professionals annually. 

-  <ins> *R</ins><ins>CG</ins><ins>P Active Practice Charter and*</ins> <ins> *Physical Activity and Lifestyle Toolkit*</ins>, provided to 50,000 UK Doctors in general practice to support the provision of lifestyle advice to their patients. 

-  <ins> *Moving Medicine*</ins> \(for Public Health England and Public Health Scotland, endorsed by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges\) a resource of online courses, toolkits and consultation guides for UK healthcare professionals, launched by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, who said *“I am delighted to launch this brilliant web tool for healthcare professionals – I hope it will help pave the way for a culture shift in medicine”*. 

-  **National Intervention:** *This Mum Moves, ukactive*’s national resource for healthcare professionals and perinatal women, funded by Sport England, developed with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, accredited by the Institute of Health Visiting \(iHV\) and endorsed by the RCGPs and Royal College of Midwives \[S9\(i\)\], was written and developed by DeVivo based on Mills and DeVivo’s research \[S9\(ii\)\].  *ukactive* note *“combatting underrepresentation is a key part of our mission – women, and pregnant women in particular, are an underrepresented group in terms of physical activity… this knowledge and research experience has been foundational in educating and equipping healthcare professionals with the relevant information in order to discuss being physically active throughout this time in a woman’s life”* \[S9\(ii\)\].  The iHV note, “ *…without this expertise and research we would not have had the insight into the needs of these women to support the development of rich and accessible resources”* \[S9\(iii\)\].  An initial evaluation of the intervention found more than two\-thirds of health professionals felt more confident to offer advice after training, with one saying *“I’m so glad to have training on this as I don’t think I ever had before. I know it’s so important but I lack confidence on how best to advise women… I am looking forward now to being able to give the correct advice”* \[S9\(iv\)\]. In addition, 60% of women taking part in the intervention increased physical activity mid pregnancy AND post\-partum, with one saying *“Building good habits during pregnancy has helped me to continue good habits in my recovery after birth”* \[S9\(iv\)\]. 

 **Industry Standards:** <ins>Health Matters: Physical Activity</ins> **,** Public Health England’s guidance for healthcare professionals, local authorities and NHS organisations, has adopted and included the UK CMO’s Physical Activity Guidelines for perinatal women, developed by Mills’ Expert Group \[S10\(i\)\]; <ins> *CIMSPA Professional Standards*</ins>, now include a standard for Working with Antenatal and Postnatal Clients \[S19\] which aligns with the UK CMO Guidelines, and for which DeVivo served on the Development Committee \[S10\(ii\)\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) has led to new ways of creating contemporary church music. Harris has commissioned composers, created a new record label, and has recorded CDs featuring the Choir of St. Giles’ Cathedral, Edinburgh. This has led to novel contributions from British composers to the field of church music.The research has had a beneficial reputational and commercial influence on St Giles’ Cathedral, receiving acknowledgment of its influence on the atmosphere for the cathedral’s 1.4million estimated annual visitors. The choir has also performed the created music on international tours, and the record label has sold almost 1,500 CD copies.The work has also informed the practices of composers and influenced national and international concert audiences via the BBC. Commissioned work was performed on BBC Radio 3, and CD releases, including *O Clap Your Hands,* have provided an international platform for composers to redefine church music. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the exception of very few contemporary works, much of the music used in worship by churches in the UK was written between the 16<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. This has often led to a reductive view of church music by both congregations and the wider public. As a result, churches and performers have often struggled for relevance and exposure in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. In an attempt to reverse this trend, the underpinning research has focused on improving the breadth and diversity of contemporary church music. 

 Michael Harris is a Lecturer at ENU and Master of the Music at St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, one of the largest and most renowned churches in Scotland. He has led this research body with contributions from fellow lecturer and composer Stewart Murray Mitchell. 

 Harris has developed a self\-termed “Edinburgh model” **\[O1,O2\]** for the reinvigoration of church music, based on his work with St Giles Cathedral. He has provided composers with opportunities to work in the domain of church music, requiring compositions to consider worshipping congregations and their attitudes towards ‘new’ music. The purpose of sacred music in this context is to enhance the act of worship, effecting a change of emotion in the listener and contributing to their religious or spiritual experience. This ‘new’ music also engages with a new generation of churchgoers, who may have previously considered church music to be outmoded or prosaic. 

 In 2014, Harris commissioned two Edinburgh\-based composers, Stuart Murray Mitchell, who became a PhD student and lecturer at ENU a year later, and Chris Hutchings, to compose two new works for the Cathedral Choir with funding from The Friends of the Music of St Giles’ Cathedral **\[P1\]**. The resultant works, *Five Introits* and *O Praise the Lord Ye Angels of His,* fulfilled two purposes; to create a group of introits that could be used throughout the liturgical year, and an anthem to enhance the experience of the worshipping congregation **\[O2\]**. 

 Following these successful compositions, Harris programmed a similar series of works by renowned living composers in both a liturgical and in a concert setting. The result has been a series of recordings created by high\-profile composers and performed by the Cathedral Choir **\[O3, O4\]**. 

 As a result of this initial research, Harris secured subsequent funding from The Friends of the Music of St Giles’ Cathedral to commission a number of new works from internationally renowned musicians. Rory Boyle’s *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2, O4\]** *,* Ann Millikan’s *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]** *,* and Jonathan Pitkin’s *As Kingfishers Catch Fire* **\[P4, O6\]** are further new compositions which have been recorded for worship and used for concerts at St Giles’, performed by the Cathedral Choir and the organist at that time, Peter Backhouse.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2014 this research has benefitted composers, St Giles’ Cathedral, and the St Giles’ Cathedral choir, and has reached national and international audiences. It has: \(i\) developed stimuli to cultural tourism and contributed to the quality of the tourist experience at St Giles, which attracts around 1.4million visitors per year; \(ii\) enhanced the reputation and commercial income of St Giles; and \(iii\) enhanced the quality of life for composers, performers, and audiences of church music. 

 **Growing International Audiences and Increasing Tourist Visitors to St. Giles’ Cathedral** 

 Harris’ programming of new works has led to a number of novel concerts and recitals by the Cathedral Choir and their organist **\[O1\-O6\]**.  This has enhanced the reputation of the Cathedral as a forward\-thinking institution that highly values its contribution to both worship and culture. The choir performed the commissioned work in tours in Germany in 2015 and the United States in 2017, thus enhancing their international profile. Information on the tours is provided below:

 Furthermore, these new works have been used regularly in services of worship to a congregation comprising a diverse cross\-section of the public. These include those who do not regularly attend concerts featuring contemporary music, in addition to the large number of tourists who attend services at St Giles’ Cathedral due to its central location in Edinburgh’s Old Town. In her letter detailing the number of visitors to the Cathedral, Sarah Phemister, Head of Heritage and Culture at St. Giles’, outlines how ‘ *Michael’s work on our music programme has a tremendous impact…The popularity of our music programme, and the strong reputation it has developed under Michael’s stewardship, ensures that we often attract large crowds to these events*’ and that ‘ *no less significant, is the role of the music programme in fostering a welcoming atmosphere in St. Giles’’* **\[C6\]**. 

 **Launch of the Aegidius Record Label and Commercial and Reputational Benefit to St. Giles Cathedral** 

 In 2014, as a result of his research, Harris was responsible for creating the Cathedral’s new record label, Aegidius, with the launch of its first two compact discs; *O Clap Your Hands* and *On Christmas Night*. This was featured in the pages of *The Herald* newspaper \(estimated weekly readership 91,000, 2014\) **\[C4\]** and the first CD received a four\-star review in *Choir and Organ* magazine. The review by Shirley Ratcliffe stated: ‘ *St. Giles’s excellent Cathedral Choir directed by Michael Harris is in fine voice for a programme of sacred music written between 1914 and 2014’* **\[C3\]** and makes specific reference to the commissioning of new works by Stuart Murray Mitchell and Chris Hutchings. 

 The raison d'être of both discs **\[O3, O4\]** was to further the reputation of the Cathedral Choir and to solidify its commitment to enhancing the reputation of Scottish church music. As a result of the collaboration, St Giles’ Cathedral is one of only four cathedrals in Scotland who have commercially available recordings. As the first of these discs, *O Clap Your Hands* **\[O3\]**, comprises only works written between 1914\-2014, it provides a valuable snapshot of British liturgical choral music over the past century, and celebrates the diversity of church music which is still very much apparent today. 

 The second disc, *On Christmas Night*, similarly features a number of works from living composers, namely Cecilia McDowall, Gabriel Jackson, and Matthew Owens in addition to early\-career composer, Andrew Carvel. Along with a third release, *The Auld Alliance: Organ Music from Scotland and France*, and a fourth release, *Laudate Dominum: Sing Praises to God\!* **\[O4\]**, which features Boyle’s *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P4\]**, the label has sold nearly 1,500 copies of its releases to date **\[C2\]**. In a letter from David W. S. Todd, President of the The Friends of the Music of St. Giles’ Cathedral, he outlines how profits from the sales of Aegidius releases have been used to fund new recordings and commission more new works for choir and organ over the next five years. Todd states how *‘these commissions will be important and significant additions to the repertoire for Cathedral/Church choirs and, because, the funds from the Friends are self\-generating they can also be recorded and these will add greatly to the value of the commissions. The Friends commend this model of funding, commissioning, performing and recording new works*.’ **\[C7\]**. 

 **Influence on Composers and Their Contribution to the Musical Canon** 

 Through the commissioning process Harris has facilitated an expansion of contemporary church music repertoire. This includes three works suitable as anthems \( *O Praise the Lord Ye Angels of His, O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2\]** *, As Kingfishers Catch Fire* **\[P4, O6\]**\), a collection of introits \( *Five Introits* **\[O2\]**\), and an organ voluntary \( *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]**\), all of which demonstrate the vibrancy of contemporary church music. Furthermore, a number of works, particularly *Five Introits* **\[O2\]** and *O Sacrum Convivium* **\[P2\]** *,* were composed with the amateur musician in mind, allowing them to be subsumed into numerous church repertoires from cathedrals to smaller institutions.As a composer, Mitchell explains how Harris’s ‘ *championing of new music has had a profound effect on my own work. The subsequent recording of two of the introits afforded me with evidence of my output, in turn, aiding its dissemination to a wider audience through sales of the CD around the UK and abroad. Furthermore, these recordings have provided me with a vital artefact which attests to my experience in writing for choir, bolstering prospective opportunities for commissioning by other organisations and individuals’* **\[C8\]**. 

 Whilst the majority of new commissions utilise choral forces with or without accompaniment and feature a sacred text, *Preston Toccata* **\[P3, O5\]** is a solo organ work based on two traditional bagpipe tunes, celebrating the union between Scotland and France. The world premiere was performed by Harris and broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 16 June 2017 **\[C5\]**. While the BBC are unable to share audience figures for individual programmes, its weekly reach for that quarter was 2.046m **\[C9\].** Millikan writes how *‘\[t\]he impact of Preston Toccata on my career has been a great deal of international exposure, particularly in the UK, which is ongoing. The score for Preston Toccata has been purchased by organists in England and in the United States, including a PhD student who plans to record the work as part of a project supported by Theodore Presser. Michael Harris’ commitment to new music is making a difference in the lives of musicians, composers, and audiences, internationally. His stunning performance of Preston Toccata is something I will never forget’* **\[C9\]**. 

 Due to the favourable reception of his work thus far, Harris has commissioned a further group of composers to write works for the Cathedral Choir, which will subsequently be recorded and performed in various recitals and concerts throughout the world. This five\-year project is funded by the Friends of the Music of St Giles’ and Creative Scotland and involves the internationally recognised composers James Macmillan, Savourna Stevenson, Ken Dempster, Tom Harrold, and Helen Grime.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Musculoskeletal conditions are the leading contributor to disability worldwide. Research at the University of Southampton has pioneered ultrasound imaging \( **USI**\) for novel applications of musculoskeletal assessment in two allied health disciplines: 

 Application in the first discipline, Podiatry, has changed care pathways in practice, exemplified by a local foot and ankle diagnostic USI \(DUSI\) clinic shaped by our research, which since 2016 has reduced the length of care pathway from 42 to 9 weeks, and clinical visits from 6 to 2. Foot and ankle DUSI is included as a separate section in UK guidelines, and its increased uptake by podiatrists across the world is evident in Europe \(6 countries\), Canada, Australia, South Africa, Kenya and USA. 

 Application in the second discipline, Physiotherapy, has extended the scope of practice in managing challenging conditions, such as back pain, and driven clinical uptake in the UK, with even wider adoption internationally in 50 countries, notably in Europe \(12 countries\), Australia and USA. Physiotherapy USI research has been translated into three main clinical applications: 1\) diagnostic; 2\) rehabilitative \(assessment and biofeedback\); 3\) interventional \(e.g. guided needles\). Novel translation has led to routine monitoring of muscle health in astronauts pre and postflight. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A Global Burden of Disease study revealed that musculoskeletal conditions are the highest contributor to global disability \(16% of all years lived with disability\), and low back pain is the leading cause of disability \(James et al 2018; *Lancet* 392:1789\-858\). Ultrasound imaging \(USI\) offers a safe, accessible, relatively inexpensive alternative to magnetic resonance imaging \(MRI\) for diagnosis of pathology/dysfunction. The portability of USI also permits monitoring of effects of musculoskeletal rehabilitation by allied health professionals \(AHP\). This has extended AHP practice to a scope previously exclusive to Medicine and has supported the health policy agenda \(Department of Health 2008; Framing the Contribution of Allied Health Professionals: London\). 

 Southampton’s research uses USI for two forms of assessment: 1\) diagnosis of foot and ankle musculoskeletal pathology \(led by *Bowen*\); 2\) evaluation of skeletal muscle in terms of size \(morphometry\), architecture \(morphology\) and ability to contract \(led by *Stokes*\). Southampton’s research has directly influenced worldwide adoption of USI into AHP clinical practice, education and research. 

 **Embedding Diagnostic Ultrasound Imaging in Podiatry \(DUSI\):** Prof Catherine Bowen’s research \(2003\-2007\) was the first to identify DUSI as an additional skill that could be used reliably by podiatrists, particularly those working in musculoskeletal health \[ **3.1**\]. The subsequent programme of work \(2010\-2017\), the ‘FeeTURA study’ led by Bowen, involving collaboration with radiologists, rheumatologists and podiatrists from University Hospital Southampton, University of Southampton and University of Oxford, increased understanding of foot problems in rheumatic diseases. Findings indicated that foot DUSI was more beneficial than clinical examination alone, for diagnosis and implementation of effective care pathways for patients with foot symptoms and those starting biologic therapies. Further research produced diagnostic protocols for investigation of forefoot musculoskeletal pathology and validation of DUSI against MRI \[ **3.2**\]. 

 Bowen \(Chair\) established the *Osteoarthritis Research Society International \(OARSI\) Foot and Ankle Research Group* with Dr Lucy Gates in 2018. The Group is supported by the Centre for Sport, Exercise and Osteoarthritis Research Versus Arthritis and brings together a network of clinicians, scientists and other health professionals and key stakeholders across the world. In 2015 Bowen was awarded an NIHR Advanced Fellowship \[ **G1**\] and funding from the Dr W.M.Scholl Podiatric R&D fund \[ **G2**\] that enabled wider translation of the DUSI imaging protocols to produce **clinically useful definitions** of foot and ankle osteoarthritis \[ **3.3**\]. 

 **Providing an evidence base for Ultrasound Imaging in Physiotherapy \(USI\):** Identifying and retraining muscle is difficult if it is too deep to see or feel. Building on her fundamental pre\-2000 research, which established USI as a powerful tool for visualising and estimating a muscle’s strength from its size, Professor Maria Stokes \(with Young\) led the development at the University of Southampton of robust protocols for accurate assessment of specific muscles. Together with Dr Martin Warner, Dr Peter Worsley and doctoral researchers Jackie Whittaker and Sandra Agyapong\-Badu, Stokes has studied technical aspects, reliability of repeated measurements and validity against the gold standard of MRI \[e.g. **3.4**\] and established normal reference ranges in cohorts, such as in different age groups and in the US Army. Southampton’s use of USI as a research tool for investigating neuromuscular physiological mechanisms of dysfunction and recovery underpins clinical use for management of various conditions including back pain, ageing, disuse, injury and postnatal muscle dysfunction \(e.g. back pain and stress incontinence\) \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Novel applications resulting from this research include monitoring muscle size of astronauts in space and aiding their reconditioning after returning to Earth, with implications for inactive patients. In ground\-breaking research by Stokes and Warner \[ **G3,** results embargoed\], the Southampton team train astronauts at the European Space Agency \(ESA\) and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration \(NASA\) to image each other’s muscles while in space. Astronauts are measured preflight and then guided to take images inflight via direct video\-link and a remote motorised ultrasound probe. Monitoring of astronauts’ muscles during 6\-months on the International Space Station increases knowledge of the effects of inactivity on specific muscles, which vary between individuals. Selective loss of muscle informs exercise programmes to help prevent problems such as back pain. 

 An international survey of use of USI by physiotherapists demonstrated how the field has evolved into several specialties from Southampton’s pre\-rehabilitative USI research \[ **3.6**\]. The Physiotherapy survey has been replicated and modified for Podiatry, showing global uptake of DUSI by podiatrists as a key additional skill that benefits patients \[ **5.1**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Embedding Diagnostic Ultrasound Imaging \(DUSI\) in Podiatry – **Bowen, Cherry, Gates** 

 Since Bowen \(2008\) first highlighted that podiatrists could use DUSI reliably, the technique has been widely adopted by those working within the fields of foot and ankle musculoskeletal medicine. International interdisciplinary research with New Zealand collaborators has documented that the use of DUSI by podiatrists has been expanding globally over 2012 – 2020 \[ **5.1, 5.2**\]. Of 239 podiatrists who completed the survey and were regular users of DUSI, the majority were in Europe \(UK 37%, Spain 31%, Netherlands 12%; Malta 1%; Italy 1%; Ireland 0.5%\) with others from Canada \(13%\), Australia \(4%\), South Africa \(0.5%\), USA \(0.5%\) and Kenya \(0.5%\) \[ **5.1**\]. The common cited benefit of using DUSI was *“improved access, reduced waiting times for appointments, and improved patient journeys through tighter, focussed management plans”* \[ **5.1**\]. 

 An exemplar of impact on patient care pathways is a new local Podiatry\-led DUSI clinic within Solent NHS Trust primary care service \(2016\-present\). Directly shaped by the Southampton DUSI research alongside provision of practical, face\-to\-face DUSI training of podiatrists \(n=6\), this has reduced the length of care pathway from 42 to 9 weeks, and clinician encounters from 6 to 2 \[ **5.3**\]. 

 As a direct result of the Southampton team’s research, foot and ankle DUSI is included as a key component in national guidelines \(UK North West Clinical Effectiveness Group and UK Podiatry Rheumatic Care Association, 2011; 2014; 2021 *in prep*\) aimed at the management of foot health in rheumatoid arthritis and improving prognosis through early detection \[ **5.4**\]. The guidelines continue to guide practice of the UK College of Podiatry \(CoP\)’s 13,000 members UK wide \(NHS and independent practice\) with around 350 Podiatry graduates annually. The lead author of the guidelines states, *“the guidelines are a major document used in the undergraduate and postgraduate education of podiatrists and hence enhancing the patient experience and outcome of foot health management”* \[ **5.4**\]. Similarly, in 2017, the team led the ratification of the CoP in becoming one of six member organisations of the Consortium for the Accreditation of Sonographic Education \(CASE\) – a key award ensuring the legitimisation through accreditation of training programmes that develop podiatrists as safe and competent DUSI practitioners. Bowen, as Chair of the CoP Research and Development Committee, founded the CoP Special Advisory Group for DUSI with clinical researchers Dr Lindsey Cherry and Dr Charlotte Dando. 

 Southampton’s research team continue to drive national and international initiatives to ensure the research directly informs podiatric training \(pre and post\-registration\) and clinical practice. For example, the introduction of DUSI workshops in Malta *“has translated into circa N=70 graduate podiatrists over 10 years increasing their understanding of the use and relevance of DUSI towards improvements in the diagnosis and timely management of foot and ankle musculoskeletal problems in Malta”* \[ **5.5**\]. In addition, Bowen gave invited keynote presentations in Singapore and Australia \[ **5.6**\], as well as the UK, and became adjunct professor for Auckland University of Technology \(AUT\), NZ and Queensland University of Technology to support their DUSI research capacity building. Regarding the *Osteoarthritis Research Society International \(OARSI\) Foot and Ankle Research Group* led by Bowen, AUT New Zealand Professor Keith Rome stated: *“the recently formed OARSI foot and ankle research group will allow future collaboration between the two institutes relating to DUSI and in other inflammatory arthropathies such as systemic lupus erythematous and psoriatic arthritis”* \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **Driving Ultrasound Imaging in Physiotherapy – **Stokes, Warner, Worsley** 

 Findings from University of Southampton research have led to the **translation and global take\-up of USI techniques in Physiotherapy** into other areas, such as diagnostics, guiding rehabilitative and interventional techniques \(e.g. guided acupuncture and injections\). The work with Space Agencies \(ESA, NASA \[ **G3**\]\), in particular, has raised the profile of USI in Physiotherapy. 

 The global reach of Southampton’s research impact is best evidenced through Stokes’ leading position in an **international consortium** of USI Physiotherapy experts \[letters of support **5.7**\- **5.9**\], who established the field of **Rehabilitative USI \(RUSI\)** at the first RUSI Symposium in 2006 \(Texas, USA\) and whose most recent undertaking was the 2020 **international USI survey of physiotherapists** \[ **3.6**\]. The 2006 symposium was led by US Army Medical Specialist Colonel Deydre S. Teyhen, who stated in 2020: *“In regards to \[RUSI\], it is clear from the research literature that Dr Stokes’ team initiated this field of study for physical therapists. The investigative team in Southampton has conducted basic research required to validate this technology and been international thought leaders on how to apply this technology”* \[ **5.7**\]. The lead author of the 2020 international USI survey, Dr Richard Ellis of AUT, cited \[ **3.5**\] as “ *one of the seminal publications for physiotherapy USI*”, adding that “th *e different applications of USI in Physiotherapy have stemmed from the Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging \[RUSI\] field, which was greatly influenced by research from Southampton.”* \[ **5.8**\] 

 The international USI survey attracted more than 1,300 responses, which indicated a wide scope of practice \(in terms of different applications\) of USI across the Physiotherapy profession in **50 countries**. Applications include diagnosis of musculoskeletal pathology, monitoring healing after muscle trauma, biofeedback to re\-educate muscle contraction and guiding needles, e.g. for acupuncture. These uses of USI result in more accurate assessment and more tailored treatment for individual patients, making treatment more effective. The survey illustrated the wide global reach of our research impact, with 60% of respondents being users in Europe, 20% in Australasia and 10% in North America. Within Europe, 47% of UK respondents were users, with higher proportions in the Netherlands \(82%\) and Spain \(69%; where USI is already implemented in pre\-registration Physiotherapy training\). In Australia, 69% were USI users. 

 Teyhen further testified to the international reach of Southampton’s research impact, stating that “ *in addition to \[the UK\], Southampton’s work helped advance RUSI for musculoskeletal medicine in the United States, Australia, and other European Countries. Their work in this field advanced physical therapy both in the civilian and military sectors… It is important to note that the gold standard techniques that previously existed were not translatable into a clinical setting. This is why this line of research has had such a huge impact around the world*.” 

 Stokes has driven this adoption through several strands of activity within the REF impact period. She chaired the closing discussion at the second RUSI Symposium in 2016 \(Madrid, Spain\) to set international clinical, education and research agendas. This led the consortium to author a 2019 **International Position Statement** \[ **5.10**\], which highlights the impact of USI use in clinical practice: “ *faced with the rapid growth of USI use by physical therapists over the last decade, the profession is faced with a situation in which its traditional scope is being challenged to evolve*”. The hosts of the Symposium from Acalá University, Madrid stated \[ **5.9**\]: “ *a new paradigm shift was reached, thanks to the international consensus”.* Ellis asserts that this Position Statement *“is evidence of Southampton’s impact that is leading regulation and policy development for physiotherapy USI …”* \[ **5.8**\]. The position statement shows how USI protocols developed by the Southampton team are used to monitor changes in muscles due to pathology, disuse and recovery. It also illustrates eloquently how physiotherapists’ use of USI has evolved from Southampton’s research to **three distinct clinical applications**: 1\) diagnostic; 2\) rehabilitative \(RUSI; assessment and biofeedback tool to aid recovery\); and 3\) interventional \(e.g. guided acupuncture needles and injections\) \[ **5.10**\]. 

 These advances have translated directly to novel applications that have changed practice, and in 2018 Stokes and Warner were funded by the UK Space Agency on an international collaborative ESA\-funded project \(Muscle Tone in Space; Myotones Project\) to monitor ESA and NASA astronauts’ muscles during 6\-months on the International Space Station \(ISS\), at a full economic cost of £50m. The head physiotherapist at ESA says: *“I use USl to assess muscle size and contraction in astronauts after a long\-term stay in microgravity”* to aid their recovery \[ **5.11**\]. This work with deconditioned astronauts also provides insight into mitigating the deconditioning effects of aging on muscles, as well as rehabilitation after periods of inactivity. Embedding USI protocols for testing muscles aided validation of *Myoton* muscle measurement technology \(MyotonPRO, a non\-invasive hand\-held device that measures tone of superficial muscles\) and thus enabled its early adoption on the ISS. **Science Minister** Sam Gyimah said: "" *This pioneering space project … a great example of how we are backing science and the space sector through our modern Industrial Strategy and how, through our Ageing Society Grand Challenge, we are harnessing the power of innovation to help meet the needs of an ageing society.""* \[ **5.12**\]. Dr Libby Jackson of the **UK Space Agency \(UKSA\)** said the UKSA *“supports ground breaking experiments, like this one at the University of Southampton, to monitor the muscle health of astronauts … as part of our commitment to ensure Britain is a leader in space\-based scientific research and innovation.”* \[ **5.12**\]. In July 2018 an **astronaut** \(>1.3 million followers\) tweeted and stressed in a video the **importance of monitoring** musculoskeletal health in space \[ **5.13**\]. 

 The **Covid\-19 pandemic** required the Southampton scientists to teach and guide NASA USI specialists \(novices to muscle imaging\) remotely to image muscles, providing lessons for virtual guided imaging on Earth between specialist medical centres and remote clinics \[ **5.14**\]. The Southampton course for physiotherapists was the first to be endorsed by a medical imaging body \(British Medical Ultrasound Society, 2004\). Teyhen states: *“Southampton’s evidence\-based educational courses on this topic helped ensure the highest level of science, quality, and safety were integrated into the clinical application...”*  \[ **5.7**\] *.* Other courses informed by Southampton’s research have evolved, several by University of Southampton alumni, course attendees and research collaborators worldwide, including the UK \(John Leddy\), Canada \(Jackie Whittaker\), Australia \(Julie Hides\) Ireland, \(Cliona O’Sullivan\) and Spain \(Samuel Fernández\-Carnero\). In Spain, the number of courses delivered across Universities and Hospitals in 2020 “ *has reached 3\-4 courses each weekend… recognition came from the Community of Madrid Sanitary Counsel, which approved the education and purchase of ultrasound units for Physiotherapists in Public Health Hospitals* \[ **5.9**\] *”*. 

 The contribution of Southampton’s extensive impact on the uptake of USI was reflected in Stokes’ award of an OBE in 2018 for ‘ *Services to Physiotherapy Research’.*

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study demonstrates the links between Neil Messer’s expertise in theological bioethics and his contribution to the policy and practice of the European Protestant churches on ethical questions. This is focused through the Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe \(CPCE\). In 2013 Messer was appointed to the CPCE’s Expert Group on Ethics because of his reputation in theology and bioethics. He edited and co\-authored a Guide to the Ethics of Reproductive Medicine, the Expert Group’s main task from 2013\-18. This has been the subject of a colloquium at the European Parliament, influenced CPCE’s further work on ethical questions, been used as an educational resource in member churches, and informed their policy and practice.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

###  Neil Messer has an international reputation in theological ethics and bioethics, reflected in numerous publications. Examples particularly relevant to this case study, produced during his time at the University of Winchester, are listed in section 3 below. Messer’s research programme in bioethics and related areas is to develop a distinctively Protestant theological approach to bioethics, drawing on theologians such as Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer \(3.4 ch. 1; 3.3 ch. 4; 3.1 ch. 3\). Often this requires a theological reframing of bioethical issues and debates \(3.4 ch. 1\). Messer’s theological approach to bioethical debases so reframed is expressed, for example, in the “diagnostic questions,” which he has developed and refined over a number of years, for evaluating technological projects and practices theologically and ethically \(3.4 pp. 32\-43; 3.1 pp. 162\-5\). This theological approach to bioethics has been worked out in numerous publications on a wide range of bioethical issues, including human genetics, embryology and cloning \(3.4 chs 3, 4\), reproductive medicine \(3.2\), the ethics of biomedical research involving human participants, human embryos and non\-human animals \(3.4 chs 4\-6\), healthcare resource allocation \(3.4 ch. 7\), the care of patients with disorders of consciousness \(3.1 ch. 5\), and assisted dying \(3.4 ch. 8\). Messer has also explored the relationship between this kind of theological bioethics and public ethical and policy debates on bioethical questions \(3.4 ch. 2; 3.5\). The latter topic was also the subject of an AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award \(2011\-14\) for which he was PI and lead supervisor. 

###  On the strength of his research profile and reputation in theological bioethics, Messer was appointed in 2013 to the Expert Group on Ethics of the Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe \(CPCE\), described more fully in section 4 below. The Expert Group’s main task during the period of this case study was the production of a major Guide to the Ethics of Reproductive Medicine, which Messer edited and co\-authored. His theological approach to bioethics, outlined above, informed his contribution to the design and shaping of the Guide as a whole, and particular sections were directly informed by various specific aspects of his research. These included: 

-  His work on the relationship between Christian theological bioethics and public bioethical debate \( **3.4** ch. 2; 3.5\). 

-  His work on human embryo research, cloning and human\-animal hybrid embryos \(human admixed embryos; **3.4** chs 3, 4\) 

-  His work on the analytical use and limitations of the concept of “personhood” in bioethics \( **3.4** pp. 19\-43; **3.1** pp. 128\-42\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Context: The Communion of Protestant Churches in Europe 

###  The Communion \(formerly ‘Community’\) of Protestant Churches in Europe \(CPCE, or in German GEKE\) is an ecumenical body of 94 Lutheran, Methodist, Reformed and United Church denominations in over 30 countries, representing around 50 million Protestant Christians. The European Baptist Federation also has links with CPCE. 

###  Initial impact: production of a CPCE Guide to the Ethics of Reproductive Medicine. 

###  In 2013 the CPCE Council mandated its Expert Group on Ethics to produce a guide to the ethics of reproductive medicine for member churches. Messer was appointed to the Expert Group on the strength of his international research reputation in bioethics. He became the lead author and editor of this document, entitled ‘Before I Formed You in the Womb…’: A Guide to the Ethics of Reproductive Medicine from the Council of the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe \(5.1; hereafter the Guide\). 

###  As editor and lead author, Messer drafted some sections himself, played a major role in discussions and revisions of other group members’ drafts, and edited the document into a coherent whole. His theological approach to bioethics, described above in sections 2 and 3, informed the overall design and shaping of the Guide. A distinctive feature is its so\-called ‘Protestant corridor’ approach to recognising both common ground and diversity in Protestant ethical reflection on these questions. Messer has been described as the ‘key architect’ of this approach \(5.10\). Specific parts of the Guide are particularly informed by Messer’s research and publications, including: 

-  Chapter 3, section 3.3.1 on natural law; 

-  Chapter 3, section 3.5 on the moral status of the human embryo; 

-  Chapter 3, section 3.7 on the Church and the public realm; 

-  Chapter 9, on research and novel therapies; 

-  Chapter 10, on reproductive cloning and artificial gametes. 

###  The drafting process included consultation with member churches, ecumenical partners, legal and medical experts and representatives of European political institutions. Already at this stage, those involved testified to the value of the draft Guide for the churches and wider public debate. For example, a medical doctor and academic from the Netherlands described it as ‘a very valuable document … which will support Christians of the Protestant Churches in Europe with ethical decision\-making’ \(512, p. 9\). 

###  Following its adoption by the CPCE Council, the Guide was published in June 2017. It has been disseminated online \( [http://cpce\-repro\-ethics.eu/](http://cpce-repro-ethics.eu/)\) and a copy sent to every CPCE member church. By December 2020, 5,340 copies had been downloaded from the website \(Source 9\), one of the highest download figures for any CPCE publication. 

###  Further impact of the Guide 

###  Even in the relatively short time since its publication, the Guide has had further impacts on the CPCE’s public and ecumenical networks, the CPCE’s own work and member churches. 

###  \(i\) Public and ecumenical impact 

###  A colloquium on the Guide was held at the European Parliament in Brussels on 2 May 2018. The 30 participants included representatives of the European Commission, European Parliament, the State of North Rhine\-Westphalia and Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox church organizations. One participant, representative of the \(Orthodox\) Church of Greece to the EU, described the Guide as ‘an important contribution to the dialogue that is currently unfolded between the Christian Churches in a crucial subject for the future of the human being,’ with an ‘exemplary’ approach to church ethical deliberation. \(Source 3\). 

###  \(ii\) Impact on CPCE 

###  At the CPCE General Assembly in September 2018, the CPCE Vice\-President commended the Guide’s ‘Protestant corridor’ approach to ethical diversity as an important new approach for the European Protestant churches \(Sources 2, 10\). The Assembly asked the CPCE Council ‘to continue to promote the guide … through: drawing together interested professional practitioners in consultation; the production of materials for local use regarding particular topics that arise in pastoral contexts; and the promotion through existing European bodies and networks’ \(Source 5, section 3.2\). It identified various topics arising from the Guide as subjects for further work, including the issue of ethical diversity among the churches as well as specific ethical questions \(ibid.\). 

###  Subsequently the CPCE Council established a new Study Group on Gender and Sexuality, to which Messer was appointed because of his expertise in theological ethics and his prior work on the Guide. As its Chair confirms, this group was instructed by the Council ‘to apply a similar approach to this study work as in the guide on reproductive medicine’ \(Source 10\). This work is ongoing. 

###  \(iii\) Impact on CPCE member churches and other churches 

###  The Guide was presented and discussed at a gathering of CPCE Synod members and two annual meetings of the European Baptist Federation \(Sources 2, 8\). In addition to the original publication languages of English, German and French, translations into Estonian, Polish, Hungarian and Ukrainian have been published or are in preparation \(Sources 2, 8, 9\). 

###  It has been used as a teaching resource for the training of students, pastors and church workers in Estonia, Ukraine, other parts of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia \(Source 8\). Conferences and educational events based on it have been held by member churches in various countries, such as Hungary, Italy and Germany. In addition to church members, these have involved pastoral workers, healthcare professionals, ethics experts and others \(Sources 2, 6, 7\). 

 The Guide has informed public statements and documents from member churches. For example, a public statement by the Protestant Federation of France quotes it, adopting its approach and some of its conclusions \(Sources 2, 4\), and a resource document from the Austrian Protestant diaconal organisation draws extensively on it \(Source 11, citing it as ‘GEKE\-Orientierungshilfe’\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the University of Sheffield has directly impacted on a local regeneration strategy placing heritage at its heart. Sheffield Castle is a significant heritage resource in an area of extensive redevelopment and regeneration in the city centre. Its potential has not yet been fully realised, but by analysing and interrogating excavation data and artefacts, Moreland has revealed the full significance of the site. This research has supported the council to make decisions on funding work in Castlegate, the area surrounding the historical site of the castle, and in their efforts to use the heritage of the site to create a modern sense of place. Moreland has also increased public understanding and engagement with the site through augmented reality and has piloted this approach for use in future decisions about regeneration. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Excavations by University of Sheffield archaeologists James Symonds and Glyn Davies at Sheffield Markets in November and December 2001 demonstrated the survival of substantial remains of Sheffield Castle \(R1\). In 2002 Sheffield Department of Archaeology were commissioned by English Heritage to carry out an assessment of the archives from investigations in the 1920s and 1950s \(R2\). This confirmed the scale and significance of these legacy archives. In 2009, responding to questions raised late in 2008 by Sheffield City Council \(SCC\), Sheffield archaeologists Mark Stenton and Mike McCoy used our detailed knowledge of these archives to model the layout of the main buildings and associated archaeological deposits of Sheffield Castle \(R3\). In 2016, we secured the funding to finally undertake the first comprehensive study of the archives, including new analyses of the artefacts \(R4\). 

 In 2020, Moreland published the results in *Sheffield Castle: Archaeology, Archives, Regeneration, 1927\-2018,* \(R4\) the definitive account of the archaeology and long\-term history of the site of Sheffield Castle. Situating an innovative and meticulous analysis of these unpublished archives and new analyses of not previously studied or understudied artefacts in the context of unpublished lectures, newspaper reports, and redevelopment proposals, Moreland’s research generated new insights into the origins and development of Sheffield Castle, and into the lives of those who lived and worked there. It has shown how the ‘afterlife’ of the castle influenced the urban fabric of early modern Sheffield, and played an important part in its political, cultural, and sporting development. Further, it provides unique insights into the practice of archaeology in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, a pivotal moment in the development of the discipline. Critically, it has generated a detailed understanding of the sequence of deposits and structures across the site – knowledge of immense value to developers and urban planners. 

 *Sheffield Castle: Archaeology, Archives, Regeneration, 1927\-2018* transforms our understanding of the life history of the castle, from its origins through to its ‘sleighting’ on the orders of Parliament in 1646/7. We have shown that the castle was, in fact, only partially demolished, and that both its physical form and fabric, and the idea/memory of it, were major influences on the buildings and topography of 19<sup>th</sup>\- and early 20<sup>th</sup>\-century Sheffield. The bowling green constructed in the early 18<sup>th</sup> century, on what had once been the castle’s courtyard, was probably the first purpose\-built sporting venue in Sheffield. Our new analyses of the artefacts have brought ordinary men and women, often absent in castle studies, into the light of history, revealing, for example, their tastes in footwear, food, and drink, and confirming Sheffield as a centre of pottery production, leather manufacture, and \(of course\!\) cutlery. 

 Moreland’s meticulous investigation of the archives has demonstrated the sophistication of the recording practices that produced them, revealed the unexpected presence of a network of finds specialists who provided reports on metalwork, silver, plants, and more, and highlighted the importance of local archaeological societies. As such his work serves to rehabilitate the reputation and records of earlier generations of amateur archaeologists who have been uncritically denigrated since the professionalisation of the discipline in the 1960s. 

 Moreland has deployed his research to inform an augmented reality \(AR\) model of the castle \(created to emphasise its importance in Sheffield in the Middle Ages\), to contribute to a sense of civic identity that goes beyond stereotypes of ‘Steel City’, and as a step towards imagining possible futures \(R5\).

 Putting heritage at the heart of regeneration strategy 

 In 2013 Sheffield Markets \(which covered an area of c.17,000m<sup>2</sup>\) were closed and moved to the Moor in the west of the city. This new development cost £18 million. This was a direct result of Sheffield excavations and archival research which, having established the scale and importance of the surviving castle remains, informed SCC’s decision to halt the extension of the markets and relocate them, placing the castle remains at the heart of the regeneration of the castle site. 

 A 2014 Heritage Lottery Fund bid, informed by Moreland’s knowledge and expertise, to initiate this regeneration failed, but Moreland then secured funds from the University Alumni Office to address the key ‘known unknowns’ highlighted in the feedback. Moreland thus addressed the question of the quality of the surviving archaeology **\(S1\)** and the publication of archival material from earlier investigations **\(R4\)** which removed a significant block to future regeneration funding and enhanced knowledge of the nature, location, and scale of surviving archaeological structures and deposits **\(S1\)**. 

 Drawing on his archaeological expertise, and in his roles as Chair of the University’s Castlegate Steering Group and University representative on SCC’s Castlegate Partnership, in late 2016 Moreland worked with postgraduate students from the University’s School of Architecture on their *Revealing the Castle* project. Presentations to councillors and to SCC’s Growth Board demonstrated that excavation and regeneration of the castle site could take place in tandem, and persuaded them \(in July 2017\) to spend £786,000 to kickstart this process. This began with new excavations to evaluate the location and quality of the surviving archaeology \(so resolving the second of the ‘known unknowns’\) **\(S2, S3\)**. This key step towards regeneration has been supplemented by over £10 million to demolish and relocate the market, pedestrianize the area, convert Castlegate \(the road\) into a linear park with sustainable urban drainage and cycle routes, and to promote environmental sustainability **\(S3, S4\)**. 

 Moreland’s research was ‘absolutely essential’ in determining the location of excavations by Wessex Archaeology in 2018. It ensured that the most valuable information was recovered and interpreted **\(S5\)**. This work confirmed the existence of an early motte\-and\-bailey castle and detailed the deep history of the area, from the Middle Ages to the present day **\(S5, S6\)**. The scale and nature of the remains encountered ensured that SCC’s regeneration policy will ‘mix heritage and new development’ **\(S5, S6\)**. 

 Moreland’s understanding of Sheffield Castle’s archaeology has been acknowledged by Castlegate Programme Director Simon Ogden as pivotal in framing policies for future development, providing a deeper understanding of the social history of Castlegate, and using this to create a modern identity for the site. The physical remains of the castle and our sense of it as an articulating centre \(of culture, performance, decision making etc.\), as well as the multi\-layered history of the place, will be central to a regeneration which fulfils SCC’s ambition to establish a new role for Castlegate by making it into a distinct place again **\(S5, S6\)**. 

 Enhancing public understanding 

 Market research commissioned by SCC and the University in June 2014 revealed that 46% of those interviewed had never heard of Sheffield Castle and almost everyone else knew little about it **\(S7\)**. To rectify this, Moreland, along with colleagues from the Departments of Archaeology and Computer Science, the Friends of Sheffield Castle, and Human Studio created an \(AR\) reconstruction of the castle within the modern cityscape **\(S8\)**. This visualisation of Moreland’s research, linking heritage to regeneration, premiered at the University's Festival of the Mind in 2018 to 7,199 people **\(S8\)**. A further 8,620 people viewed and interacted with the model at the National Videogame Museum \(2019\) and 4,000 more at the Sheffield Heritage Fair \(2020\). Simon Ogden, speaking of the impact of the AR experience at the latter public event, called it “ *an excellent way of introducing people to the physical setting, landform, and complexities of the site and its history*,” and notes that “ *its real value as a public engagement medium is coming to fruition*” **\(S9\)**. It forms the centrepiece of SCC’s public consultation on the regeneration of the site \(delayed due to COVID\-19 restrictions\) **\(S8, S9\)**. Moreland also devised and presented a short film, celebrating the castle’s history and foregrounding its role in regeneration. It premiered at Festival of the Mind \(2020\) and was followed by a panel discussion, attracting 374 people **\(S5\)**. 

 Dissemination also occurred through dedicated university webpages, social media \(over 150,000 video views on Facebook, 4700 upvotes on Reddit\), excavation open days, AHRC funded walking tours, videos, traditional presentations, TV, radio, national and regional press, and the 2015 Castlegate Festival, which attracted over 1,000 visitors **\(S6, S8, S9, S10\)**. The 2018 excavation blog received over 3,000 hits and 17,000 enquiries **\(S6\)**. The book, which is free in digital format, has been downloaded 903 times since publication in September 2020. As a result of Moreland’s work, the public in Sheffield and beyond now know more about the long\-term significance of the Sheffield Castle site, and recognise the links between past and future regeneration. His approach has also provided a model for future work on ‘legacy archives’. 

 Moreland’s research on the site of Sheffield Castle has had a major impact on local authority decisions on urban planning and on public awareness of the city’s heritage. His work on the archives, his dissemination of the results through open access, and his use of AR to stimulate debate about future regeneration are models with much wider applicability.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Poor Early Childhood Development \( **ECD**\) in low and middle\-income countries is a major public problem, affecting an estimated 250 million children under 5 years. Attanasio’s research has provided the model for a scalable ECD programme which has been replicated, adapted, and implemented by governments in Latin\-America \(Colombia, Peru, Ecuador\) and the largest Education NGO in India to improve ECD and cognition for an estimated 100,000\+ children between 2014\-2021. The Inter\-American Development Bank and World Health Organisation have endorsed the model in published guidance, providing access to Attanasio’s leading ECD research to >17,000 policymakers worldwide.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2008, Orazio Attanasio’s research has focused on the design, implementation and evaluation of a scalable programme to support children to reach their developmental potential. An estimated 250 million children under 5 years old in developing countries fail to reach their developmental potential due to poverty, poor nutrition, and a lack of ‘psychosocial stimulation’ \(the visual, auditory, tactile and emotional stimulation provided via an affectionate caregiver\-child bond\). Research funding has been provided by a grant from the ESRC, the World Bank, the Inter\-American Development Bank \( **IADB**\), and the International Growth Centre \( **IGC**\). 

 **Research Methodology** 

 Attanasio’s research **\[R1\]** designed, implemented, and evaluated the benefits of ‘psychosocial stimulation’ home visits. From 2010\-2011, home visits were delivered weekly for 18 months for 1420 children aged 12\-24 months, across 96 municipalities in central Colombia. Locally\-appointed female community leaders delivered home visits, where they demonstrated play activities which mothers could replicate for their children, using low cost or homemade toys, picture books, and form boards. The aims of the home visits were to improve the quality of maternal\-child interactions, and to assist mothers to participate in developmentally\-appropriate learning activities, often centred around daily routines, which they could easily replicate. The effectiveness of these visits was evaluated based on randomized control trials. 

 A key novel feature of the programme design and evaluation was its scalability: the programme of ‘psychosocial stimulation’ home visits in **\[R1\]** covered a larger scale \(an area approximately the size of California\), targeted a more general poor population \(drawn from the poorest 20% of a nation’s population\), and obtained a markedly larger sample size \(1420 children\) than comparable research on early child development \(ECD\) intervention programmes. The scalability of the programme was achieved by integrating it into existing national welfare programmes: the 1420 beneficiaries were all eligible recipients of the well\-established Colombian national welfare programme ‘Families en Accion’ \(FAO\). FAO is a Conditional Cash Transfer Programme \( **CCT**\), first established in 2002, which has provided the poorest 20% of households in Colombia with payments in exchange for their compliance with childhood healthcare and educational\-attendance requirements. Female community leaders were recruited for the delivery of early\-childhood interventions: the weekly ‘psychosocial stimulation’ home visits were designed to be delivered by local women with no prior specialist early\-childhood development experience. In Colombia, every 50\-60 beneficiaries of the Families en Accion CCT elect one woman as a ‘Madre Lideres’ \(Mother Leader\) to serve as their own representative. All home visitors were drawn from this local network. 

 **Research Findings** 

 The design, implementation, and evaluation of research provided a strong evidence base for a scalable ECD intervention programme. Results published in the British Medical Journal, paper **\[R1\]**, showed that after 18 months the children in the stimulation program in Colombia had significantly higher cognitive skills. The home visits increased “household investment in the quality of the home” as measured against UNICEF’s family care indicator, with significant increases in the variety of play materials and play activities between the primary caregivers and children \(0.53 SD and 0.54 SD, both P<0.01\). Research published in the American Economic Review **\[R2\]** established that the intervention achieved its impact through changes in parental behaviour. Research **\[R1/R2/R3\]** provided the evidence base to show that ECD intervention programmes could successfully be delivered at scale as part of an existing welfare programme. The high compliance rate for home visits, with 81% of scheduled visits taking place, showed the effectiveness of recruiting local female community leaders, in this instance via the FAO CCT, to deliver the psychosocial\-stimulation home visits. 

 A subsequent 2\-year ECD intervention in India during 2013\-2015 **\[R4/R5\]** adjusted the model to be delivered in partnership with Pratham, the largest education NGO in India. It showed that group sessions \(costing USD38 per child per year\) produced equal outcomes to home visits \(costing USD135 per child per year\). This represented a significant enough increase in the return on investment \(3.5x\) to broaden the scale in low and middle\-income countries. In India, 1,449 mothers with children aged 7\-16 months participated in the study, and developmental impacts materialised for children in the first year of the two\-year intervention. 

 Orazio Attanasio was awarded the 2016 Klaus J. Jacobs Research Prize \(endowed with one million Swiss Francs\) on the basis of this research, for having “pushed research frontiers by using economic models in combination with field experiments to assess and shape health and education policies in early childhood development in low\-income and middle\-income settings”. The award was used to fund research in India **\[R4/R5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Poor Early Childhood Development \(ECD\) in low and middle\-income countries is a major public problem, affecting an estimated 250,000,000 children under 5 years, who fail to reach their developmental potential due to poverty, associated lack of poor nutrition, and a lack of psychosocial stimulation \(visual, auditory, tactile and emotional stimulation provided via an affectionate caregiver\-child bond\). Attanasio’s research **\[R1\]** has provided a scalable ECD model which has been replicated, adapted, and implemented by governments in Latin\-America \(Colombia, Peru, Ecuador\) to improve the childhood development and cognition of 100,000\+ children between 2014 and 2021. 

 **Establishing and expanding a scalable cost\-effective ECD programme in Colombia** 

 In 2014\-2016, following research \[leading to the publication of **R1, R3**\] Attanasio adapted his ECD intervention strategy to integrate it into FAMI \(Familia, Mujer e Infancia\) a public large\-scale parenting support service for vulnerable families in rural Colombia\) for the Colombian government. The Director of Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Policies in the National Planning Department in Colombia describes how Attanasio contributed to FAMI’s aim of “seek\[ing\] to promote the integral development of girls and boys in early childhood” through the design of an “intervention that is by construction scalable” which led to evaluation to evidence “impact on cognitive knowledge and nutritional status for the most disadvantaged children” **\[A\]**. They further attest that Attanasio’s research **\[R1/R2/R3\]** has “contributed to date to the policy debate in Colombia and the policy decision\-making” around early\-childhood development **\[A\]**. 

 In June 2017, policy\-makers cited **\[R1\]** in a report by the Early Childhood Workforce Initiative, noting that “stimulation reduced the cognitive gap between poor and wealthy children by nearly one\-third” in Colombia **\[B\]**. Attanasio’s research contributed to the Colombian government taking an evidence\-based approach to ECD policy dialogues and decision\-making. In 2018\-2019, the Colombian Government included 8 studies conducted by Attanasio in an “evidence map” on ECD, specifically created to inform policy **\[C\]**. For Colombia’s National Planning Department, Professor Attanasio’s work and its inclusion in the evidence map “has been important and used to generate helpful information” which “helped policy stakeholders make decisions based on evidence” including interventions that have “positive effects on cognitive development and health, as \[those\] evaluated by Professor Attanasio in Colombia have show\[n\]” **\[A\]**. 

 **Latin American governments’ adoption of the ECD model reaching 100,000\+ children** 

 The Inter\-American Development Bank \(IADB\) promoted Attanasio’s model for scalable early\-childhood interventions **\[R1/R2/R3\]** in Latin American countries, leading to further replication. The Principal Economic Advisor at the IADB attests to the success of the scalability of the model \[from **R1/R2**\]: “Professor Attanasio’s research on a home visiting program in Colombia, published in the *American Economic Review* and the *BMJ*, has been decisive in the scale\-up of these programs in many countries in the region where the IADB provides financial and technical assistance, including Brazil and Peru, where they now benefit hundreds of thousands of poor children and their families” **\[D\]**. 

 The IADB promotion of Attanasio’s scalable model led to the Peruvian government launching an ECD intervention programme which reaches 93,000 children from disadvantaged rural families. To implement the programme, the Peruvian government created a home visit service called Servicio de Acompañamiento Familias \(SAF\). A 2015 evaluation of the programme \(jointly prepared by the IADB and the Peruvian Ministry of Finance\) cited **\[R1\]** several times and evidenced the significance of the SAF intervention upon children as being “equivalent to closing the socioeconomic gap in cognitive performance by 18% and the communication gap for boys and girls in the study sample by 35%” **\[E\]**. 

 Since 2018, the IADB has supported the government in Ecuador to strengthen home visitation services, incorporating lessons from Attanasio’s research in Colombia **\[R1\-R3, FAMI\]**. The Principal Economic Advisor for the Social Sector at IABD credits Attanasio’s research with influencing the design and focus of services: “\[m\]any features of the design of these programs—for example, with regard to the hiring of local women as home visitors, the desirability \(or not\) of including a nutritional component in home visits, and the curriculum — build directly on Professor Attanasio’s papers. \[…\] The Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion of Ecuador is currently revising the technical and operational guides that define childcare provision in public childcare centres for children younger than 36 months\-of\-age to improve their quality. The curricular content is also being revised to highlight the importance of interactions between caregiver and child, a critical element of process quality, as shown by Professor Attanasio’s research” **\[D\]**. 

 **Global expansion of ECD interventions via engagement with NGOs, the IADB, and WHO.** 

 Scalable ECD intervention models are especially needed in India, where in 2016, 63,400,000 children aged under 5 were reported as being at risk of not reaching their developmental potential, more than any other country. Attanasio’s research, in partnership with Pratham, India’s largest education NGO, expanded the scalability of the ECD intervention model to enable NGO\-government partnerships, and proved the efficacy of group interventions. Pratham Education Foundation’s Advisor emphasized the importance of Attanasio’s research in designing scalable cost\-efficient interventions in India: “a detailed cost\-analysis of the intervention shows that a lower\-cost model is feasible, facilitating intervention at scale” and commented on the possibility of “partnerships with state governments or large\-scale community programs in India, potentially impacting millions of children” that Attanasio’s adjusted ECD model have created **\[F\]**. 

 Between publication in September 2014 and 6 October 2020, **\[R1\]** has been downloaded 14,587 times **\[G\]** and frequently cited in reports by policymakers **\[H\]**. In 2015 the IADB published the open\-access book *The Early Years: Child Well\-Being and the Role of Public Policy.* Explicitly directed at an audience of policymakers, the book “offers suggestions for improving public policy in this critical area” **\[I\]**. In the preface, Luis Alberto Moreno, the president of IADB, argued that “Governments can – and should – make a major positive difference \[…\] An investment in a well\-crafted government program, using the tools that we know today can be highly effective, can have a huge development impact” **\[I**, **p. xvi\]**. The IADB consulted Attanasio on “the scope of this publication” and 5 separate outputs by him are cited, including **\[R1\]** **\[I, p. ix\]**. The World Health Organization \(WHO\) cited **\[R1\]** in their 2017 report, ‘An evidence map of social, behavioural and community engagement interventions for reproductive, maternal, new\-born and child health’, which was downloaded 2400 times between April 2020 and September 2020. Publications by the IADB and Inter\-American Development Bank citing **\[R1\]** have been downloaded over 15,000 times, providing access to leading ECD research to policymakers and medical professionals worldwide’.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research conducted at the University of Bath has increased the resilience of Position, Navigation and Timing \(PNT\) systems to the criminal operation of devices that can jam Global Navigation Satellite System \(GNSS\) signals and specifically Global Positioning System \(GPS\) signals. Deliberate jamming can now be detected and located in real time, allowing rapid and efficient law\-enforcement response, and protecting critical infrastructure. Chronos Technology markets two handheld detectors, CTL3510 and CTL3520, developed by the University of Bath and the CTL3530 GPS JammerCam developed in a collaborative project. These are now in use by many police forces in the UK and overseas, and have resulted in the detection and arrest of organized crime activity related to high value asset theft \(30 cars \[text removed for publication\]\). \[text removed for publication\]. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The timing signals from GPS satellites are very weak when they arrive at a receiver on Earth. The signal to noise ratio is much less than one, and a GPS receiver must extract the time and position information by comparing the received signal with templates of the known transmissions of the different satellites at different times when observed from different locations on Earth. When a match is found, that gives the current time and location. 

 Watson undertook research at the University of Bath using the propagation of GPS signals through the atmosphere to map the density of free electrons in the ionosphere by recording the dephasing \(or scintillation\) of the signals received by a fixed ground station in a known location \[1\]. This analysis relied on Watson’s deep understanding of the propagation of electromagnetic waves, both in the bulk of the troposphere and also in the final few 100 metres to the receiver, where local multiple path interference from buildings or traffic can disturb the signal \[2\]. The result of this research was an understanding of how GPS signals can be used to observe the effects on the ionosphere of events like coronal mass ejections from the sun, and conversely how these space weather events can affect GPS navigation and timing on Earth. It also gave Watson a detailed knowledge of the delicate effects of many different natural noise sources on the GPS signals. 

 \[text removed for publication\]With his understanding of the usual variability of noise in the GPS frequency range, and also knowledge of the magnitude of intermittent events associated with space weather, Watson was immediately able to see that the disruption did not fit any of these existing patterns. It quickly became apparent that the events seen by Chronos were man\-made in origin, and Watson set about to devise an instrument able to distinguish automatically between natural and man\-made interference in GPS signals. This interference may also be very weak; the GPS signal is already below the natural noise levels and so can be swamped by something that itself is barely above that background. This makes deliberate GPS jamming devices cheap to buy, but also very difficult to detect. To make a detection system particularly useful it would need to be hand\-held, and would also need to detect the direction of the man\-made noise in order to locate it \[3,4,5,6\]. Watson designed a detection and analysis system to identify different types of additional man\-made noise, which became the product CTL3510 \(late 2013\). He further developed an interferometric detector to give direction information, which became the product CTL3520 \(2013/14\). A particular challenge here was to devise an interferometer that is smaller than the 20 cm wavelength of the GPS signals, in order for the complete system to be hand\-held. 

 Technology transfer to Chronos Technology Ltd was accelerated by three joint Innovate UK projects, GAARDIAN \(TS/G002592/1, 2008\-11\), SENTINEL \(TS/I00257X/1, 2011\-13\) and AJR \(UKRI 131602, 2014\-15\). Continuing engagement between Watson and Chronos Technology has led to the development of the JammerCam \(CTL3530\), which combines jammer\-triggered camera technology with automatic number plate recognition.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research at Bath has translated into economic impact through the development of a new product range and service from Chronos Technology since late 2013, and societal impact through removing threats to critical systems and uncovering criminal activity, resulting in enhanced security for businesses and people. 

 There are many reasons for individuals to use deliberate GPS jammers. Fleet operators often install location systems in their vehicles and individuals may want to defeat that system, for example to conceal personal use of vehicles, to sleep at home rather than a lorry park, or to manipulate working hours. These jammers are small and just plug into the cigarette lighter socket of the vehicle, but the jamming can affect others in the area, including infrastructure. Jammers are also used by criminals, particularly to defeat in\-car GPS tracking systems. High value vehicles often have concealed tracking devices to relay their location if they are stolen. Organised crime gangs targeting vehicle theft use GPS jammers to remove vehicles without them being tracked. \[text removed for publication\]. Criminals may also fear that law enforcement have fitted trackers to their vehicles and so use GPS jammers. Using GPS jamming is itself an offence in the UK, but it is also associated with higher\-level crime. 

 GPS jamming may also be unintentional, for example from faulty installation of GPS equipment causing leakage of the amplified signal that it is using. This may be in vehicles or in fixed installations and will disrupt local systems. 

 **Economic impact** 

 Chronos Technology Ltd is a UK SME specialising in bespoke products for time and frequency synchronisation. In 2016 it had 45 full time staff and a turnover of GBP5,500,000 \[A\]. The collaboration with Bath researchers has led to commercialisation of a new range of products during the REF period: the CTL3510, CTL3520 and CTL3530 GPS jamming detectors \[B\]. **The key features of these products are that they are hand\-held and that they generate alarm signals in real time when jamming is detected.** From August 2013 up until end of December 2020, more than \[text removed for publication\] devices have been sold to the civilian, defence and security markets in the UK and \[text removed for publication\] other countries, \[text removed for publication\]: 

 \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Protection of critical infrastructure** 

 Many critical systems rely on GNSS\-derived timing and navigation, including aviation, shipping, transportation of high\-value or hazardous goods, banking transactions, mobile phone networks and emergency service communications. The protection of these systems is vital to the daily operation of a nation's infrastructure \[D\]. 

 Port systems rely heavily on GPS for container handling and operations can be seriously disrupted by jammers. Chronos have test installations at port entries \(\[text removed for publication\]\) and motorway services in collaboration with UK police \[E\]. These regularly detect and image vehicles carrying jammers \[text removed for publication\]. As an example of the effective protection of port systems using Chronos products, \[text removed for publication\]. 

 Not all jamming is intentional. Chronos detectors are also used to quickly identify jamming signals coming from faulty cables and antennas, enabling rapid restoration of timing information in critical commercial operations \[F\].

 Chronos Technology continue to work with Bath to develop new products. The latest Chronos product to emerge is the “JammerCam” \[H\] and is the first GPS jamming detector in the world to be able to identify and photograph a moving vehicle which is carrying a GPS jammer. This product is currently in trials with various local police forces, with the apprehension of jammer users, seizure of jammers \[text removed for publication\]. 

 **Summary of impact** 

-  Multiple police forces in the UK and across law\-enforcement agencies internationally \(including Europe, USA\[text removed for publication\]\) are now aware of the problem of GNSS jamming and have access to new detection techniques. 

-  The use of the Bath\-Chronos products for jamming detection has had a major impact on law\-enforcement activities in multiple countries including the discovery and retrieval of high\-value assets \(30 cars \[text removed for publication\]\) \[text removed for publication\]\[C,E,G\]. 

-  Critical infrastructure has been protected \[E,F\].

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **What is EIT?** *:* EIT provides impedance changes arising from injection of small electrical currents into an electrode array placed on the subject and the measurement of the subsequent voltages.  It can be used to image organ function in real time \(100 images a second\). Compared with existing technology it is highly portable, inexpensive and lends itself readily to remote imaging in order to save lives. The impact described here evolved from a series of specific developments employing Electrical Impedance Tomography. EIT requires the solution to an inverse problem to create the image of organ function in real time. This requires an accurate geometric finite element \(FE\) model, known as the forward model. 

 **First 2D images **\(1996 –2003\)** 

 Prior to REF2014 Prof Bayford pioneered software resulting in successful generation of the first 2D images of impedance change inside the human head using EIT. This led to a range of applications, including neuronal activity, stroke, visual evoked response and localising epileptic activity \[1\]. 

 **Automatically generating subject\-specific FE models **\(2003 –2007\)** 

 The 2D image work led to development of a method of automatically generating subject\-specific FE models through elastic deformation from electrode position data for brain function \[2\]. In collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital, this work subsequently resulted in the application of EIT for monitoring lung development in pre\-term neonates \[3\]. 

 **Further algorithm development **\(2008 to present\)** 

 Prof Bayford developed a wavelet algebraic multigrid and estimated boundary form \[4\]. With an international team of colleagues, he instigated and developed a Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT \(GREIT\). This could then be used as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of future development of EIT algorithms for enhanced monitoring of lung function \[5\]. 

 This was an award\-winning article in *Physiological Measurement* with significant contribution by the research group at Middlesex comprising accurate forward models of adult male and female thorax, but more specifically of an infant’s thorax. These significant developments of EIT led to four significant grants that ultimately allowed this work to be applied in a clinical setting. The first from EPSRC in 2008, resulted in the contribution to the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software project \(EIDORS\). This is a freely available website that provides software algorithms for forward and inverse modelling for EIT and Diffusion based Optical Tomography in medical and industrial settings. This site is also used worldwide to share data and promote collaboration between groups working in this area \(over 2000 downloads and cited on over 100 published papers\). 

 **Clinical translation and hardware development **\(2016 onwards\)** 

 The research described above allowed the team to develop algorithms and hardware for image reconstruction, parameter measurement and boundary form generation \[6\]. This culminated in the first large scale study monitoring the lung function of 200 neonates \(preterm, high risk\) for 72 hours each. As a result of this work the team at Middlesex University led a successful EU funding application \(Horizon 2020\) for €5M in 2016 for a project entitled “Continuous Regional Analysis Device for Neonate Lung \(CRADL\)” leading to a clinical system for use in neonatal intensive care units. Dr Bardill joined the project in 2016 to progress hardware development, create a new wearable device and continues to be part of the team with Prof Bayford and Dr Tizzard going forward. The work continues with follow\-on funding \(£1.8M\) in early 2020 from EPSRC – “Preterm Neonate/neonatal Embedded Universal Microelectronic wearable, Acquisition for Cardiorespiratory Intensive Therapy” \(PNEUMACRIT, EP/T001240\). This project further develops clinical hardware for bedside monitoring of lung gestation of pre\-term neonates.  The research continues to flourish and diversify with the recent award of £700K from UKRI in 2020 to repurpose the hardware and techniques for monitoring Covid19 pneumonia in adult ITUs: COVID Regional Lung Electrical Impedance Tomography \(CoRLEIT, EP/V044036\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  Software and data impact: 

 \(4.1\) The GREIT algorithm with new forward models is being adopted by a manufacturer of EIT systems \(Swisstom/SenTec\)<sup>1</sup><sup>,</sup> which will represent a significant improvement for commercial medical EIT systems in product development for EIT\-based monitoring of neonate patient respiration and regional air content within patient’s lungs at the bedside. \(2018\) \(5.1\) It has also been adopted by Emergex to extend EIT for other applications including cancer detection. We have also provided new models for these applications \(See 4.2\) 

 The models generated have also been used extensively by other groups internationally that focus on the development of imaging solutions. For example, Bayford and Tizzard, working with Dartmouth College and Florida State University in the USA, have been developing EIT and optical tomography imaging of both adult and neonate human heads and extensive use is being made of the public domain tool \(eidors3d.sourceforge.net/\) in this work. 

 Further work on the automatic generation of subject\-specific forward models, namely the warping algorithm \(2007\), and with Prof. Janet Stocks, Great Ormond St. Hospital \(2007 – 2009\) which formed the basis of extending the process in the current REF period to imaging lung function specifically in neonates in collaboration with Prof. Andreas Demosthenous, Dept. Electronic and Electrical Engineering, UCL. This initial impact led to the CRADL project in 2016 \(5.2\). 

 \(4.2\) The creation of the largest data store for EIT clinical data in the world at Middlesex University \(over 50TBytes\). This resource is in use for ongoing clinical studies \(5.4, 5.5 and 5.6\). This resource is also being used by SenTec to improve their user interface and test their system. 

 The work improved breast tumour imaging in collaboration with Dr Andrea Borsic and Prof. Ryan Halter, Dartmouth College, NHR \(2010\), and is based on using elastic deformation to warp standard or idealised geometry – all of which provided extensions of the public domain toolset. 

 *Hardware impact:* 

 \(4.3\) In addition to its clinical use, the group obtained a patent that describes a flexible wearable device to extract boundary information for the warping algorithm. The system dynamically generates and modifies subject specific forward models in real time. This work addresses the urgent need for objective, non\-invasive measures of lung maturity and development, oxygen requirements and lung function, suitable for use in small, unsedated infants, to define the nature and severity. This led to the following: 

 We have signed an NDA with Swisstom \(now Sentec\) to develop the wearable device \[\(H2020 cradlproject.org\)\(5.3,5.3\)\] and have a patent in place \(Filed in 2015,  [WO2015025113A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2015025113A1/en), European patent number 3035846 2020\). A new wearable device was developed with PEL during CRADL and are submitting a patent before arranging a licensing agreement. 

 The group is also working with Emergex to extend the application of EIT for the detection of cancer. A joint patent \(WO/2010/052503, Detection of Cancer\) is in place with this company. This work is also subject to an NDA, which limits the information we are allowed to disclose in this document.  However, the system is presently being developed to locate new COVID vaccines in animal models in the USA. 

 *Clinical Practice impact:* 

 \(4.4\) Our models have been used successfully to monitor preterm neonates in two clinical studies using the CRADL system with the University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Finland, and the  [Department of Neonatology, Emma Children’s Hospital,  Amsterdam](https://www.narcis.nl/organisation/RecordID/ORG1235469/Language/en).  The group’s electrical impedance tomography system has been used to detect ventilation distribution, end\-expiratory lung impedance \(EELZ\) and tidal impedance variation during monitoring of preterm neonates requiring invasive ventilation and repeated surfactant treatment. This study demonstrated a significant effect of surfactant treatment on lung function \(5.4, 5.6\). This has enabled the use of EIT in new studies for adopting into larger clinical use. 

 Creation of the largest data store for EIT clinical data \(> 50TBytes\). This is an available resource for ongoing clinical studies \(5.9\) including Dartmouth and Florida use of EIDORS. It has 

 been used successfully to monitor preterm neonates in four large\-scale clinical studies \(5.3\). The following organisations have benefited from these resources: 

-  Consultant Paediatric Cardiologists and clinical researchers in the PEDEGO Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Finland \(2015 \- on\-going\) \(5.4\) 

-  The Department of Neonatology, Emma Children’s Hospital Amsterdam undertook the clinical study of CRADL \(5.6\) 

-  Dr Karaoli Nicosia General Hospital \(NGH\), Cyprus also undertook the clinical study. 

 Consultant Neonatologists and clinical researchers at the Royal Hospital for Children, Glasgow,  Scotland are working with the group on a new clinical study related to the PNEUMACRIT<sup>5</sup> project which has been enabled through CRADL \(5.5\). 

 More clinical groups are using EIT as a result of the work at Middlesex and are identifying outcomes for imaging neonate lung function.  The work has led to the recognition that EIT can address the urgent need to improve ventilation strategies in children. It is been clinically used to monitor lung function in neonates and adult patients \(see link to Draeger/Sentec below\) using some of the developments created for neonate imaging \(5.8\). 

 *Industry impact:* 

 \(4.5\) We are also working with PEL \(Printed Electronics Limited\)<sup>7</sup> a UK based technology company providing advanced research and development, concept development and production capability for printed electronics and related functional material structures and systems, to develop print on flexible printed circuits for the EIT neonate system. They are members of the EU Graphene Flagship. PEL has worked with us on the CRADL, PNEUMACRIT and new CoRLEIT projects. PEL 3D printing are working with their commercial abilities to augment those in the Middlesex teams and concurrently we are enabling the company to get new markets and new business opportunities in the future \(5.7\) 

 Cost saving: 

 \(4.6\) EIT estimated cost saving of 928 to 10,705 euros per patient in the Dutch setting or 1,124 to 8,496 euros in the German setting. \(5.10\)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘Football and War’ has achieved impact through collaborations within museums, libraries and related institutions, within schools and in the media. By challenging the myths of the ‘Christmas Truce’ story and bringing the history of football in World War One \(WW1\) to life in children’s plays and commemorative football matches. Through access to and education about iconic artwork, supporting documentaries and public debates our work has provided powerful lessons of how people can triumph in the midst of a conflict. The resonance from this work lives on through the ‘Football Remembers’ project. Through the dialogue between young people and veterans, commemorative activities, memorial artwork and important educational tools around sport, gender and politics. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research at the University of Central Lancashire focusing on the cultural and historical aspects of association football has been conducted since the late 1990s. Since 2001 the university has collaborated with the National Football Museum \(NFM\), then based at Preston North End’s Deepdale Stadium. The International Football Institute \(IFI\) was established in 2003 as a partnership between the University of Central Lancashire and the NFM. The National Football Museum states that: **“The International Football Institute seeks to advance research on all aspects of football, and to make this research available to the widest possible audience, nationally and internationally.”** 

 Within the IFI, Hughson, Adams and Melling’s research challenges existing knowledge on the role of football in relation to war, particularly the mythological constructions that allow football to be used in an ideological way in connection with war. For example, Adams research into the well\-known 'Christmas Truce' story \[4, 5, 6\] finds that football did not effectively provide a means of battlefield détente, as is widely assumed to be the case. Rather than being a source for maintaining a patriotic spirit on the Front, football, more routinely, was found to have provided a recreational means for soldiers to have some exercise and take their minds off the dangers and horrors they experienced and witnessed. Similarly, Adam’s and Hughson’s research into the painting *Gassed* \[3\] found that the artist John Singer Sargent, by depicting a football match in the background, was representing in paint what he observed occurring as leisure time on the Front, rather than making a moral statement about the symbiosis of war and football. While the painter C. R. W. Nevinson was making a critical commentary about football averting the attention of the citizenry from an impending Second World War, Hughson’s research shows that Nevinson’s painting *Any Wintry Afternoon in England* \[2\] has been more generally received as a depiction of the cultural significance of football to quotidian life in industrial and urban communities. 

 Melling’s research on the Dick Kerr Ladies football team \[1\] is largely concerned with dispelling the view that women players were passive social actors who accepted terms for playing football that were served up to them. While circumstances, obviously enough, were significant to what could be done, the women were dynamic actors who, while playing their part in the war effort, used the time to engage in a form of organised sporting activity from which they had previously been excluded. As in the case of the male participants studied in the research of Adams and Hughson, Melling’s research on women players shows how the human enthusiasm to enjoy football has prevailed under the extremely difficult circumstance of both battlefield and war occurring as a backdrop to life.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 A key driver of the impact has been the relationship between the University of Central Lancashire’s International Football Institute and the National Football Museum \(NFM\) \[A\]. This applies especially to the impact related activities of Adams and Hughson. Dr Adams’s main direct impact activity in connection with the National Football Museum was in a consultancy capacity to the major exhibition *The Greater Game: Football & the First World War* \(19 December 2014 – 13 September 2015\) \[B\]. In this capacity, Adams consulted on potential artefacts and delivered a workshop to the staff before the NFM major exhibition. Several of the exhibition cases carried quotes and information attributed to Adams and a quote from him was writ large on the wall above the section dedicated to the Christmas Truces. He was individually mentioned on the acknowledgements board at the exit of the exhibition. His research was used to inform the publication, *The Greater Game: A History of Football in World War I* \(Oxford, Shire Publications, 2014\), which accompanied the exhibition. Furthermore, Adams wrote a play, titled *A Game for Christmas*, which has been used as a teaching resource in primary schools at no cost. The play was made available to schools via Learning and Resources pages of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission website and the resources website of the National Children's Football Alliance \(NCFA\) \[C\]. It was also performed, several times, at the National Football Museum during *The Greater Game: Football & the First World War* exhibition. The play was also performed in a radio version during the two\-week ‘Celebrate Sport’ event, which was held by the BBC at Media City UK. This radio version of *A Game for Christmas* was recorded and disseminated to schools. HRH The Duke of Cambridge, a supporter of the project, remarked: 

 **“We all grew up with the story of soldiers from both sides putting down their arms on Christmas Day, and it remains wholly relevant today as a message of hope over adversity, even in the bleakest of times.” \[C\]** 

 Adams’s research \[3\-6\] has also been used in other broadcast and print media, public talks and events, to disseminate knowledge to the general public and specialist audiences in promoting discussion and debate about football during WWI. Broadcast media include BBC World Service \(global listenership of 150 million per week\) *Sportshour* programme and podcast \[D\], BBC Radio Lancashire’s *Drive Time*, BBC Radio 5 Live’s *The Daily Interview,* and *Radio Hochstift* in Sennelager, Germany. Adams’s research has been cited in numerous British national and local newspapers as well as the international media \(e.g. *The Times, The Independent, The Telegraph* and *The Daily Mail, The Warrington Guardian*\). A number of public and specialist talks have been delivered including five at the National Football Museum. Adams gave two public talks at The National Archives, Kew \(available by podcast\) \[E, F\] and presented a paper at the Ministry of Information Press Centre in Belgrade, Serbia. On 9 December 2014, Adams delivered the ‘Daily Briefing’ to the officers of the 20<sup>th</sup> Armoured Infantry Brigade at Sennelager before the playing of a commemorative football game. In other school related activities, Adams conducted workshops and gave presentations at several local schools, including Cheetham Primary School, Manchester \(19 November 2014\) and John Cross Primary School, Bilsborrow \(24 February 2015\). 

 Adams was invited to appear at the *BBC World War One: The Home Front* roadshow at Blackpool and Blackburn on the 21 and 24 June 2014. The BBC estimated the audiences across the two days at approximately 3,000 people. Adams was a contributing consultant historian to the British Library on the WWI pan\-European ‘Europeana 1914\-1918’ project. He was also a contributing historian on the British Council/Premier League/FA ‘Football Remembers’ project \[G\]. In relation to this project, an education pack was developed and distributed to 30,000 British schools and mass participation events were organised by the British Embassy network around the world. Adams consulted on the staging of a centennial commemorative football game between British and German army units at Sennelager, Germany in December 2014. The game was attended by thousands of soldiers from both armies and several thousand civilians. Each spectator was given a souvenir programme, which included a page overview authored by Adams about how and why football was played in ‘no man’s land’ on the Front during Christmas of 1914. This page was provided in both English and German. 

 The Football Association \(The FA\) invited sculptor Andrew Edwards to create a monument to mark the occasion \[H\]. Edwards approached the National Football Museum for information about the football played on the Front by the troops in 1914 and Adams was, in turn, invited to consult Edwards on preparation of the art item. A full size bronze was unveiled on 22 December 2015 in Messines Town Square, Belgium on a site identified by Adams as in close proximity to a possible game of football between the 6/Cheshires and their German opponents as briefly described in Lt. Brockbank’s diary exhibited at *The Greater Game: Football & the First World War*. A modified resin full\-size statue was displayed at St Luke’s \(“The Bombed\-Out Church”\) in Liverpool from December 14 to 21, 2014 and then at the Christmas Carol Concert at the Anglican Cathedral in Liverpool. Internationally, the resin statue was also displayed on the site of the former truce in no man’s land in Belgium on Christmas Day 2014, and the following day at the Menin Gate Memorial in Ypres, Belgium \[I\]. It was also shown at several football grounds to raise awareness and funds for a permanent memorial. The ‘Football Remembers’ project has impacted WW1 veteran football players and young academy footballers through the veterans sharing their experiences of the war and football during the war \[G\]. 

 As Director of the International Football Institute, Professor Hughson has worked closely with the National Football Museum to ensure the museums interpretations are accessible and appealing whilst being informed by high level curatorial scholarship and expertise \[J\].  Hughson drew on his published research \[2\] on the painting *Any Wintry Afternoon in England* by the British artist C.R.W. Nevinson to advise the National Football Museum to seek a loan of the artwork from its owning institution, the Manchester City Art Gallery. Accordingly, Hughson was involved in discussions regarding the loan with senior staff at both the National Football Museum and the Manchester City Art Gallery. The loan went ahead, and the painting was displayed at the National Football Museum, with key object status, from October 2013 to October 2014. While the painting was on display at the National Football Museum, Hughson gave a number of presentations to the public and provided expert commentary in an educational video made in situ at the National Football Museum in front of the painting. This video was made available as an educational resource to schools. Hughson’s discussion addressed the ‘football and war’ theme regarding Nevinson’s intention in the painting and in regard to subsequent interpretations of the artwork. 

 Melling's research from the 1990s to the present day on the Dick, Kerr Ladies \[1\] football team informed the 2017 Channel 4 television documentary, ‘When Football Banned Women’, presented by broadcaster Clare Balding \[K, L\]. By collaborating with the acclaimed and award\-winning Lambert Productions, Channel 4, Jean Williams, Gail Newsham, and Clare Balding CBE, Professor Melling was able to bring the debate over the 1921 FA ban on women’s football into the wider public domain. ‘When Football Banned Women’ received 500,000 ‘hits’ on the first night of screening, and many more via playback, social media, and the national press. Balding noted, during her narration of the documentary, that many of the young women players today had no concept of the game’s history or the struggles their predecessors experienced. This media collaboration therefore acts not only as a vehicle of information, but also as an important tool of informal education around sport, gender and politics. Furthermore, the documentary utilises Melling’s research in understanding the political connotations associated with the FA’s ban on women’s football, highlighting the change of women’s football from fundraising for charities to supporting war\-wounded families to focusing on supporting the striking miners. Women’s football and sport journalist, Suzanne Wrack highlights that **“With the war over, their fundraising turned to support for workers in struggle, and in particular for the striking miners. “You had women playing football and striking miners, and huge crowds watching them. The whole thing was revolutionary,” says Dr Melling”** \[M\].  Wrack describes the documentary as **“Inspiring, moving and analytical.”** \[M\] In May 2019, the British Library hosted a screening of the documentary, followed by a public debate chaired by Clare Balding \[L\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The issue of prisoner voting has come close to rupturing the UK’s place in the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\). Colin Murray served as the only Specialist Adviser to the UK Parliament’s Joint Committee on the Draft Voting Eligibility \(Prisoners\) Bill, shaping its conclusion that short\-term prisoners should be enfranchised. Given the implacable opposition of successive UK governments to enfranchising prisoners, the Committee’s support for this proposal illustrates the significance of Murray’s contribution and the UK Government abandoned draft legislation which would have breached the ECHR. The Scottish Government and a Welsh Assembly Committee have thereafter drawn upon Murray’s research in justifying their support for enfranchising thousands of prisoners. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Colin Murray’s research has reshaped the political debate on prisoner voting in the United Kingdom. As the Coalition Government entered office in 2010 the Conservative Party rebuffed the European Court’s *Hirst* judgment, arguing that the very concept of prisoner voting was alien not only to the UK’s legal order but to the ECHR. Through successive academic articles published 2011\-3, Murray challenged this narrative, establishing not only that prisoner voting was justifiable under Article 3 of Protocol 1, ECHR **\[PUB1 and PUB2\]**, but also demonstrating that a sizeable proportion of the United Kingdom’s prison population had exercised the vote between the 1940s and 1960s **\[PUB3\]**. 

 The clash between the UK and the Court over prisoner voting has come to overshadow other aspects of their relationship, with ministers insisting that the UK would rather withdraw from the ECHR than comply with this ruling. Murray’s research into this clash first explored how the prisoner enfranchisement cases before the UK’s domestic courts exemplify the ambiguity which has resulted from failures to develop “a clear and stable conception of the prisoner’s legal status” **\[PUB1\]**. Successive UK governments were, as a result, able to manipulate the continuing uncertainty of many members of the judiciary regarding the legal status of prisoners, even in the Human Rights Act era. 

 His research also examines how fundamental misinterpretations of the European Court’s *Hirst* judgment and subsequent case law contributed to the saga of prisoner disenfranchisement **\[PUB2\]**. This article argues that a reform to prisoner voting could have been achieved in line with the communitarianism espoused by New Labour. Instead of grasping this opportunity to refine restrictions on voting, the Labour Government sought to protect its ‘tough\-on\-crime’ credentials by stalling on a response to the judgment. This approach not only sustained a narrative of conflict between the UK and the Court, but ultimately made the situation more intractable, by denying the possibility of “minimum compliance” approaches to prisoners’ right to vote. 

 Murray’s research then uncovered that parliamentary debates and official consultation documents on prisoner disenfranchisement had overlooked the complex history of prisoner participation in the political process in the UK. Most importantly, he detailed how many prisoners serving sentences of less than one year were enfranchised in the decades after the Second World War, and was the first scholar to connect these developments to the contemporary dispute over prisoner voting **\[PUB3\]**. This scholarship highlighted the reasons why the UK moved backwards on prisoner voting rights in 1969, and why recent debates on prisoner voting rights treated the idea of prisoner voting as an assault on the UK Constitution **\[PUB4\]**. Murray explored the range of discourses, including penal populism, Euro\-scepticism, concern over the juridification of the UK’s system of government and the trivialisation of human rights, which underpinned parliamentary discussion of prisoner enfranchisement. He reasserted the primary significance of the right to vote to the nature of democratic society.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 In 2013 prisoner voting was the defining issue in the UK’s relationship with ECHR institutions. So significant was it that a Joint Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament was established in 2013 to assess the Coalition Government’s Draft Voting Eligibility \(Prisoners\) Bill. Against a backdrop of increasingly politicised opposition to the European Court’s *Hirst* judgment, the Committee provided a unique opportunity to immerse a small group of parliamentarians in research on prisoner voting and challenge received wisdom. Murray’s published research influenced all aspects of this Committee’s work and conclusions, and has since reshaped debates on prisoner voting in Wales and Scotland. 

 <ins>Shaping the Joint Committee’s Influential Report</ins> 

 The appointment of a joint select committee to consider a specific draft Bill is exceptional, and a mark of the complexity and importance of prisoner voting. Murray was able to foreground the history of prisoners voting and explain the human rights context in sessions between September and December 2013, giving the majority a new appreciation of the issues at stake **\[IMP1\]**. 

 In this role Murray shaped the Committee’s proceedings. As the Legal Adviser to the Committee attests, Murray not only “assisted in the task of identifying witnesses who could make valuable contributions” but also “contributed to the preparation of briefing documents and suggested questions for parliamentarians ahead of Committee evidence sessions” **\[IMP2\]**. He confirms that, in November and December 2013, Murray was involved in the “drafting of the Committee’s report”, contributing to large sections of Chapters 2, 3 and 4 \(contributions to drafting are not directly attributed within Select Committee Reports\) **\[IMP2\]**. 

 A majority of the committee \(including two Conservative members\) supported enfranchising a substantial number of prisoners in its December 2013 Report **\[IMP3\]**. This conclusion drew directly upon the ‘historical justification’ for enfranchising prisoners serving sentences of less than one year which was highlighted by Murray’s research **\[PUB3\] \[IMP3\]**. As Committee member Lord Norton recognised, “\[t\]he majority Report was directly reliant upon Colin’s research in its conclusion that prisoners serving sentences of up to 12 months should be enfranchised” **\[IMP1\]**. The Committee’s Legal Adviser affirms that “Colin’s research findings that prisoner voting was not alien to the UK’s governance order helped to underpin the majority conclusion” **\[IMP2\]**. The adoption of this proposal alone would enfranchise some 11,000 prisoners **\[IMP3\]**. 

 The Report received extensive media coverage, being heralded in the UK Human Rights blog as “a powerful statement of the Government’s rule of law responsibilities as well as a crushing indictment of the current policy” **\[IMP4\]**. Within civil\-society, the Howard League for Penal Reform advocated for prisoner voting on the basis of the Report **\[IMP4\]**. The Report also received the backing of Parliament’s respected Joint Committee on Human Rights **\[IMP5\]**, which asserted that following the Report would secure the UK’s ECHR obligations. 

 As a result of the Committee’s comprehensive rejection of the Government’s Draft Voting Eligibility \(Prisoners\) Bill, which proposed to ban all voting by any prisoners in the face of the *Hirst* judgment, this legislative proposal was revisited **\[IMP6\]** and was subsequently abandoned. In 2017, the UK Government adopted an administrative scheme to enfranchise day\-release prisoners, drawing on “minimal\-compliance” ideas explored in the Committee’s Report **\[IMP3\]** and previously developed within Murray’s research **\[PUB1\]**. As a result, some prisoners \(roughly 100 on any given day\) have regained their voice within the democratic process and a struggle which had so undermined the UK’s relationship with the ECHR was partially resolved. 

 <ins>Advancing new policy approaches in Scotland and Wales</ins> 

 Competences over electoral law were not devolved to Scotland and Wales until 2016/17. Murray’s evidence to the Scottish Parliament’s Equality and Human Rights Committee \(February 2018\) and to the Welsh Assembly’s Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee \(January 2019\) have shaped the subsequent debate within these jurisdictions. 

 In recommending that all Scottish prisoners should be enfranchised, the Equality and Human Rights Committee acknowledged the importance of the 2013 Joint Committee report **\[IMP7\]** and echoed Murray’s evidence that the UK Government’s administrative enfranchisement of a few prisoners would be unlikely to satisfy the European Court **\[IMP7\]**. The Welsh Assembly’s Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee drew on Murray’s evidence repeatedly in their report **\[IMP8\]** and explicitly relied upon his evidence as the specific basis for its conclusion that prisoners serving sentences of under four years should be enfranchised **\[IMP8\]**. 

 Both the Welsh and Scottish Governments have responded favourably to these reports in 2019. The Welsh Government has committed to legislating for exactly the approach recommended by the Committee on the basis of Murray’s evidence **\[IMP9\]**. Its current proposals could enfranchise as many as 1,700 in Wales. The Scottish Government team working on the Scottish Elections \(Franchise and Representation\) Bill convened a special research briefing with Murray in August 2019. His ‘useful’ advice has influenced the presentation of the Bill, which proposes the enfranchisement of prisoners serving sentences of up to one year, to the Scottish Parliament **\[IMP10\]**. Prior to Murray’s engagement the Scottish Government relied largely upon human rights obligations to justify the new legislation, whereas Murray’s advice contributed a range of supporting arguments grounded in the nature of democracy, rehabilitation and Scotland’s autonomy. The Scottish Elections \(Franchise and Representation\) Act was passed in February 2020, restoring the vote for roughly 2,000 prisoners \(on current figures\) in Scottish Parliament and Local Government elections.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Leeson’s research uses participatory arts practice to access locally held knowledge to create social and environmental change. Through the community\-based research project *Active Energy,* Leeson’ work has resulted in the following key impacts: \(1\) Increased learning and participation: Leeson collaborated with senior men’s group The Geezers in Bow, East London, activating their life experience, culminative skills and knowledge to rethink technologies and better support themselves, their community and the environment. This resulted in the design and realisation of engineered solutions which utilise tidal power to produce low cost, clean energy; \(2\) Enhanced wellbeing, through increased confidence, self\-esteem and sense of purpose for older participants in the *Active Energy* project; \(3\) Improved understanding, by developing new narratives around water conservation in communities in water\-scarce Rajasthan, India. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Leeson’s research focuses on the role of art in social and environmental change through bringing community\-based knowledge into the public domain. Set against Leeson’s wider body of socially situated art practice, ‘a field that she helped to pioneer’ \(Gregory Sholette, Queens College CUNY, USA; In: Leeson 2017, Cover Endorsement **\[3.1\]**\), is the key research project *Active Energy*. It originated in 2007 as an arts\-based response to research at Queen Mary University of London on the democratisation of technology, which highlighted exclusion of older people from technological development. Leeson’s contribution was to work with The Geezers, a group of retired men based at an AgeUK centre in Bow, East London. The Geezers’ chosen technological focus combined concerns over fuel poverty with what they saw as the obvious solution in the locality, the Thames as a source of tidal power. In 2008 this resulted in *GeezerPower*, an exhibition with a large\-scale visualisation and projected interviews and The Geezers’ contribution to a symposium, where they made the case for the introduction of tidal power to support riverside communities. Since 2012, Leeson’s partnership with The Geezers has developed to design, build and install engineered solutions to resolve environmental issues with local impact and global relevance. 

 In 2013 The Geezers’ ideas relating to the production of low\-cost energy from local resource, supported by engineers Toby Borland and Professor Stephen Dodds at University of East London, resulted in the design and creation of a low budget, small\-scale turbine that functioned effectively in slow\-moving tidal rivers. Installed on a Thames barge opposite the Houses of Parliament \(October 2013\), the turbine was created from readily available parts and open\-source software **\[3.2\]**. This collaboration between artist, engineers and community proved transferable, with the engineers identifying its potential for locations where low\-cost accessible solutions would be advantageous, such as developing countries. 

 *Active Energy* subsequently progressed through the AHRC *Towards Hydrocitizenship* project \(2014\-2017\), researching the contribution of creative processes to the ways citizens related to, and took responsibility for, water in their neighbourhoods. Here, Leeson and The Geezers, with continued engineering input from Toby Borland, addressed river pollution by utilising renewable energy. Floating water wheels were developed and installed on the River Lee at Three Mills \(2017\) and in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \(2019\), utilising tidal flow to drive aerators which oxygenated the water and counteracted the effects of river pollution **\[3.3\]**. The experience of The Geezers, as with many older people, is of being overlooked in terms of their perceived contribution to society. *Active Energy* demonstrates the value of their ideas and opinions in developing solutions to environmental issues and illustrates the benefits of collaboration to harness different perspectives on shared concerns. Integral to this has been the use of inter\-generational workshops and events, extending knowledge and understanding uncovered to influence the learning, thinking and action of wider social groups. For example, The Geezers have acted as mentors for secondary pupils from Bow School; and in 2019 an event in the Olympic Park brought participants and the wider community together with regional environmental policy makers to exchange ideas regarding addressing climate change. 

 *Active Energy* is a case study in Leeson’s monograph *Art:Process:Change – Inside a socially situated practice* \(2017\), exemplifying how processes of community involvement can lead to citizen\-led innovation **\[3.1\]**. Key to Leeson’s methodology is collaboration with local groups where participants determine the focus of the work, in this case the generation of sustainable energy to address local need. The location of the project amongst the East London communities with which Leeson has conducted most of her practice, reflects the notion of ‘situatedness’ examined in her monograph, whereby deep understanding of community dynamics and place enhances the relevance and effectiveness of creative process and output. *Art:Process:Change* also describes the approach developed through *Active Energy* as one that enables a ‘drilling down’ into knowledge held in a particular locale, and in so doing creates solutions applicable to other situations. Art nevertheless remains the overarching discipline, creating meaning while bringing together disparate alliances to realise practical outcomes. Leeson’s chapter ‘Water Power’ in *Water, meaning and creativity: understanding human\-water relationships* \(2018\), recognises this value of ‘unlocking community knowledge’ in East London’s riverside communities, where the practical reality of the Thames sustaining life has persisted for generations **\[3.4\]**. 

 Work undertaken with social scientist Dr. Michael Buser, University of West of England \(UWE\) through *Towards* *Hydrocitizenship*, led to Leeson’s participation \(as Co\-I\) in two further AHRC projects investigating uses of art to address urgent social/environmental issues. *Jal\! Cultures of Water in Rural Rajasthan* \(2017\-2018\) explored how participatory arts practice could contribute to increased understanding of, and present solutions to, water scarcity in Rajasthan, India’s driest state; and *The Art of Healing in Kashmir* \(2020\-2021\) supports children traumatised by political events in Kashmir though puppetry and arts\-based therapies.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *Active Energy* has brought communities together to address local environmental issues, use and develop knowledge, and devise and present solutions, while enhancing well\-being and providing a sense of purpose. The many beneficiaries have included older participants, school and college students and local stakeholders in Bow, East London, as well as NGOs and residents in the desert regions of Rajasthan. The three main areas of impact are: 

  

 **1. Impact on learning and participation: Communities addressing environmental issues through collaborative art practice.** During the impact period *Active Energy* brought together members of the Bow community with local stakeholders to develop engineered solutions to issues affecting their lives and locality. The design and realisation of technical solutions to address environmental challenges not only utilised existing skills and understanding in the community, but developed and built on these to provide a focus for discussion and debate. The Geezers \(approx. 15 members\) became ‘local experts’ on renewable energy and shared their knowledge through their website, talks, and workshops. They report how they have ‘learned a lot about the environment, particularly our local rivers \- not only what they can do for us but what needs to be done to keep them clean and a good habitat for wildlife. We hope that what we have done will contribute to that and serve as a model for others to follow.’ They also describe how the project ‘hasn’t just been for us \[...\] we have spread the word about what we have learned and what we think should be done’ **\[5.1a\]**. They regularly document their involvement in the project on their community website, *Our Bow* **\[5.1b\]** to pass new knowledge and experiences to their peers. Between April 2019 and March 2020, the website attracted 19,753 visitors, 75% over the age of 50. In addition, The Geezers have spoken at *Active Energy* launch events at Tamesis Dock \(8 October 2013\), Three Mills \(13 May 2017\) and the Olympic Park \(20 September 2019\), presented at a virtual symposium with University of Highlands and Islands \(31 May 2017\) and Canal Connections, Leeds \(23 June 2017\), and been interviewed for *The Environment* magazine \(16 November 2018\) and for the book *Culture, Communities and Climate* \(ed. Richard Povall, art.earth, 2020\) \(17 December 2019\). *The Environment* featured *Active Energy* in both its February and November 2019 editions **\[5.2\]**, reporting on The Geezers’ ambition to use tidal power to produce renewable energy for the local area and the challenge represented by the project to lack of involvement by older people in technological development **\[5.2\]**. In 2016, *Active Energy* was awarded RegenSW’s Arts and Green Energy prize recognising ‘the crucial role that creative practitioners play in challenging, deepening and broadening the energy debate’ **\[5.3\]**. 

 Stakeholder involvement in *Active Energy* indicates the wider significance and relevance of this project to discourse around environmental concerns. Each water wheel was funded by £10,000 from the National Lottery and supported by the Canal and River Trust, London Legacy Development Corporation \(LLDC\), and Thames21, a charity which works to protect London’s waterways. The second wheel was installed \(June 2019 – February 20\) in a prominent position at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \(run by LLDC\) between the Aquatics Centre and ArcelorMittal Orbit, where it could be seen from both sides of the river by approximately 2.8 million visitors to the park. For LLDC *Active Energy* ‘provided an opportunity to support a local community project focused on the climate emergency to demonstrate how the Park can also be used to trial and test smaller scale low technology initiatives.’ They highlighted how it presented a way ‘to help improve oxygen levels in the river and demonstrated a simple CleanTech initiative with biodiversity benefits,’ and gave a ‘tangible example of a community innovation initiative, demonstrating to stakeholders including the GLA how we are supporting local communities to be more climate resilient’ **\[5.4\]**. The LLDC also highlighted the intergenerational aspects of *Active Energy* as a reason for their support, as it ‘brought together different groups in the local community, including older people and schools.’ Workshops with The Geezers helped embed knowledge from the project into young people’s learning at nearby Bow School \(13 science students in Jun 2019\) and City and Islington College \(8 engineering students on placement with Canal and River Trust in November 2019\-January 2020\). Bow School describe how students extended ‘their knowledge about ‘energy transfers’’ and described the teaching materials as ‘highly valuable’ and how they will use processes and information from the project ‘every year for the STEM activities;’ with students building ‘these models to enhance their problem solving, mathematical, creative and scientific skills.’ The school is also incorporating the project resources into the energy topic for Key Stage 3 **\[5.5a\]**. Similarly, the City and Islington college will use ‘the project templates, materials as well the workshop instructions \[…\] to plan future workshops with other engineering students,’ reporting how *Active Energy* had given the students ‘an insight into how to work sustainably within their vocational area’ **\[5.6\]**.  At the event to launch the water wheel at the Olympic Park, young and older participants questioned the GLA Senior Manager for Energy and Climate Change, with pupils participating ‘inquisitively in the Question and Answer session enabling them to understand more about the solutions to these problems’ **\[5.5b\]**. 

 **2. Impact on wellbeing: Increased confidence, self\-esteem and sense of purpose** **for** **older participants** *. Active Energy* was developed with members of The Geezers at an AgeUK centre in Bow, Tower Hamlets, one of the UK’s poorest boroughs, where isolation of older people is exacerbated by lack of resources. The Geezers Club was established to counter loneliness and isolation, and involvement in *Active Energy* has supported this aim and provided the group with an increased sense of purpose and worth. In common with many of their peers, this group of retired working\-class men felt the contribution they could make to society was undervalued and overlooked. The Geezers describe how involvement in *Active Energy* has given them a ‘good reason to get together and go out and about to explore places \[…\] and do our research. We have met so many interesting people and feel that the project has broadened our minds as well as our horizons. Most importantly… it was something that we ourselves decided to do and have felt that it is our interest and past experience and skills that has made it all happen.’ They report increased confidence and self\-esteem, highlighting how ‘presenting our ideas to other people and the way they have listened to us has made us feel positive about what we have to offer, even though the ideas of people of our age are often overlooked’ **\[5.1a\]**. At the Three Mills water wheel launch event \(May 2017\), the Chief Executive at AgeUK East London, Jane Caldwell highlighted ‘the value of older people’s experience to the wider society, together with the benefits of creative and purposeful activities to those involved’ **\[5.7\]**. Following installation of the Three Mills water wheel, seven of the group were interviewed. They reported that involvement in *Active Energy* gave a feeling of achievement, sense of purpose and well\-being. They felt ‘part of something’ and it provided ‘something to get up for in the morning.’ They highlighted that the project ‘didn’t put people in boxes,’ but rather valued what each had to offer and gave them an opportunity to have their say. One member of the group described how he was advised to get involved in creative work after enforced retirement following a brain injury. He particularly valued the purposeful nature of the project, which he said ‘stopped him from vegetating’ **\[5.8\]**. 

 **3. Impact on understanding: Changing narratives relating to water management in Rajasthan, India**. For *Jal\! Cultures of Water in Rural Rajasthan* \(2017\-2018\) Leeson, in collaboration with Dr Michael Buser \(UWE\), worked with NGOs Centre for Environment and Development Studies in Jaipur \(CEDSJ\) and Ramkrishan Jaidayal Dalmia Seva Sansthan \(RJDSS\) using community\-based arts to promote traditional solutions to water scarcity in India’s driest state. This project was inspired by Buser’s experience of *Active Energy* as part of *Towards* *Hydrocitizenship,* on which he was a Co\-Investigator. Buser saw *Active Energy* as ‘a prime example of how artists can support communities and individuals in making real change in the world and their lives’ **\[5.9\]**. The project was based in the village of Jhakhoda \(population 3,068\), an area experiencing water challenges whose needs are not being met by modern structures for water distribution. Many experts in India advocate a return to traditional methods of water conservation such as rainwater harvesting; however, community memory of these methods had been lost and there was an urgent need to re\-establish intergenerational communication. Reflecting *Active Energy*, local artists engaged with the community to both uncover and express this knowledge, using traditional cultural forms such as mural painting to which local people readily related as a means of communication. Outcomes included an artwork created as a 10ft by 22ft painted wall mural and as a large fabric scroll, containing the story of the loss of traditional methods of rainwater harvesting and the potential outcomes of their reintroduction. Created over a 10\-day period, the mural became a focal point in the village. It was found that an arts\-based approach ‘increased discussion and engagement on issues of water management within the specific social and cultural context of the village and region’ and ‘inspired a shift beyond purely technical narratives and towards a deeper cultural understanding and expression of water’ **\[5.10a\]**. Residents highlighted the importance of the artwork commenting that after ‘seeing the painting, people will be careful with the water;’ ‘people will become conscious of the value of water and how to use it’; and ‘when it rains, we should make tanks to collect the water and connect our homes to the tanks with pipes, and the rain water collected will be available in our hour of need’ **\[5.10b\].** Referencing the success of utilising arts in this way one participating artist noted, ‘\[I\]t is rare that somebody approaches us from this perspective that the art could contribute in this manner; mostly artists are invited \[…\] for aesthetic purposes, to beautify a place, but not to do this kind of communication. \[…\] I’m going to show pictures of this wall and show it in my village and in my city \[…\] it will motivate them to do it more’ **\[5.10a\]**. The scroll is now used by the NGOs in other villages and ‘describing its value to their outreach efforts,’ the RJDSS manager said ‘usually we take technical drawings which are hard for people to understand but this will make it easier for us to explain it to them in their language using these pictures. Explaining the technical with a cultural tool’ **\[5.10b\].**

1.  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UAL has been instrumental in developing and promulgating ‘social design’, making a fundamental contribution to the intellectual evolution of this research field, by supporting a group of key scholars across the University to devise, develop and evaluate methodologies derived from an expanded notion of social design. The work of this group plays a key role in delivering UAL’s research strategy and has had impact nationally and internationally, enabling the practical application of collaborative design thinking to real world situations. Impact is evident across the public sector—in both central and local government—as well as in the private sector and civil society, reframing debates and generating new knowledge and practices in participation and engagement to produce positive outcomes for the lives of individuals and communities. 
","
1.  **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Social design takes as its object not the design of products, communications, services or buildings but the design of society itself. UAL’s social design research focuses on developing and putting into practice a range of methodologies that draw upon research traditions in design, the humanities and social sciences. The UAL research team has built from existing models of social design, and evolved new and varied approaches to the field, maximising real world impact. This work is part of UAL’s objective to develop research that contributes to improving community resilience, and life\-long health and wellbeing. This work has developed at the University in a number of ways, as detailed below. 

 **Thorpe** \(co\-authored with Gamman\) first made the case for socially responsive design in ‘What is Socially Responsive Design? A theory and practice review’, examining decision\-making in response to social context. His 2011, peer\-reviewed research paper \(also with Gamman\) \[3.1\] took this thinking further, analysing how locating designers as co\-actors within a co\-design process can trigger and support meaningful social change. 

 **Malpass**’ work is situated in Design Studies. His 2013 peer\-reviewed journal article, published as a UAL Early Career Researcher \(ECR\), proposed three distinct types of critical practice in design, providing an analysis that constituted a new and significant way to examine the reflexivity of critical design practitioners. Together with an ongoing investigation by **Malpass** into critical practice, this research challenged established discourse and presented alternative roles for product design to those driven by technological and fiscal concerns. \[3.2\] 

 **Kimbell**’s research continues her long\-standing investigations into social design. Examples here are the application of design methods and expertise to social innovation, public services, policy and healthcare. These fields of practice and emergent disciplines exist within a wider context in which design approaches are increasingly visible and integrated into business \(e.g. customer experience design\), entrepreneurship \(e.g. lean start\-up\) and technological innovation \(e.g. agile product development\). 

 **Prendiville**’s extensive and ongoing programme of research around service design examines the potential for design to act as ‘bridge\-maker’ between disciplines and stakeholders. Key is a human\-centred, multi\-disciplinary approach to the design and communication of new processes, products and technologies. Adopting methods and concepts from anthropology, the research leading to **Prendiville**’s 2015 paper \[3.4\] reframed the importance of place and placemaking in the design of services for the elderly at two projects in Byker, Newcastle. 

 To further research and interrogate the debates around social design, UAL enabled a three\-year Visiting Chair post for influential researcher **Manzini**. *Design, when everybody designs* \(2015\) \[3.5\], written during his tenure at UAL, continued an investigation into what design can do to support social innovation, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration to transform practice. **Manzini** identified and interrogated initiatives ranging across community sharing of services for positive economic and environmental gain, new forms of exchange and barter, and neighbourhood gardens initiated and managed by citizens, to improve the quality of the city and the social fabric.

1.  **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 By enabling cross\-disciplinary work around social design across the University, and making key academic appointments, UAL has created a space to challenge, question and develop a varied set of approaches to the field. UAL’s Social Design Institute \(SDI\) is a major milestone in the development of the field \(pilot year 2019–20; first full year 2020/21, AKO Foundation, GBP300,000, 2018–19/2019–20\). Under the leadership of **Kimbell**, the Institute harnesses the potential of social design to address a multitude of large\-scale, complex challenges, with cross\-disciplinary work a priority. It has built on and expanded the strong work in this field already being produced by the group of researchers in this case study, while two recent Institute appointments— Patrycja Kaszynska, Senior Research Fellow \(2019\) and Jocelyn Bailey, Research Fellow \(2019\)—build on its core themes of values, systems and policy. 

 **Kimbell**’s research in design for policy—including a fellowship in the UK Policy Lab through an AHRC award—led to a role as consultant, supporting the EU Policy Lab team on the European Commission’s *The Future of Government 2030 project* \(2018–2019\). **Kimbell** co\-authored the report, which resulted in policy recommendations: “… \[It\] explored changing power relationships in society and new governance models and actors. The project examined stronger alliances of local governments through new types of political institutions \(such as the European Parliament of Mayors\) and stronger inclusion of individuals in policymaking through Citizen Councils. It has also proposed better synergies between the public and private sectors…”. \[5.1.\] This research and practice led to invitations to speak at events organised by the EU Joint Research Centre, Nesta, Danish Design Centre, Carnegie Mellon University and others and involvement in training UK and international civil servants in design thinking. 

 A key component of UAL’s social design work is the Public Collaboration Lab \(PCL, from 2015\), led by **Thorpe**. PCL is a strategic, AHRC\-funded research collaboration created to investigate what models might bring together citizens, local government, academic research and other agencies to facilitate collaborative action that delivers sustainable benefits to the public. PCL provides a vehicle for engagement with structures that deliver services, applying conceptual, abstract thinking to real world situations. The PCL was founded by the UAL DESIS Lab and the Strategy and Change team of Camden Council. UAL initiators included **Thorpe** and **Prendiville**, working closely with UAL colleagues in Knowledge Exchange. The University has supported the practical application of design innovation in particular relationship to its locality—in this case, a strategic collaboration in King’s Cross, London Borough of Camden. In the 18 months of the AHRC funding period, PCL worked with over 3,000 Camden residents, over 100 council officers from nine local authorities, and more than five schools. \[5.2.\] 

 Over four years, PCL has delivered more than 20 projects, designed by council officers and Heads of Service in collaboration with UAL researchers and community leaders, to be strategically useful to the council and the residents it serves. The project uses design\-led social innovation approaches to engage citizens and other stakeholders in the co\-design and co\-delivery of aspects of public services. Examples include the Home & Community Library Service \(H&CLS\) project that applied the methodology developed by the PCL research to navigate between user needs and the council, re\-thinking the council’s interaction with residents to improve the service for 400–500 Camden residents unable to leave their homes. The findings fed into a consultation document on the future of the H&CLS, which was delivered to council members. The ‘Overcrowded Living’ project engaged Camden residents, council officers and other stakeholders to examine the challenges faced by those living in overcrowded conditions to identify opportunities to improve the situation. A toolkit, website and further recommendations for phase two of the project, which is developing a ‘public and collaborative’ service model \(service delivered with and by service participants\) for design and manufacture of bespoke furniture appropriate to overcrowded conditions, has been well\-received by LBC officers and is being developed with the council's housing team. 

 “PCL has evolved from designing services to meet the needs of residents to creating a space which channels the collective creativity and imagination of our residents and partners into new platforms for innovation that are rooted in the distinctive identities of our neighbourhoods. It’s shown that you can develop a collaboration lab which works out in the open, helps residents and partners make and reinvent solutions together to local issues and scale them at a very human level”—Head of Corporate Strategy, London Borough of Camden. \[5.3.\] Other evaluations are positive: *“…* the PCL offered a very positive experience for all those involved. All interviewees could … identify a range of benefits from being involved, including a closer strategic collaboration between UAL and LBC, bringing innovation into the council, and creating a different type and quality of engagement with residents *.”* \[5.4.\] 

 Launched in September 2019 and located on a site behind the British Library in Somers Town, MAKE@Story Garden is a collaboration between UAL, Somers Town Community Association, LBC and property developer Lendlease. Developed by UAL to provide a local base for the work carried out by PCL, MAKE has delivered 169 workshops/activities/events engaging 1,694 participants \(1,339 local residents and 355 students\). The project’s Instagram posts have generated more than 17,000 hits. Nine community organisations have co\-delivered activities with MAKE to date. \[5.5.\] 

#  In 2019, UAL secured Horizon 2020 funding to extend the learning from projects including PCL and MAKE. T\-Factor \(2020–2024\), ‘Unleashing future\-facing urban hubs through culture and creativity\-led strategies of transformative time’, \(overall project budget EUR8,605,612.50\) challenges the ‘waiting time’ or ‘meanwhile’ in urban regeneration—the time between the development of the masterplan and the infrastructure being built—to demonstrate how culture and creative collaboration between academia, government, community and business can create inclusive urban hubs. With partners in Amsterdam, Bilbao, Kaunas, Lisbon and Milan, UAL is contributing to the London pilot by applying expertise in co\-design, creative public engagement and placemaking in London’s Euston regeneration area. 

 The reach and significance of **Prendiville**’s pioneering research is extensive, attracting significant funding. Central to her work is knowledge co\-creation through dialogue with project stakeholders. The notion of ‘placemaking’ \(e.g. a geographical location or a local authority\) links much of **Prendiville**’s work, from the Byker project, to the PCL, and the DARPI and DOSA projects, through a combination of methodologies including design and digital anthropology, and design practices \(e.g. mapping and prototyping\). Major projects include: ‘Re\-envisioning Infection Practice Ecologies in Nursing’ \(RIPEN, AHRC\-funded; Co\-I: **Prendiville**\), working in dialogue with nurses to look at why, though Antimicrobial Resistance \(AMR\) impacts on nursing practices, it does not feature centrally or in the nursing curriculum. Working with Anne Marie Rafferty, President of the Royal College of Nursing, a RIPEN Policy Lab briefing with stakeholders with AMR\-related expertise mapped how to transform the research content into policy, this then given to the RCN’s Head of Infection, Protection and Control, and contributing to an RCN policy paper for UK government. The EU Horizon 2020 Pharma Factory project, a collaboration between five biotech SMEs and four academic institutions \(2017–2021, Co\-I: **Prendiville**\), is applying a user\-centred approach to engaging stakeholders \(industry, government, regulators, patient groups, clinicians and the public\) to understand better the opportunities for plant molecular pharmaceuticals. Work so far is highlighting the importance of different ways to communicate with different stakeholder audiences in contentious areas. In 2017, to support the take up of design within science and technology innovation, **Prendiville** produced *A scoping study: Design's Role in the Satellite Applications and Transportations Systems Catapults*, funded by the Knowledge Transfer Network. This work went on to support the adoption of design and human centred practices across the Catapults. \[5.6.\] 

 AMR is a global problem and RIPEN led to three Bhabha Newton\-funded research projects exploring AMR in India: DOSA \(Diagnostics for a One Health User\-Driven Solution in AMR \(Co\-I, **Prendiville**\) \[5.7.\] and DARPI \(Drivers of AMR in Poultry in India\). **Prendiville** is one of a small number of researchers working at the intersection between design, science and technology, bringing an anthropological approach to investigate the complexities of AMR. DARPI is interrogating the poultry supply chain, looking at how design can affect complex supply chains and local practices. Findings from DOSA were presented at a UK Parliamentary AMR event at the House of Commons \(February 2020\). 

 Since 2009, Ordnance Survey’s \(OS\) Geovation scheme, with **Prendiville** as a judge, has supported UK startups focused on building local resilience within communities against real problems that need collaboration and design thinking across all sectors of the economy \(public, private, civil society and individuals\). Grants of up to GBP20,000 have enabled a wide range of projects, with extensive national reach. \[5.8.\] [](https://geovation.uk/about/) 

 **Malpass** has made a significant contribution to the field of Critical Design Practice through research into its function to extend the disciplinary agency of industrial design, contributing to its establishment as a model at UAL. His 2013 paper was published as *Critical Design in Context: History, Theory and Practices* \(Bloomsbury, 2017\), translated into Japanese and Chinese \(2020, 6,723 copies sold at 31 December 2020\); second edition in development. **Malpass**’ work is widely regarded as the first text to develop a holistic view of the subject; the book is a key text in this growing field \(Bloomsbury Academic’s best\-selling design\-focused publication, 2017–2018\). The work is widely cited regularly in design literature, while **Malpass** contributes to public understanding of the subject beyond academia through mainstream and design media. \[5.9.\] He judged the Core 77 speculative concepts awards \(2016\), delivers talks to design agencies, lectures internationally \(A/D/O, New York, 2017\) and is on the editorial boards of *CoDesign: International Journal of Co\-Creation in Design and the Arts* and the *Journal of Engineering Design*. 

 In 2015, UAL invested in *Cultures of Resilience*, a two\-year project co\-created by DESIS Network founder/UAL Visiting Chair **Manzini** with Professor Jeremy Till, Head of Central Saint Martins. The work explored the cultural dimension of resilience with a specific focus on ‘place\-related’ communities, with an agenda to answer how creative collaborative practices can contribute to creating the conditions for meaningful encounters between people. This pan\-UAL project ensured the further development of social design work at the University. The results of this were reported on in a special issue of international journal *SheJi* \(Volume 4, Issue 1. Elsevier, 2018\) co\-edited by **Manzini** and **Thorpe.** \[5.10.\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at the Centre for Research in Environment and Health \(CREH\) at Aberystwyth University informed the implementation of recreational water quality standards, including revision of World Health Organisation \(WHO\) and European Union \(EU\) water quality guidelines and the Environment Agency’s \(UK\-wide\) Pollution Risk Forecasting system. Here, CREH provided, for the first time, real\-time and within\-day predictive modelling, facilitating pollution forecasts that have driven notification procedures and permitted user choice. This improved public safety and safeguarded Blue Flag status. CREH also served as technical adviser for the \(world\-wide\) Blue Flag Awards and for bathing water quality at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 535 words 

 Since 2000, the CREH at Aberystwyth University has developed new risk\-assessment methodology for bathing water exposures and implemented this at recreational bathing sites across Wales \[3.1; 3.2\]. 

 Article 14 of the Bathing Water Directive \(2006\) identified two science evidence requirements for the policy community: \(i\) additional epidemiological information covering both EU fresh recreational waters and Mediterranean bathing sites, and \(ii\) the use of viral pathogen enumeration as a regulatory tool for bathing waters. Two projects led by CREH addressed these priorities directly: Epibathe \(between 2005 and 2008\), generated additional epidemiological evidence from EU Mediterranean and riverine fresh water bathing sites \[3.6\], and Virobathe \(between 2005 and 2009\), investigated the use of viral pathogen enumeration as a regulatory tool \[3.7\]. 

 Subsequently, Viroclime \(between 2010 and 2013\), refined the viral enumeration methods and modelled the climate change impacts on pathogens in recreational waters in the EU and Brazil \[3.8\]. Cloud to Coast \(between 2011 and 2015\), developed an integrated model to predict the exposure to pathogen risks and their health impact assessment, in near\-shore coastal waters \[3.10\]. 

 As a further step, CREH undertook research to underpin the development of new health risk prediction modelling in the Smart Coasts project \(between 2010 and 2013\) \[3.9\]. This research integrated modelling of the catchment\-scale flux of pollutants from diffuse and point source inputs with detailed hydrodynamic instrumentation and modelling of near\-shore waters. This facilitated prediction modelling of health risk to operationalise the WHO and EU ‘predict and protect' approach to safe recreational water management, including developing a test site in Swansea Bay, an urban bathing water adjacent to Wales' second\-largest city.  This represented the first systematic examination and attempt to model significant within\-day variability \[3.3\] in microbial water quality observed at recreational beaches. The sampling underpinning the model development provided a unique granularity of data that suggested an alarming within\-day variability in health\-related bacterial compliance parameters \[3.4\]. Although widely considered an artefact of the complex pollution delivery system at Swansea, sampling proved that the 'compliance' outcome for this bathing water could be determined by the time of day chosen to take the sample \[3.4\]. The resulting modelling and notification system were implemented in 2013 \[3.5\] and informed WHO recommendations to the EU \[3.5\]. 

 Given the significant policy\-related findings of the Swansea Bay investigations EU Interreg funding of EUR5,100,000 was awarded to test the Swansea Bay findings at other 'at\-risk' bathing waters. Acclimatize \(between 2017 and 2023\) further developed and implemented the risk assessment methodology \[3.11\]. In 2017, the research focus turned to Cemaes Bay in Anglesey: a small rural bathing water dominated by livestock farming catchments with a small human population, served by a sewage treatment plant discharging a UV disinfected effluent. The daily variability at this rural bathing water was slightly larger than that observed in Swansea Bay, and this was true of other sites examined in 2018 \(two bathing waters in New Quay, Ceredigion, ‘New Quay North’ and ‘Traeth Gywn’ bathing waters\), and then \`Nolton Haven’, Pembrokeshire in 2019. The daily variance in water quality mirrored those of Swansea and Cemaes Bays, suggesting such high within\-day variability is characteristic of all UK bathing waters.

####  *Influencing International and UK public policy \- providing a scientific basis for recreational water quality standards* 

 CREH at Aberystwyth University influenced the revision of the WHO ‘Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments’. Kay was on the expert drafting group and Fewtrell managed the consultation process and first draft of the expert report agreed in October 2020 \[5.1\]. Kay and Fewtrell also advised on the revision of the EU Bathing Water Directive \(BWD\), BWD 2006/7/EU, which sets standards for EU bathing waters and was implemented in the 2015 bathing water season across more than 22,000 European beaches \[5.2; 5.3; 5.4\].  This benefited significantly the EU coastal tourism sector, which generates EUR183,000,000,000 of gross value added per annum \[5.5\]. The Lead Scientist directing the WHO Bathing Water Guidelines stated in 2018, that CREH are: 

 key members of the WHO technical advisory group on water quality. In this capacity, WHO has drawn on CREH experts to provide an updated review of evidence to inform revision of both EU BWD and WHO guidelines and also to provide rapid technical advice to Member States as needed. \[5.2\] 

 Kay was also recommended by the WHO as a technical adviser to Blue Flag International, the Foundation for Environmental Education \(FEE\) which administers the world\-wide Blue Flag Awards \(BFA\) for bathing waters. In this capacity Kay responded to multiple technical questions for FEE\-BFA \[5.6\]. A similar WHO recommendation led to Kay acting as the technical adviser on bathing water quality for relevant events at the 2016 Rio Olympics \[5.2\]. As the technical adviser Kay analysed, and reported the microbial water quality for recreational water events completed in nearshore waters off the beaches surrounding Rio to the organisers of the Rio Olympics and the WHO. 

 **Improving implementation of Environmental Policy: increasing compliance of recreational waters through predictive modelling and public notification of adverse water quality events** 

 Scientists from CREH oversaw the implementation of real\-time water quality predictive modelling and water management advisory notification approach in Swansea Bay \(between 2013 and 2020\) and Cemaes Bay, Anglesey, \(between 2018 and 2020\) \[5.7; 5.8; 5.9\]. Both of these sites were considered by local communities and experts as ‘at risk’ of failing EU standards and of de\-designation as bathing beaches. GPB100,000,000 of water company investment over many years had not improved Swansea Bay's 'at\-risk' classification, and Cemaes Bay failed EU water quality tests in 2016 and 2017. Following the implementation of CREH’s water quality modelling, prediction and notification system, both Swansea Bay and Cemaes Bay passed EU water quality standards and the latter achieved a ‘Good’ EU classification in 2020. This also protected and enhanced public health as bathers were told in real\-time when recreational waters were safe to use, allowing them ’informed choice’ as recommended in WHO Guidelines published in 2003 and 2020 \(draft\), and EU regulations published in 2006 and 2018. 

 The CREH team worked with Anglesey County Council’s task group and Environmental Health Team to support water quality management at Cemaes Bay from 2017. As the Isle of Anglesey County Chief Executive noted in 2018: 

 I would like to record my appreciation for your lead and the work you have undertaken with Dr Mark Wyer and your team during 2017, that led to the development of the Bathing Water Prediction Model, which was used successfully during this year’s bathing water season. 

 Your involvement with the task group, and continued commitment to provide representation and input in this matter has been invaluable to the Council, and the assistance and support provided to the members of staff from the Environmental Health team when issues have arisen has been greatly appreciated by them. \[5.8\] 

 CREH’s predictive modelling was also adopted by the Environment Agency \(EA\) and other regulatory agencies to model bathing water microbial dynamics and associated health risk.  In 2016, the Environment Agency \(EA\) Science Lead in this area explained the importance of Aberystwyth University’s predictive modelling on UK regulatory pollution forecasts: 

 I regularly highlight the Smart Coasts Project report to colleagues working in other regulatory Agencies and the policy community … to shape their understanding of bathing water dynamics and what can be done to model them in an effective way. \[5.9\] 

 The EA has used CREH’s multiple regression approach for water quality prediction since 2014 to underpin its Pollution Risk Forecasting \(PRF\) system at more than 150 bathing waters across the UK \[5.9\], supporting the Bathing Water Directives short\-term pollution provision and warning bathers when water quality standards may not be met, and thereby protecting a bathing site’s classification: 

 In 2015, using the PRF system, over 23,000 bathing water quality forecasts were made of which approximately 2,400 were warnings. From this, 65 bathing waters had their classification protected … including 23 sites that would have a deterioration of class... \[5.9\] 

 For the WHO Lead Scientist in this area: 

 A particularly novel aspect of WHO Guidelines \(2003\) and the EU Bathing Water Directive \(2006\) is the option for regulators to implement real\-time prediction of water quality. This is of particular public health benefit because it provides regulators with the option to deliver 'informed choice' to potential bathing water users considering visiting a public bathing water. Development in this area draw on the pioneering work of CREH as reported in the peer reviewed literature \(Water Research 2018\), the Smart Coasts and Acclimatize project and operational models in daily use in Swansea and Cemaes Bays led by CREH. \[5.2\] 

 CREH’s work safeguarded public health and the economies of communities based on tourism \[5.10\] which ‘contributes £4 billion pounds to the UK economy’ \[5.11\], as bathers are now told in real\-time when recreational waters are safe to use, allowing them ’informed choice’ as recommended in WHO Guidelines published in 2003 and 2020. Previous models, applied world\-wide, use the bathing day as the unit of prediction which incorrectly assumes within\-day uniformity in bacterial concentration. AU's predictive modelling produces more accurate water quality predictions. This approach also informed the modelling adopted by the Environment Agency \(EA\) and other regulatory agencies to model bathing water microbial dynamics and associated health risk \[5.9\].

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Centre for Electronic Imaging \(CEI\), a collaboration between The Open University and Teledyne e2v \(Te2v\), is dedicated to the research and development of advanced image sensor technologies. Led by Professor Andrew **Holland**, the CEI has over 30 academics, researchers and PhD students. Since its formation in 2004, CEI members have contributed to over 14 international space missions led by European, US and Indian agencies. 

 Our fundamental semiconductor research has led to improvements in device design and the development of new analysis methods for in\-flight and laboratory use. In 2014, a **new technique called ‘trap pumping’** was developed **\[O1\]** for characterisation of defects in silicon caused by spaceborne radiation. Trap pumping has orders of magnitude greater sensitivity in defect identification than previous methods and provides a **step change in the understanding of radiation damage effects**. This knowledge was used to optimise the operation and the working temperature of the imagers and has led to key developments in the applications of Charged Coupled Devices \(CCDs\) for space\-based imaging **\[O2\]**, including the development of radiation hard p\-channel CCDs **\[O3\]**. 

 Since 2013, we have been developing soft\-X ray imaging systems and analysis software that improve the energy and the spatial resolution of Electron Multiplying CCDs \(EMCCDs\), opening up new applications in synchrotron imaging **\[O4\]**. Following this research, we demonstrated excellent **single\-photon\-counting performance in electron multiplying CCDs** \(EMCCD\) after irradiation equivalent to that experienced in\-flight. Subsequently, through further device design and simulation, we showed for the first time that CEI\-modified Te2v **EMCCDs are suitable for space\-based astronomy**. 

 The CEI demonstrated a new charge transport channel and output in CCDs with a factor of 4 improvement in radiation hardness and much reduced readout noise. Coupled with optimisation of the operating conditions, we showed that the **X\-ray detection threshold can be improved** from 2,000 eV to below 300 eV in a large area CCD, even at the expected end\-of\-life irradiation dose in a space environment. 

 Further expanding our sensor and radiation damage expertise, we formed a new research team on complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor \(CMOS\) image sensor development. With UKSA funding, the CMOS research team was able to **qualify the Te2v CIS115 sensor** for the harsh radiation environment that will be experienced by ESA’s JUICE spacecraft around Jupiter and its moons. Furthermore, the team has optimised the linearity and image lag behaviour of CIS115 **\[O5\]**, leading to better performance of the flight camera. 

 Working under a grant jointly awarded to the CEI and Te2v during 2012\-2015, the CMOS research team was tasked with addressing several challenges in image sensor technology. The most pressing of these was increasing the sensitivity to near\-infrared \(NIR\) light of silicon devices based on the ubiquitous pinned photodiode photosensitive element. Simulation work yielded a novel pixel design, subsequently called ‘HiRho CMOS’, for which a **patent application was granted** **\[O6\]**. The new pixel delivers **an order of magnitude higher NIR quantum efficiency** than CMOS image sensors available in 2020 and was experimentally proven in 2016 in a project funded by the UK Space Agency **\[O7\]**. This invention also allows CMOS image sensors to be adopted as soft X\-ray detectors due to the much thicker sensitive detector volume, marking another milestone in the adoption of CMOS technology over the previously preferred CCD. Presently, a sensor based on this patent is being developed by us for the forthcoming THESEUS X\-ray space telescope led by ESA.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our ground\-breaking research in CCDs and CMOS image sensors has led to benefits for industry and space agencies. Impacts in the area of **commerce and the economy** include increased sales, new and improved products, and protected jobs for a range of beneficiaries, including a large UK\-based multinational \(Teledyne e2v\), its subsidiary \(Teledyne AnaFocus\), ESA and a SME \(XCAM Ltd.\). The improved performance of our novel, patented technology has also created opportunities beyond space, in Medical and Scientific imaging. 

 **Impact on Teledyne e2v** 

 Our strategic collaboration with Te2v over the last 16 years \(12 years at the OU\), as well as our close working relationships with the Space Agencies, who are a core market for Te2v products, have been our primary **pathways to impact.** This is confirmed by the comments of the Te2v President \(Space & Quantum\) and Site Director at Chelmsford, who says: 

 ""*The \[CEI\-Te2v\] collaboration brings both parties increased academic and commercial success, with the CEI producing key IP for future projects and being involved with over GBP4M of Teledyne e2v customer contracts in the past 12 months alone*"" **\[C1\]**. 

 The Chief Engineer of Te2v explains: 

 *“Teledyne e2v is a world\-leading manufacturer of CCD and CMOS image sensors for science and space applications. Our high\-performance devices have been deployed in a large number of ground and space\-based telescopes such as Hubble, VLT and Gaia, and also in numerous space probes by ESA and NASA, such as New Horizons. Our image sensor sales are almost exclusively for export and \[text removed for publication\] we employ around 250 staff in the UK. Understanding radiation damage effects in CCDs and CMOS image sensors is very important to our business. The research conducted by the CEI has been crucial in mitigating the radiation damage effects in CCDs for many space\-based imaging instruments*” **\[C2\]**. 

 CEI’s research **\[O1\]** has greatly improved the radiation resistance of CCDs used in major ESA and NASA space missions such as Euclid, SMILE and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope \(formerly WFIRST\). Our research has improved the performance of CCD technology through design and optimisation **\[O2\]**, so that the science requirements of the missions can be met. By demonstrating this, the sensors were adopted for the missions, resulting in major contracts for CCD manufacture to Te2v. The Chief Engineer continues: 

 “*The CEI\-Te2v collaboration has been crucial to demonstrate that CCDs are suitable for the Euclid, SMILE, and WFIRST space missions. This has helped us secure contracts for CCD manufacture \[text removed for publication\] \[during the period 2013\-2020\] supporting a significant fraction of the jobs at our plant in Chelmsford*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Our work on CMOS imaging technology started much later than that on CCDs, but the impact is increasing rapidly and is on track to prove equally significant. Following the radiation characterisation and optimisation conducted at the CEI, the Te2v\-made CIS115 has been adopted into ESA’s billion\-euro JUICE mission to Jupiter \[text removed for publication\] **\[C3**, p.1 **\]**. JUICE makes full use of the excellent radiation performance of CIS115 **\[O4\]** and its higher operating temperature. This allows the spacecraft to be lighter and survive longer in the harsh radiation environment in orbit around Jupiter for greater scientific return. Our research has been crucial for the selection of CIS115 and for the achievement of the mission’s planned objectives. 

 CIS115 has now been adopted by several future space missions, such as ALTIUS \(funded by the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy \[text removed for publication\]\), and for an instrument on the future Comet Interceptor spacecraft. Due to extensive characterisation and optimisation conducted at the CEI, the CIS115 sensor is now being offered by Te2v as a fully space\-qualified product **\[C4\]**. 

 Using a patent **\[O6\]** generated by the CEI, Te2v has developed a new product line of CMOS image sensors with ten\-fold increase in their near\-infrared quantum efficiency, aimed at the scientific and space markets. The Chief Engineer at Te2v testifies: 

 “*The IP in CMOS image sensors generated by the CEI is now being used to develop two new image sensor families at Te2v. The first one to be launched is the HiRho fully depleted sensor with enhanced near\-infrared sensitivity, based on a patented invention at the CEI. We have already received \[text removed for publication\] contracts from ESA with a follow\-on contract expected soon for the development of these sensors for space\-based imaging. Over the last few years we have been observing an increased demand for CMOS imagers with high quantum efficiency at visible and near\-infrared wavelengths for various applications, including astronomy and adaptive optics, but also for hyperspectral imaging from space, microscopy, spectroscopy and surveillance. The development of such high QE devices will help strengthen our market position*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Teledyne AnaFocus has also developed a new product based on the same patent **\[O6\]**, aimed at industrial time\-of\-flight and machine vision applications. The VP and General Manager of Teledyne e2v and Teledyne AnaFocus comments: 

 “*By using the HiRho patented technology invented at Open University **\[O6\]**, we have developed a new Time\-of\-Flight CMOS image sensor with much increased near\-infrared sensitivity \[…\]\[text removed for publication\]we have also established a dedicated team \[…\] and created 15 new jobs. Furthermore, Teledyne e2v has started two new projects in Medical and Scientific imaging with HiRho technology, which will allow both new products to benefit from this invention and achieve outstanding performance*” **\[C5\]**. 

 **Impact on XCAM** 

 XCAM is an SME based in Northampton that specialises in providing innovative CCD and CMOS\-based solutions for challenging imaging applications **\[C6\]**. Long\-term collaboration between the CEI and XCAM has helped develop expertise in complete camera systems, with demonstrated history in vacuum\-compatible applications and large\-area, multi detector solutions. XCAM’s CEO states: 

 “*Through collaboration agreements with the Centre for Electronic Imaging \(CEI\), we have worked together to apply their research outputs \(e.g. Soman et al. \(2013\) NIM\-A, vol. 731 pp 47\-52\) **\[O4\]** into next\-generation X\-ray cameras designed for the Resonant Inelastic X\-ray Scattering technique at synchrotron facilities*” **\[C6\]**. 

 \[Text removed for publication.\] 

 **Impact on ESA and the UK Space Agency** 

 The European Space Agency \(ESA\) is tasked with delivering space capability to its 22 member states, with much of the UK’s role directed by the UK Space Agency \(UKSA\). ESA and the UKSA conduct space exploration, earth observation and technology development for the benefit of the citizens of Europe and the world. 

 Cryogenic irradiation and trap pumping, two of the new research methods developed and championed by the CEI **\[O1\]**, have helped reduce the radiation damage effects in CCDs and have increased the performance of the Euclid VIS instrument. This is equivalent to increasing the lifetime of this EUR600,000,000 space telescope by 20% \(an additional year\) **\[O2\]**, with the corresponding greater scientific return. Without our radiation damage research Euclid would not have been selected by ESA, and no contracts for CCD manufacture would have been placed. UKSA’s Director of Programmes states: 

 “*New techniques developed and demonstrated by the CEI \[…\] have had a dramatic improvement on the understanding of radiation damage in silicon with subsequent impact to many space missions using CCDs*” **\[C7\]**. 

 UKSA’s Director of Programmes continues: 

 “*Furthermore, CEI research on Teledyne e2v’s p\-channel CCDs has firmly established that p\-channel CCD technology can offer better radiation hardness than the usual n\-channel CCDs. The results of their initial study **\[O3\]** generated great interest in the technology and led to the production of a new device based on the results of the initial research by the CEI*” **\[C7\]**. 

 Our research into p\-channel CCDs resulted in two follow\-on contracts between ESA and the Open University \[text removed for publication\] **\[C1\]**. Our research into soft X\-ray detection by CCDs **\[O4\]** enabled the required science performance for the SMILE mission to be met and this joint European\-Chinese satellite to go ahead. Modified Te2v EMCCDs are now \(2020\) in production for NASA’s Roman Space Telescope, the first use of this technology in space\-based astronomy. The new devices are being tested in the CEI laboratories in collaboration with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 An estimated 2.1 million children within the EU are separated from a parent because the adult is incarcerated. The COPING project – a Pan\-European study led by the University of Huddersfield – has shown these children are exposed to triple jeopardy through break\-up of the family, financial hardship and extremes of stigma and secrecy. For many, this has led to adverse social, emotional and educational outcomes. COPING has influenced new developments in policy and practice globally in order to tackle this adversity. This included policy at the UN Human Rights Council and Crime Commission, UNICEF and the Council of Europe, both directly and via NGOs. COPING was also the basis for training of charities, police and the judiciary in Romania, Uganda and the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 An estimated 2.1 million children within the EU are separated from a parent who is incarcerated; sometimes both parents are in prison. The COPING project was initiated within a policy context in which these children were marginalised and largely invisible and, in the first Pan\-European study, studied the effects on them of parental imprisonment.  It took a child\-centred approach and focused on their mental health and resilience. 

 The research was led by Professor Adele Jones, Professor of Social Work \(since 2007\) and University of Huddersfield colleagues: Dr Bernard Gallagher, Reader in Social Work \(2007–2020\), and Kathryn Sharratt, Senior Lecturer in Criminology \(since 2009\). The EU\-FP7 funded project \(2009–2012\) comprised a multidisciplinary consortium of 10 NGO and research partners from six countries with expertise in child and adolescent mental health, psychology, social work, criminology, human rights and sociology. 

 Four countries \(Germany, Sweden, Romania and the UK\) were chosen for the research to ensure a diversity of penal and child welfare systems and to reflect variation in imprisonment policy and practice. For example, the UK had the fastest growing prison population while Sweden had fewer prisoners relative to population size, and shorter sentences. There were a number of interrelated elements to the study: 

-  A self\-reporting survey of 730 children and parents which investigated coping strategies and mental health problems. 

-  In\-depth follow up interviews, conducted across Germany, Sweden, Romania and the UK, with a representative subset of 349 children and parents. 

-  A systematic mapping of interventions across partner countries. 

-  An analysis to integrate the findings and extract need dimensions, which were compared with a theoretical framework. 

-  Stakeholder consultation, including face\-to\-face interviews, focus groups, telephone interviews and an on\-line questionnaire, with 122 professionals and groups. These included: care\-givers; residential care staff; social workers; prison staff; NGO staff; children of prisoners; imprisoned parents; government and NGO staff involved in policy; and school\-related stakeholders. 

-  A public engagement and dissemination strategy to provide a vehicle for the release of emerging findings. 

 The findings indicated that the children of parents who are in prison were exposed to triple jeopardy through break\-up of the family, financial hardship and extremes of stigma and secrecy, which led, for many, to adverse social, emotional and educational outcomes. It identified that the children were likely to need extensive support and that they had additional needs compared to other children, such as ambiguous loss and disrupted attachment \[3.1\]. 

 Gender differences were identified. Girls seemed at particular risk of internalising difficulties \(emotional problems\), while boys were more likely to externalise them, leading to behavioural and conduct problems. Key factors relating to children's resilience included: children's innate qualities; the importance of family stability; and sustaining relationships with the imprisoned parent. The data indicated that children's resilience was closely linked to open communication especially around the imprisonment and that children needed opportunities to discuss their experiences. 

 The children were found to be at significantly greater risk of mental health problems than their peers in the general population. Twenty five percent were at high risk of mental health problems, rising to near 50% of children in Romania. The support of a care\-giving parent and extended family was central to good mental health and resilience, while schools played a key role, functioning as a major source of stability at a time of upheaval and disruption. 

 Generally, children did better if they were able to maintain good quality contact with the imprisoned parent \[3.1,3.2\]. Appropriately equipped child\-centred visiting and regular, easily accessed contact which maintained the child–parent relationship were identified as essential for children’s well\-being. Maternal imprisonment often resulted in insecure care arrangements and increased financial hardship for the child. Paternal imprisonment often meant a child lost contact with their father even though our results indicated the father–child relationship was equally important. 

 COPING highlighted that mainstream child and adolescent mental health services had little understanding of the needs of these children, and in all countries the study found a lack of cooperation between criminal justice and child welfare agencies \[3.1\]. Most agency support for these children was provided via NGOs. Specialist services were scarce and, within Romania, non\-existent. In an attempt to improve this, a set of 12 comprehensive recommendations were drawn from the research. They focused on establishing child\-sensitive justice systems with actions for the judiciary, governments, the police, social services, NGOs and prisons \[3.1,3.3\]. 

 The project undertook more than 150 public engagement and dissemination activities across Europe. These enabled the Huddersfield team and their partners to directly influence stakeholders at the global \(UN\), transnational \(EU\) and national level. The ‘end\-of\-project’ conference \(2012\) was held in Brussels, with an audience of EU parliamentarians. It prepared the ground for the impacts described in this case study, and featured an address by Baroness Hale of Richmond, who said “ *The important lesson to emerge with the COPING research is that everyone who plays a part \[..\] needs to recognize the needs of these children and make proper provision for them. This research is vital to introducing these matters to the wider policy agenda*.” A Senior Policy Adviser at UNICEF Brussels, said: “ *The research has made the invisible children visible*.”

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research findings and the recommendations of the COPING project have shaped policy, legislation, practice, organisational structures, attitudes, and political thinking at the international, national and regional levels in government, NGOs, the police and judiciary. 

 Regarding impact, the project has: 

1.  Informed national, European and international policy leading to increased awareness and advocacy 

1.  Enabled training and capacity building 

1.  Underpinned improvements in services and practices 

 **Informed national, European and international policy leading to increased awareness and advocacy** 

 The COPING project has enabled and informed policy impacts within the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN Crime Commission and Congress. COPING partner, the Quaker United Nations Office \(QUNO\), ensured that the issues covered by the research were relevant to stakeholders in the UN, and provided a direct route for communicating the project findings and recommendations. 

 In Scotland, the Support for Children \(Impact of Parental Imprisonment\) Bill \(2015\) used the COPING findings as a primary source of research\-based evidence \[5.1\]. In Italy, a Memorandum of Understanding, signed in 2014 and extended in 2016, outlined the measures to be taken in order to protect and respond to the rights and needs of \[the\] children of prisoners \[5.2\]. 

 The Deputy Children’s Ombudsman of the Council of Europe said \(2020\): *“the findings of the COPING research were particularly helpful to me in developing the Council of Europe Strategy for the Rights of the Child \(2016\-2021\)*” \[5.3\]. The research was invaluable in furthering Children of Prisoners in Europe \(COPE\)’s advocacy around the importance of the relationship between a child and their imprisoned parent and the need for a multidisciplinary approach *.* The Executive Director of COPE wrote in 2019, *“the research paved the way towards the Council of Europe \[recommendation\] concerning children with imprisoned parents, which offer the first prison\-based guidance focusing specifically on the rights of children”* \[5.4\]. 

 **Enabled training and capacity building** 

 The COPING dissemination strategy helped raise awareness with relevant NGOs. COPING partner, Alternative Sociale, became the first NGO in Romania to focus on the needs of children of prisoners due to their involvement in the project. Between 2013 and 2015, they trained professionals on the needs of children of prisoners and in 2016 ran a special educational project in Iaşi to support children separated from parents as a consequence of detention. Alternative Sociale used the COPING results as a catalyst to transform the visiting rooms in Iași and Vaslui Penitentiaries so that they are child\-friendly, alleviating the traumatic experience of seeing the parent again in a detention space. This led to a Civil Society award from the Romanian Government \[5.5\]. 

 In the UK, from December 2018 to December 2019, associated with their national information centre on children of offenders \(i\-HOP\), Barnardo’s used the COPING evidence to develop and implement a toolkit in schools in South Wales \[5.6\]. 

 In Uganda, the research has been the source of training materials for study weeks \(throughout the assessment period\) by Wells of Hope, which cares for children whose parents are on death row, serving a long sentence, or living with HIV while imprisoned. The Founder of Wells of Hope charity explained: *“…the COPING research influences, validates and informs our work because it highlighted the potential for schools to contribute to the emotional wellbeing of children with imprisoned parents…the COPING research forms a core text in our studies”* \[5.7\]. 

 **Underpinned improvements in services and practices** 

 COPING results have led to numerous improvements and developments in practice. In the UK Barnardo’s developed a toolkit \(referencing the research\) for agencies to support children of prisoners and to tackle the stigma they face. The toolkit was used by COPING partner Partners of Prisoner Support \(POPS\) to train over 3,500 professionals between 2013 and 2016. As a result of the research, POPS has transformed its services by incorporating the views of children and shifting the focus away from the partners of prisoners and onto children themselves, and in turn has produced briefings for the police, schools and prisons \[5.8\]. 

 As a result of the research, police in Bavaria adopted a more family\-friendly approach when carrying out arrests by providing information on sources of support for families. The Ministries of Justice in the German Federal States of Nordrhein\-Westfalen and Schleswig\-Holstein initiated support programmes for children of prisoners in light of the findings from COPING, and the State of Nordrhein\-Westfalen has created family support centres in five prisons \(from 2020\). Treffpunkt e.V., the COPING NGO partner in Germany, initiated a project to train professionals on how to engage with children of prisoners and launched a website providing information on services for children of detainees from all over Germany. Written evidence from Treffpunkt e.V. highlights the key contribution of COPING to their work with children: *“Our project of outreach work was only established on the basis of the Coping Study and the associated legal regulations in the State Prison Law. Previously, there was no corresponding support process that included the children of prisoners as a separate target group defined by specific problems”* \[5.9\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Beard’s research into the uses of the classical tradition in contemporary cultural and political debates, and the role of women in antiquity and the modern world, undertaken at the University of Cambridge, has been particularly important in uncovering the classical origins of contemporary assumptions about women’s power and voice. Her *Women and Power* has inspired political leaders and policy\-makers worldwide, from UN Secretary General, António Guterres, to Hillary Clinton, to think differently about issues of gender, speech and power. Her presentations at, e.g., the Foreign Office, British embassies and the World Economic Forum have brought enriched historical understanding into equal opportunity and leadership debates. Her work lies behind a London fashion collection, an album track by award\-winning US rap artist, Janelle Monáe, as well as changing the lives and aspirations of many people internationally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Beard’s research explores the complex ways in which the modern world is still – for better or worse – the inheritor of the traditions and debates of antiquity. Within this general theme, she has investigated in detail the relationship between the ideology of gender in antiquity and today. How does gender inflect our understanding of the classical world? What has been the role of women in contemporary classical scholarship? How far are modern assumptions about the place of women in \(or out of\) the public sphere still the legacy of Greco\-Roman theories and assumptions? 

 The interplay between ancient and modern is one important focus of her *SPQR*  \(2015\) **\[R1\],** a radical new history of Rome, which rejects the popular idea that Rome’s history can be *directly* relevant to modern political problems \(there is no simplistic comparison here between US presidents and Roman emperors\), and instead stresses the complex intersection between ancient and modern debates. Chapter 1, e.g., examines the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BCE in the light of more recent controversies over civil liberties, while also tracing how it is that Cicero’s slogans from 63 are still plastered on banners in modern political protests. Throughout, the book focuses on Roman conceptions of cultural identity, on their mythical origins as refugees and asylum seekers, and on their characteristic practice of extending Roman citizenship, eventually to all free inhabitants in the empire. It prompts us to consider the contrast with modern nation states’ assumptions about citizenship and migration. 

 Much of Beard’s research concerns the use of Classics in modern culture \(notably in *Confronting the Classics* \(2013\) **\[R2\]**, and ‘Live Classics’ \(2011\) **\[R3\]**, which focuses on Tony Harrison’s play *Fram*\). One main research theme has also been the theory and practice of gender in the classical world and classical scholarship. *Classical Art* \(2001\) **\[R4\]** contains a groundbreaking discussion of the ancient female nude. Even more notably, *The Invention of Jane Harrison* \(2000\) **\[R5\]** examines one of the earliest professional women classicists in the UK, and still one of the most influential, to consider the conditions under which a ‘biography’ \(in conventional terms\) of such a figure is possible, and to explore the ways in which Harrison *both* found a public voice, *and* was silenced and sometimes ridiculed. 

 Beard brought these themes together in *Women and Power* \(2017\) \[ **R6**\]. Originating in two lectures given at the British Museum, this book, intended for a wide audience, is driven by years of classical and historical research. It exposes the origins in classical antiquity of many contemporary assumptions about the power and voice \(or powerlessness and silence\) of women – starting from the presentation \(and silencing\) of Penelope in the *Odyssey*, through the mutilation of the tongue of Philomela, to the satiric attacks on modern female politicians worldwide as new ‘Medusas’. The achievement of the book is to use the classical world as a lens through which to examine modern structures and images of power, still largely coded as male. It is a rare and innovatory attempt to historicise contemporary issues of gender.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research impacts on three areas: 

 **\(1\)** on political and policy forums; **\(2\)** on changing people’s lives, assumptions and aspirations; **\(3\)** on art and cultural production. 

 **\(1\) Political and policy forums** 

 *Women and Power* \[text removed for publication\] has demonstrated to world leaders, debating policy on gender equality worldwide, just how ancient are the structures that silence women. António Guterres praised its explanation of ‘deep power imbalances today’ in his opening speech at the 63<sup>rd</sup> Session of the UN Commission on the status of Women **\[E1\]**; Hillary Clinton has often drawn on the analysis of *Women and Power*, e.g., on Instagram \(“Historian Mary Beard opened doors to our past and future that were once closed”\), in an interview on BBC1’s, *The One Show* and in her *Book of Gutsy Women*: “When I had the opportunity to sit down with her on a visit to London in 2017, I refrained from reading back at her every line that had resonated with me, since we would have been there all day.” **\[E2\]**; and it was cited in the UK parliament to support reform of the “pairing” system, and in the Scottish parliament in support of women’s rights **\[E3\]**. 

 Beard herself has presented the book’s themes at numerous events organised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, prompting the rethinking of gender in the diplomatic service – including the annual leadership conference for all UK ambassadors in 2019, and events at UK embassies in Paris, Rabat and Rome. In 2018 Permanent Under\-Secretary, Simon McDonald, acknowledged Beard’s inspiration in devising the FCO’s wall of mirrors representing senior positions never held by women **\[E4, E5\]**. She has also inspired constructive re\-examination of women’s public voice by speaking at political events: the Festival of Politics in the Scottish Parliament \(2018\), the International Congress of Women’s Parliamentary Caucuses \(Dublin, 2018\); the Italian House of Representatives \(2017\) and the European Commission’s Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights. In 2020 she led a discussion based on *Women and Power* at the World Economic Forum at Davos. Outside politics, she has brought these ideas into a business context, addressing the ‘Flagship Seminar’ of the Bank of England and, with Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the Google Zeitgeist annual forum for senior Google executives **\[E6\]**. 

 *SPQR* has also played a significant part in public debate, putting ancient history back at its centre. At another event at Davos 2020, with a group of world business leaders, Beard discussed the role of ancient history in modern politics, and *SPQR* has informed political commentary in the USA, by liberals and conservatives alike \(e.g., a major article in the Washington Post questioning the parallels between the fall of Rome and the possible fall of the US, and articles on topics ranging from Google’s empire to the US Supreme Court **\[E7\]**. In 2016 Beard debated the “virtues” of ancient Greece and Rome with Boris Johnson, putting antiquity at the heart of political argument \(the official YouTube video of this has been watched over 885,000 times\) **\[E7\]**. 

 **\(2\) Changing lives, assumptions and aspirations** 

 *SPQR* and *Women and Power* have both figured on prominent lists of best books of the year; *SPQR* was World Economic Forum Book Club’s book of the Month \(July 2019\). and listed as current reading by Booker Prize Winner, Marlon James \(2015\), UK Health Minister, then Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock \(2018\), and CEO of Agence France Presse, Fabrice Fries \(2018\). *Women and Power* figured in the *Guardian*’s 100 best books of the 21<sup>st</sup> century  and as a “book of the year” internationally from Italy and Germany to Spain and Venezuela ; it was the current reading of Nicola Sturgeon \(2018\), recommended by Melissa Benn for Theresa May \(“I can’t believe someone didn’t slip it into her Christmas stocking”\), and underpinned Helen McGrady’s reforms at the National Trust **\[E8\]**. 

 *Women and Power* has played an important part in different initiatives on equality and diversity, in the widest sense. In 2019 it was the book for Indiana University Northwest’s “One Book… One Campus… One Community’ initiative” \(“integrated into classroom curricula, and explored on campus and in the community through discussions, film screenings, and other public events”\); in 2019 it was given to all \(more than 500\) first\-year students in the Faculties of Arts and Philosophy at Radboud University, Nijmegen \(with whom Beard debated\) \[ **E9**\]. But the reach of the book goes further: from Beard’s address to the International “Inspiring Girls” conference in London \(2019\) \[ **E5\]**, through heritage projects at Hardwick Hall and the National Maritime Museum exploring how the historical voice of women has been heard or silenced \(a visitor’s blog post shows that the link was understood\) **\[E9\],** to attested success in changing individuals’ lives \(“I will not allow my thoughts to go unheard. I owe that in large part to you”\) in an email from Germany headed “Thank you for giving me my voice back”; “ *Women and Power* gave me the strength to fight for State Pension justice” \(claimed one tweet\) **\[E10\]**. 

 **\(3\) Impact on the creative industries** 

 *Women and Power* informed Juliet Stevenson’s West End theatre portrayal of Elizabeth I and Mary Stuart, provided fashion designer Edeline Lee’s theme for her Autumn/Winter 2019 collection \(with quotes from the book played at the catwalk show\), and inspired “Crazy, Classic, Life” on Janelle Monáe’s 2018 album, Dirty Computer \(referencing, in particular, the cultural intolerance of women who “fail”\) **\[E11\]**. These appropriations of *Woman and Power* in fashion and rap have provided an even wider and more diverse audience with a classical lens through which to understand and interrogate the contemporary world.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 As exemplified by the current COVID\-19 global pandemic, the health and economic consequences of spill\-overs of wildlife diseases into human populations can be devastating. Research carried out by scientists at the University College London \(UCL\) and the Institute of Zoology \(IoZ\) has improved the understanding of how ecological, epidemiological and socioeconomic factors interact to drive spill\-overs of these ‘zoonotic’ diseases into humans. The research has informed global zoonotic disease research funding priorities, for example guiding wildlife disease surveillance efforts \(USAID’s PREDICT programme\); international policy priorities through the United Nations \(UN\), Intergovernmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services \(IPBES\), and World Wide Fund for Nature \(WWF\); and public health responses to disease outbreaks through the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office \(FCDO\), as well as improving public understanding of links between the extinction and climate crises on zoonotic disease spill\-over risk. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Animal\-borne \(zoonotic\) diseases are a major global human health and economic burden but, for many diseases, little is known about the underlying drivers of spill\-overs, severely hindering effective public health responses to prevent and manage future outbreaks. UCL and IoZ researchers have made seminal contributions to understand zoonotic spill\-over risk by identifying and quantifying what drives transfer of diseases from wildlife to people, predicting emerging disease hotspots, and developing a unifying interdisciplinary framework to inform disease management in a changing world. 

 **Drivers of zoonotic spill\-over and identification of disease hotspots** 

 In 2000, IoZ research \(undertaken by Cunningham, now a professor at IoZ\) co\-developed a new paradigm for the links between ecology and human health in a seminal synthesis where infectious agents \(or pathogens\) harboured by wildlife were highlighted as the source of a series of high\-impact, human diseases \(zoonoses\), for example Ebola, Nipah and HIV/AIDS \[R1\]. The synthesis identified that the emergence of these diseases was driven by human activities, such as changes in hunting practices, encroachment into remaining wildlife habitats and a growing international trade in wildlife. This paper provided a scientific rationale for what is now known as ‘One Health’ – an approach to designing and implementing programmes, policies, legislation and research in which multiple sectors communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes. At IoZ, this idea was further developed by Jones in 2008 \(first funded by a UKRI research fellowship at IoZ from 2005 to 2012 and now a professor at UCL\), with the first quantitative analysis of global patterns of human disease emergence \[R2\]. This research demonstrated that the rate of disease emergence was increasing, that the majority of human infectious diseases were from wildlife, and that areas of high biodiversity and increased human population densities correlated with past emergence of zoonotic disease \[R2\]. Additionally, Jones’ analyses identified ‘emerging disease hotspots’: regions where new emerging infectious diseases are most likely to originate. Jones concluded that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort currently focussed on countries where the next important emerging infectious disease is least likely to originate. Synthesising these global results with existing experimental studies in 2010 \[R3\], Jones importantly highlighted growing evidence of the negative impact of the Anthropocene on infectious disease risk through biodiversity loss. 

 **Preventing and managing disease spill\-overs in a changing world** 

 In 2012, a joint IoZ\-UCL NERC\-funded research project within the Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation \(ESPA\) programme, Jones and Cunningham \(also funded by the Royal Society\) co\-led the development of a novel framework to operationalise the ecological, social and economic conditions that facilitate zoonotic disease emergence and transmission. This framework would inform appropriate interdisciplinary responses for prevention and management of such diseases \[R4\]. This holistic, interdisciplinary framework which put into operation the ‘One Health’ approach, brought together natural and social sciences perspectives to provide an effective framework for understanding the management and mitigation of the risks of emerging infectious diseases. This framework was used in research led by Redding \(from 2012 to 2020, initially as a PDRA at UCL on the NERC project and then funded from a MRC research fellowship, and subsequently on a Sir Henry Dale Royal Society fellowship at IoZ from 2020 onwards\), and supported by Jones and Cunningham \(funded by MRC GCRF and EC FP7\). Their research quantified how socio\-ecological changes in biodiversity, habitat, land use, poverty and climate affect risk of animal\-to\-human disease spill\-over in a number of high impact disease systems, such as Lassa fever \[R5\] and Ebola \[R6\]. These disease\-forecasting models have improved knowledge of how spill\-over dynamics are affected by present and future global changes, such as climate, land use and urbanisation.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact of research from UCL and IoZ  falls into three main areas: informing zoonotic disease research funding; influencing international policy priorities and public health responses to disease outbreaks; and improving public understanding of links between environmental change and zoonotic disease spill\-over risk. As evidenced by communication from the Wellcome’s Director: “ *This research has had a global impact over many years, events of the last twelve months have underlined just how critical it is to all our health here in the UK, in so many countries around the world and to global health security*” \[S1\]. 

 **Informing research funding priorities for zoonotic diseases** 

 UCL and IoZ research has informed funding priorities both internationally and nationally. Some key examples include: 

 Emerging disease hotspots information: \[R2\] was used as the basis for the geographical targeting of the US Government’s international aid to countries at high risk of emerging diseases. From 2008 to 2019, approximately USD1.5 billion was spent through USAID’s Emerging Pandemic Threats program, including the PREPARE, IDENTIFY, PREDICT, RESPOND, and One Health Workforce programmes. As evidenced by the Director of EcoHealth Alliance, a key partner in PREDICT: “ *The maps from this paper …remain a central core of the geographic targeting for all USAID pandemic prevention work to date*” \[S2\]. 

 Key evidence from \[R2\] also contributed to the DFID \(now Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office\) scoping report in 2012 on the links between zoonotic disease emergence and livestock systems. This resulted in the establishment of the Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems \(ZELS\) research programme, which allocated millions of pounds of funding to 17 projects. Updates planned on these scoping reports will inform new research programming over the next few years \[S3\]. 

 Evidence from \[R1\], \[R2\] and \[R3\] has furthermore contributed to the 2020 IPBES report on Biodiversity & Pandemics, has influenced the establishment of the EU’s PREZODE initiative to develop fundamental and operational research to prevent and manage future zoonotic disease outbreaks \[S2\] and \[S4\]. 

 Key evidence on zoonotic spill\-over \[R2\], \[R3\], has informed the 2020 Trinity Challenge \(a coalition aiming to improve the world’s protection against health emergencies, using data\-driven research and analytics\) representing millions of pounds of investment. Trinity Challenge Board Chair and former UK Chief Medical Officer Dame Professor said: “ *Your work on identifying global hotspots and EID risk has informed a lot of our early thinking in our “Identify” category of The Trinity Challenge*” \[S5\]. 

 **Policy and public health responses:** Research conducted by UCL and IOZ researchers is among key evidence linking emerging zoonotic diseases with land use and climate change. As a result, it has informed international and national policy priorities and public health responses to disease outbreaks \[S1\]. Some key policy impact examples include: 

-  Providing a scientific rationale and synthesis of research \[R1\] for ‘One Health’ multi\-sector approach to improving public health outcomes which is now a major component of pandemic prevention policy around the world \[S2\]; 

-  Evidence \[R1\], \[R2\] and \[R3\] used for the United Nations Environment Programme \(UNEP\)’s rapid assessment report \(2020\) ‘Preventing the next Pandemic’ led to UNEP joining an alliance with the World Organisation for Animal Health \(OIE\), Food and Agriculture Organisation \(FAO\), and World Health Organisation \(WHO\), recognising that there was a need to strengthen the environmental dimension of One Health global efforts \[S6\]. 

-  Underpinning evidence \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\] provided to the WWF ‘Beyond Boundaries’ 2020 report contributed directly to WWF’s ongoing work to influence policy and practice in a range of areas on linkages between environmental degradation, emerging infectious disease risk and human health. One example is the organisation’s work around mitigating the risk posed by the wildlife trade, particularly in East and South East Asia \[S7\]. 

-  Evidence on the impact of ecosystem degradation on zoonotic risk \[R2\] was provided by in 2020 for The Dasgupta Review commissioned by the UK’s HM Treasury setting out how nature should be accounted for in economics and decision making. This will inform policy discussions at the Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\) COP 15, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \(UNFCCC\) COP 26, and the G7 meeting in 2021 \[S8\]. In 2019, as evidenced by communication with the Chief Scientific Officer at FCDO: “ *The Ebola risk map from Redding et al. provided important contextual information to inform discussions with ministers in our short and medium term thinking on our response to Ebola*” \[R6\]. 

-  Finally, evidence on zoonotic disease emergence \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\] is informing current discussions within UK government and the G7 to develop a more strategic approach to understanding emerging zoonotic and biodiversity threats \[S9\]. 

 **3. Increasing public understanding of zoonotic disease risk** 

 The research in understanding zoonotic disease spill\-over processes \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\], \[R4\], \[R5\], \[R6\] has been communicated extensively through the international broadcast news and print media over the assessment period, thereby improving public understanding of zoonotic disease risks. Clear scientific communication has been particularly relevant during the global COVID\-19 pandemic and the research team have appeared in over 150 national, specialist, and international media outlets in 2020, sharing the research with an estimated audience of over 300 million people \[S11\]. Highlights have included contributions to BBC Radio 4’s flagship news show the ‘Today Programme’ and its ‘Inside Science’ programme, as well as the BBC World Service. Additionally, Professor Jones gave a cross\-departmental talk within the UK Government on predicting pandemics \[S9\] and co\-wrote, with Dr Redding, a special briefing to UK Government’s Cabinet Office \[S10\]. This informed several of the UK prime minister’s speeches for example, to the UN Summit on Biodiversity and to the UN General Assembly in 2020 \[S9\], \[S10\]. The research also helped to provide evidence on the environmental links to the emergence of zoonotic diseases for the UK Environmental Audit Committee \[S11\] in 2020. Jones acted as a scientific consultant on the BBC’s Horizon programme and its ‘Extinction: the Facts’ documentary presented by David Attenborough, which covered the links between deforestation and pandemic risk.
