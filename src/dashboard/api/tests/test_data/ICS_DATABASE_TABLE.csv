######  1. Summary of the impact 

 Geospatial analysis techniques developed by Diggle and Giorgi have been used directly by public health agencies in planning and delivering interventions to treat neglected tropical diseases \(NTDs\) in some of the world’s most adversely affected countries. This case study focuses on the impacts of Diggle and Giorgi’s research in the control efforts for four diseases: onchocerciasis, malaria, trachoma and soil\-transmitted helminths \(STH\). Public health mapping strategies have been adopted by governments at a continental scale, and the techniques have been used to plan treatment and resource allocation for over 100 million people, leading to the possibility of the elimination of some diseases in several resource\-poor countries and enabling resource savings in some of those countries of an estimated USD100 million. 
","
######  2. Underpinning research 

 In a 1998 paper, Diggle and two Lancaster colleagues introduced model\-based geostatistics \(MBG\). Compared with classical geostatistics, MBG uses efficient, principled methods of predictive inference. It is particularly well suited to low\-resource settings where, due to the lack of disease registries, monitoring of the disease burden is carried out through cross\-sectional prevalence surveys. In these settings, MBG provides a way of combining empirical prevalence data with remotely sensed images of environmental variables to construct predictive maps that can be an order of magnitude more precise than predictions based on classical survey sampling methods \[G5, R7\]. Diggle and colleagues have since continued to develop MBG methods, especially for use in low\-resources areas where the availability of comprehensive datasets is limited, and to promote their use amongst epidemiologists, geographers and statisticians. The 2016 article by Diggle and Giorgi \[G1, R1\] reviews methodological developments since the original 1998 paper, Giorgi and Diggle have also implemented the methodology in open\-source software \[R8\] and have delivered training courses in its use. 

 With funding from the WHO in 2005 \[G2, R2\], Diggle proposed a method for identifying areas that did or did not meet the WHO requirements for safe mass distribution of ivermectin \(Mectizan® donated for mass distribution by Merck\) in control efforts against *onchocerciasis* \(river blindness\). Widespread administration of drugs such as ivermectin kills the immature worm parasites responsible for this severely debilitating condition, but the drug needs to be re\-administered annually due to the long\-lived nature of the adult worms. In addition, a different parasitic infection, *loiasis* \(eye\-worm\), caused by the parasitic worm Loa loa, has a partially overlapping distribution with onchocerciasis; while ivermectin also kills immature Loa loa it can also produce severe, occasionally fatal, side effects in individuals with very severe eye\-worm infections, which presents a major obstacle to safe ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis control. Diggle and colleagues applied MBG methods to produce spatial risk maps for loiasis prevalence, initially in Cameroon in 2007 as a proof of concept \[R2\] and subsequently, in 2011 to delineate areas safe and unsafe for ivermectin treatment across the whole of Africa \[R3\] in line with the WHO’s policy recommendation to put in place precautionary measures against serious adverse reactions to the medication in areas where loiasis prevalence, as estimated by RAPLOA \(Rapid Assessment Procedure for Loiasis\), exceeds 40%. Unlike conventional mapping methods that provide only point estimates of prevalence, MBG has enabled the construction of probabilistic risk maps \(as shown in Figure 1\) which demarcates the study region into areas where the true prevalence is above \(red\) or below \(bright blue\) the 40% policy intervention threshold with a probability of at least 0.9 and a corridor of uncertainty where more data are needed to make an accurate prediction. 



 **Figure 1.** Predictive probability map showing the probability that Loiasis prevalence, as measured by a low\-cost questionnaire instrument, RAPLOA, exceeds 40% \[R3\]. 

 Other recent methodological developments by Diggle and Giorgi that are applicable to all NTDs include methods for the adaptive design of repeated cross\-sectional surveys \[G3, R4\]; multivariate methods for combining data from randomised and convenience surveys \[G1, R5\] or from multiple diagnostic tools \[G5, R6\]; and a novel approach to the design and analysis of so\-called elimination surveys, where the goal is to establish whether prevalence is low enough to meet the WHO requirement for the elimination of the disease in question as a public health problem \[G4, R7\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **4.1 Malaria** 

 In collaboration with partners in Africa such as the Somalian Ministry of Health and epidemiologists and geographic information system \(GIS\) experts from the KEMRI Wellcome Trust in Nairobi, Giorgi developed novel MBG methods and applied them for malaria mapping in sub\-Saharan Africa which has subsequently informed malaria control policies \[S1, S2\]. For example, in 2017, Somalia launched a 5\-year malaria strategic plan with the aim of sustaining malaria prevalence levels below 1% in the north and increasing access to treatment and vector control in the south. Giorgi drew on \[R1\] to fit spatio\-temporal MBG models to cross\-sectional prevalence survey data collected between 2005 and 2015 to identify regions highly likely to have malaria prevalence above or below 1% \(Figure 2, left\-hand panel\). Giorgi also ran the analysis for Sudan \[S2\] using data from cross\-sectional surveys conducted between 2000 and 2016 \(Figure 2, right\-hand panel\). 

 
           
 

  

 **Figure 2.** *Left\-hand panel:* classification of the 18 regions in Somalia based on their estimated probability of malaria prevalence below the 1% threshold, as indicated by the legend. *Right\-hand panel:* classification of areas of Sudan according to their probability of low prevalence \(northern Sudan, shades of green\) or high prevalence \(southern Sudan, shades of red\), as indicated by the legend. 

 The maps shown in Figure 2 allowed the distinction of areas highly likely to have achieved public health policy targets and areas that require additional sampling effort to be classified correctly, which triggered a significant shift in the decision\-making process, which was previous informed by maps of predicted malaria prevalence that did not acknowledge the inherent uncertainty. This provided evidence for public health policy decisions in Somalia, Kenya and other countries. In the words of the Head of the Strategic Information Unit at the Global Malaria Programme, World Health Organization, “ *Professor Peter Diggle and Dr Emanuele Giorgi’s work has not only been extremely helpful to analysing the spatial and temporal changes of malaria in Somalia and Kenya as well other African countries, but it has also been instrumental in changing policy and practice through the development of national strategic plans for malaria for these countries. This is a clear demonstration of how research evidence can immediately translate in policies and action in countries to reduce the burden of malaria”* \[S3\]. 

 In addition to the research being directly adopted by national programmes for malaria in the worst affected countries in Africa, Giorgi and Diggle’s research and outreach has also supported capacity\-building within resource\-constrained countries in tackling other public health priorities, leading in particular to impact in Kenya where vaccination policies have been shaped by work on infant mortality undertaken by African statisticians \[S3\]. 

 **4.2 Onchocerciasis** 

 Since 2015, the focus of Lancaster research on onchocerciasis control has been to develop methods for the optimal combination of mobile microscopy and a rapid diagnostic test to determine which areas are and are not safe for mass drug administration. In 2015, Diggle began a formal collaboration with the NTD Centre of the Task Force for Global Health \(TFGH\). Predictions from geospatial statistical models were validated by in\-country data from Nigeria, Cameroon and Gabon. As a result, the prediction algorithm has been incorporated into the LoaScope devices procured by the Gates Foundation and has been considered a viable strategy that the TFGH and its partners are interested in piloting in other global NTD\-affected areas \[S4\]. In January 2020, the TFGH NTD Centre Director of Research stated that Diggle and Giorgi’s work has been “ *instrumental in developing a comprehensive Loa loa mapping strategy at the continental scale*” \[S4\]. The theoretical contributions \[R1\] have been used to develop new analytic tools that avoid the need to test every individual with the LoaScope diagnostic, enabling an estimated resource savings of USD100 million \[S4\]. In addition, according to the Director of Research, TFGH NTD Centre, due to Diggle and Giorgi’s contributions to the development of these analytic tools, “ *onchocerciasis may be possible to eliminate in areas where Loa Loa is co\-endemic \(a 10 country region with over 85 million individuals\)*” \[S4\]. 

 **4.3 Trachoma** 

 In 2018, Diggle and Giorgi began working with the WHO's Global Trachoma Elimination Programme and used their MBG methods and software \[R1, R8\], to provide estimates of the burden and fine\-scale spatial distribution of Trachomatous trichiasis cases throughout Ethiopia. The importance of this work was summarised by the Trachoma Medical Officer of the Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases \(DCNTD\) in 2019, “ *It will allow highly resource\-restricted national trachoma programmes, currently active in more than 50 countries, to better target services to deliver sight\-saving operations. These operations are needed by 2.5 million of the world’s poorest and more marginalized individuals”* \[S5\]. 

 The Ethiopian analysis provides an example of the direct use of Diggle and Giorgi’s developed analytical approaches for trachoma control, as confirmed in 2020 by the Trachoma Medical Officer, who stated, “ *Geostatistical approaches have been applied to all available current data on trichiasis in Ethiopia, the world’s most heavily trachoma\-affected country. They were used to calculate the probability that the TT component of trachoma’s elimination as a public health problem has already been achieved, for each of 482 evaluation units, finding that it had been with probability 0.9 or more in only eight of those evaluation units. In other words, continuing heavy investment in trichiasis surgery programmes is needed in that country*” \[S5\]. 

 **4.4 Soil\-transmitted helminths \(STH\)** 

 In 2017, Diggle began working with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Health to provide research techniques to inform their de\-worming strategy. The Senior Professor of Parasitology at the University of Kelaniya, responsible for the oversight of the Ministry’s de\-worming programme, stated in 2020, “ *As a result of using the geostatistical modelling techniques that Prof Diggle have equipped us with, the Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka has revised its approach to deworming for STH infections in the entire country. The design of this new strategy would not have been possible without using the modelling techniques developed by Prof Diggle, and without his input, the revised strategy would have resulted in either overtreatment \(with unnecessary use of anthelmintics\) or undertreatment, resulting in rebound in the prevalence of STH infections in Sri Lanka*” \[S6\]. 

 All the software developed for these analyses is publicly available as an open source R package,  [PrevMap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PrevMap/index.html), with associated tutorial material \[G1, R8\]. Between January 2016 and December 2020 the package was downloaded 25,965 times \[S7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lifespan has increased, but older adults are spending more time, proportionally, in poor health. Many older adults also suffer from memory problems that can lead to depression and anxiety. Owing to the **A**ston **R**esearch **C**entre for **H**ealth **A**geing established status, and Brown’s burgeoning personal reputation in biogerontology, Brown \(ARCHA’s director\) was invited to design and analyse the scientific experiments that underpinned two Channel 4 series of “Old People’s Home for 4 Year Olds”. Those programmes and Brown’s subsequent involvement with multiple stakeholders have led to improvements in national attitude, commercial reputation and individuals’ quality of life. 

 Impacts on **Health & Wellbeing**, **Culture** and **Commerce** are claimed. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background:** Human lifespan continues to increase in the UK, but the number of years spent in poor health is increasing yet more quickly \(Office for National Statistics, 2016\-2018\); a challenge to individuals, their families, healthcare systems and society. Functional decline associated with the ageing process is a significant cause of morbidity \(disease/other medical conditions\) and mortality. In many older adults, later years are spent in frailty and/or cognitive decline. These age\-related states of vulnerability are associated with increased risk of falls, disability, mental or physical illness and hospitalisation. Indeed, estimates suggest that 17.4% of the global population is frail and 49.3% ‘prefrail’. Many older adults also suffer from over\-general memory – a condition associated with both depression and anxiety. 

 In 2009, Griffiths founded the Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing \(ARCHA\) as an interdisciplinary centre of excellence involving biologists, psychologists, pharmacists, opthalmologists and engineers, to engage holistically in all aspects of ageing research with the over\-arching aim of achieving research contributions to good health in older adults. 

 **Underpinning Research:** Within ARCHA, from their respective backgrounds in metabolic disorders, psychology and redox biology, Brown, Holland and Griffiths have together created a body of knowledge involving the metabolism associated with ageing, the link between physical activity and biomarkers of ageing, simple interventions to reduce hospital re\-admission post\-discharge by the NHS and the assessment/therapy of frailty and cognitive decline in older adults. 

 **Research Insights/Findings:** Frailty is not inevitable or irreversible and has many means of detection. ARCHA research identified that a biological marker of frailty \(telomere length\) is influenced by irisin, an exercise hormone in healthy subjects \( **S3.1**\), whilst fats in the blood associated with diet and exercise can predict ageing in healthy individuals \( **S3.2**\). Particularly pertinent to the current pandemic, Brown, Griffiths and colleagues reviewed the role that metabolic programming and loss of redox homeostasis play during ageing in the decline of T cell function, which is thought to contribute to reduced response to infection and vaccination \( **S3.3**\). On the psychological front, Brown and colleagues determined that a simple phone call from a community nurse with potential to follow\-up via primary care where needed, reduced re\-admission to hospital of over\-65\-year\-olds by more than 40% \( **S3.4**\), whilst Holland and colleagues demonstrated that both Memory Specific Training \(MEST\) and life review could help to restore autobiographical memory, so reducing over\-general memory and alleviating symptoms of both depression and anxiety \( **S3.5**\). Via systematic review, they also determined the absolute necessity of patient and carer inclusion in identification of needs and interventions to reduce refusal of key services \( **S3.6**\). 

 **ARCHA Roles:** Prof Helen Griffiths founded ARCHA in 2009. Dr Carol Holland became ARCHA director in 2016. Dr James Brown was ARCHA’s first\-appointed postdoctoral researcher, was promoted to Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Associate Professor in 2013, 2016 and 2018 respectively and was appointed director of ARCHA in 2018.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Context:** ARCHA’s research\-based interaction with care homes started when Holland studied the effect on older adults of moving into an Extracare Charitable Trust retirement community. By 2015, she had demonstrated that Extracare’s approach of integrated housing, care and support led to quantifiable reductions in NHS/social care costs at 12 months, plus a 10.1% improvement in residents’ autobiographical memory and accompanying 14.8% reduction in depressive symptoms at 18 months \( **S5.1**\). Meanwhile, in 2017, TV company CPL productions Ltd. \(CPL\) chose to create a TV series examining the benefits of intergenerational care \(regular interaction between nursery children and care\-home residents\). Importantly, CPL wished to substantiate their episodes with scientific evidence, rather than relying simply on anecdote. 

 Brown’s established research expertise in biogerontology \( **S3.1\-S3.3**\), wellbeing in older adults \( **S3.4**\) and ARCHA’s past experience with care homes \( **S5.1**\) led CPL productions Ltd. to select Brown, as director of ARCHA, to design the series’ scientific underpinning tests \(a package of physiological and cognitive analyses\) to quantify the effects of intergenerational activities on older adult volunteers \( **S5.2**\). Brown was teamed with clinicians experienced in intergenerational activities and an early\-years expert, to conduct the study for Channel 4. Series 1 \(2 episodes\) was followed by a second series \(5 episodes\) based in the same Extracare village that Holland had studied previously.  Brown consulted in both series, analysed the data, featured on\-screen in series 2 and importantly, continued his research/engagement with participants after Series 2 completion. Brown’s work with CPL, the resulting broadcast of Old People’s Home for 4 Year Olds \(OPHF4YO\) and Brown’s follow\-up interactions with participants have led to: 

####  Impact on Health and Wellbeing 1 \- demonstrable improvements for older adults: 

 In series 2, Brown recorded statistically\-significant improvements in balance, walking speed, grip strength, mood, overall cognitive function and episodic memory in older adult volunteers. His follow\-up research found that these improvements were retained 6 months later and were also accompanied by outstanding improvements in residents’ quality of life \( **S5.3**\). Qualitatively, a resident stated “Personally, I improved in every one \[test\], sometimes spectacularly….I still find that I can converse freely and have lost the fear of starting up dialogues” \(this resident had described himself previously as “almost a hermit” **S5.3**\). 

 Importantly, this impact was not limited to the care home/nursery featured in the TV series. The owner of Berrington Lodge Nursery \(opened Sept\-2018\) wrote to Brown in December 2018, to say that OPHF4YO had inspired her to undertake similar intergenerational activities with a neighbouring care home \( **S5.4**\). Her recent update revealed that by mid\-2019, their intergenerational activity had “grown from strength to strength” *.* Describing multiple indoor and outdoor co\-activities, she also described the two\-way curiosity between generations and quoted a care home resident who stated “ **This has switched my brain back on, I now have something to look forward \[to\] and think about**”. With interactions currently curtailed to remote activities, the manager states: “We can’t wait for the time when we can visit the residents once more” \( **S5.4**\) *.* 

####  Impact on Health and Wellbeing 2 \- demonstrable improvements for nursery children: 

 Brown also worked closely with the early years expert who confirmed accompanying improvements in the children’s behaviour, both quantitatively from test data and qualitatively from parents’ observations. These confirmed that most children in OPHF4YO had improved confidence, language development, independence, imagination, maturity, empathy and concentration \( **S5.5**\). Qualitatively, a parent cites Brown’s continued \(post\-series\) engagement and states numerous benefits to her son, including “It has opened up \[son’s\] circle of friends. He refers to his favourite of the older adults … when listing his friends – right alongside his 5\-year\-old friends from school. In his eyes there is no difference” \( **S5.5**\). This change in perspective is again supported by Berrington Lodge’s manager who states “The strong bond we have with \[care home\] has reinforced their \[children’s\] respect for the elderly” **\(S5.4\)** *.* 

####  Impact on Culture and Society \- the OPHF4YO legacy: 

 Numerous other UK care homes and nurseries cite OPHF4YO as their inspiration for commencing intergenerational activities \( **S5.6**\) whilst the Secretary of State for Health, the Rt Hon. Matt Hancock MP called for “intergenerational care to become routine” \( **S5.7**\). Intent has been followed by investment. United for All Ages \(UAA\) state “intergenerational activities have exploded due to the two series of OPHF4YO”. Working with Millenium Care, UAA are delivering a £12m intergenerational development program \( **S5.8**\). Meanwhile, OPHF4YO inspired ParkDean Resorts to commission research into intergenerational benefit and consequently, Brown consulted in developing the ‘Great Grandparent Getaway’ campaign. Despite the pandemic, ParkDean have now launched the UK’s first four\-generation holiday package \( **S5.9**\). 

####  Impact on Commerce & Economy \- international reputational & financial gains for CPL Productions Ltd. and Red Seven Entertainment: 

 Series 1 of OPHF4YO reached >2.5 million viewers per episode. Series 2 averaged 1.8 million viewers over 5 episodes, was 4th among human interest documentaries on Channel 4 and was a top\-10 UK trending subject on Twitter in each week of broadcast. Multiple awards and a BAFTA nomination accorded to OPHF4YO benefitted CPL’s reputation, culminating in their nomination for best Independent Production Company at the Broadcast Awards 2019 \( **S5.10**\). This high profile has also led to international sales: the format is now licensed to 15 countries over 3 continents, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and multiple European countries \( **S5.10**\) with associated financial gain.

 **1.** **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Almost 50,000 individuals are diagnosed every year with prostate cancer in the UK, with an estimated 400,000 living with the disease \(Prostate Cancer UK, 2020\). The radiopharmaceutical Xofigo® is approved in more than 40 countries \(European Medicines Agency, 2020\) for the treatment of prostate cancer with bone metastases and has been shown to increase life expectancy and quality of life significantly \(Parker et al., *N Engl J Med* 2013; 369:213\-223\). 

 Professor Regan’s group at the University of Surrey and the National Physical Laboratory \(NPL\) led research resulting in the re\-evaluation of the primary calibration standards and the resetting of calibration factors for Xofigo® in more than 3,000 clinics worldwide. 
","
 **2.** **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Xofigo® \(radium \(Ra\-223\) \- dichloride\) is a registered palliative therapy for prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases \( [http://bayer.com/en/innovation/research\-development\-drugs](http://bayer.com/en/innovation/research-development-drugs)\). Since radium is chemically similar to calcium, it binds selectively to areas of increased cell turnover in bone metastases. At these sites, the Ra\-223 active material emits alpha particles which deposit their energy over a range corresponding to between 2 and 10 cell layers. The rapid slowing down and energy dispersion of these alpha particles causes double\-strand DNA breaks, leading to a cytotoxic effect on tumour cells. Xofigo® is used in more than 3,000 clinics worldwide to provide life\-extending treatments for patients with metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer \(CRPC\). To ensure that patients are treated with the correct dosage, detailed information on the radioactive decay properties of this material are required.  The accurate measurement of radium \(Ra\-223\) dichloride activity is assured by adjustment of dose calibrators using the National Measurements Institute \(NMI\) traceable reference standard, which is provided to the licensee of the drug. The absolute accuracy of the traceable standard is the first point in the calibration chain and, if incorrect, results in potentially too high or too low doses of the drug being administered. 

 The high\-precision nuclear decay data associated with the isotope\-specific radioactive signatures for Ra\-223 measured by Prof. Regan’s group **\[R1\-R3\]**, underpins the provision of an absolute primary calibration standard for dose application for Xofigo® and indeed all radiopharmaceuticals. Primary calibration standards are linked directly to clinic\-based sources and the related ionisation chamber calibration factors which are needed to determine the dose administered to patients. It is crucial for public and clinical confidence in the quality assurance of such treatments that the clinic\-based calibration factors are directly traceable to the primary standards held at NMIs, such as the National Physical Laboratory \(UK\) and the National Institute for Standards and Technology \(NIST\) in the USA. Cross\-continental measurements need to be consistent when compared with each other and any other standards held at each NMI. If they are inconsistent, different doses of Ra\-223 may be administered to patients depending on where they are being treated. 

 The precision radioactive decay data generated by Prof. Regan’s group **\[R1\-R3\]** led directly to the correction of the NIST\-based standard for the first alpha admitting radiopharmaceutical approved for the treatment of metastatic castration\-resistant prostate cancer. As a result, the clinic\-based calibration factors were revised by more than 10% following the correction of the US\-based standard held by NIST \(see  [https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1526/ML15264B095.pdf](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1526/ML15264B095.pdf)\). When compared to the previously claimed calibration accuracy of 0.3% \( [https://dx.doi.org/10.6028%2Fjres.120.004](https://dx.doi.org/10.6028%2Fjres.120.004)\), this systematic shift/error of this magnitude could have led to significant over/under dosage of Xofigo® and a significant effect on ultimate patient outcomes \( [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697)\). 

 Prof. Regan’s group also conducted a range of measurements to provide the absolute nuclear decay data for other related, pre\-clinical radiopharmaceutical nuclides, including thorium \(Th\-227\) **\[R2\]**. This is particularly important as this radionuclide is used as a generator source for Ra\-223, the active material used in Xofigo® **\[R1, R2\]**. This work was conducted using the same experimental analysis and interpretation techniques as Prof. Regan’s STFC\-funded studies into the decay signatures of radioactive nuclei for absolute standardisation **\[R4, R5\]** and the evolution of nuclear structure with changing proton and neutron numbers \(e.g. **\[R6\]**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research led by Prof. Regan’s Nuclear Metrology Group \(Surrey\-NPL\), identified a major discrepancy in the existing primary standardisation of the alpha\-emitting radiopharmaceutical material Ra\-223. High\-precision radioactive decay data generated and validated by the Surrey\-NPL group **\[R1\-R3\]** was responsible for the 2015 revision to the National Institute of Standards and Technology \(NIST\) standard for the use of the castration\-resistant prostate cancer therapy, Xofigo®. The calibration\-factor correction was initiated following the identification of discrepancies between the existing radiological standards and the underpinning nuclear decay data by Prof. Regan’s group **\[R1\-R6\]**, some two orders of magnitude greater than the acceptable range with regards to primary standards. In clinical trials, larger dosages of Xofigo® have been shown to lead to increased radiological progression that caused treatment to be prematurely terminated \( [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02023697)\). In such instances, such a large miscalibration error could have led to significantly poorer health outcomes for patients on Xofigo®. 

 Correcting the global radiopharmaceutical standard for Xofigo®: Nuclear decay data measurements by Prof. Regan’s group highlighted a discrepancy in the pre\-existing \(2008\) standard for the alpha\-emitter Ra\-223. This prompted a thorough evaluation by NIST who, after replicating the experimental work, confirmed an approximate \+10% adjustment in the absolute calibration factor from their existing \(2008\) standard. The high\-precision nuclear decay data, generated by Prof. Regan’s group, led directly to the provision of the updated, corrected, absolute primary calibration standard. 

 On 11 March 2015, NIST published information regarding the revised primary standard for Ra\-223 resulting in a numerical increase of 10.5% for the new primary standard. **\[S1, S2\]** This change was only to the numerical value of the quantity of Ra\-223, as the actual amount of Ra\-223 in the primary standard did not change. Thus, the work conducted by Prof. Regan and the NPL Nuclear Metrology Group provided the foundation and motivation for the upgraded standardisation for the Ra\-223 radionuclide by NIST. This is confirmed by the statement in **\[S1\]** by the NIST group \(as **\[S3\]**\): “As a result of a discrepancy involving our published secondary standards for 223Ra brought to our attention by colleagues at the National Physical Laboratory, we have undertaken a thorough review of our 2008 work and performed two large studies to re\-standardize this radionuclide that will hopefully provide an explanation for the source of the discrepancy” and “This new primary standard is based on measurements made with methods that are more robust than those available in the original 2008 experiments.” **\[S1\]** 

 In March 2015, Bayer Pharmaceuticals Ltd notified the clinical community to this change in calibration dial factor standards following the revision of the \(NIST\) standard **\[S4, S5\]**. This required a simultaneous worldwide recalibration of all devices for measuring radiation dose carried out at more than 3,000 clinics worldwide. Bayer also stated that they would increase the numerical values listed on the package label by approximately 10%. That is, the labelling of the patient dose was updated from 50 kBq/kg of body weight to 55 kBq/kg of body weight, and product documentation was updated to read 110 kBq/ml \(previously 1000 kBq/ml\) and 6.6 MBq/vial \(previously 6.0 MBq/vial\). Bayer further stated that the revised standard for Ra\-223 does not change the actual amount of Ra\-223 dichloride being administered to patients and will therefore not impact the safety and efficacy of Xofigo® **\[S5\-S7\]**. 

 Absolute, traceable radioactivity standards are vital in retaining public confidence in the application of every radiopharmaceutical in the medical arena worldwide. The discrepancy identified by Prof. Regan’s group **\[S1\-S8\]** in the universally accepted standard for the alpha\-emitter Ra\-223 highlights the need for a continuous evaluation of the radiopharmaceuticals currently in use worldwide and the potential impact on the future of cancer treatments.

 ‘DESCRIPTION OF CIRCUMSTANCES 

 In 2013, NIST was made aware of studies performed by the National Physical Laboratory \(NPL\) \(the National Measurement Institute of the United Kingdom\) in which an approximately 10 percent difference was found between NPL’s activities obtained using several primary methods and those obtained with the calibration factors published by NIST from 2010. Subsequently, NIST performed additional testing using more robust methods than previously available to verify NPL’s results and confirmed that activity readings were lower than expected.   On March 11, 2015, NIST published information regarding the revised primary standard for Ra\-223 resulting in a numerical increase of 10.5 percent for the new primary standard.’

 \[S6\]. Introduction of XOFIGO© in the UK \(from 2014\): 

 ‘Xofigo © \(radium\-223 dichloride\), which has been hailed as a “huge step forward” in treating prostate cancer patients, is now available for the treatment of men with castration\-resistant prostate cancer who have symptomatic bone metastases. 

 The drug was so successful in the trial phases that it was stopped early once it became clear that the drug was effective. The drug not only enabled men to live longer but when they are taking it they have fewer side\-effects and less pain, giving them a better quality of life.’ 

 ‘Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men in the UK. In 2010, around 41,000 men were diagnosed with the disease. On average, 10\-20% of prostate cancer patients develop castration\-resistant prostate cancer \(CRPC\) within approximately 5 years of follow up and of those almost 84% have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.’  [https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/news\-and\-events/news/xofigo\-radium\-223\-launches\-uk](https://www.royalmarsden.nhs.uk/news-and-events/news/xofigo-radium-223-launches-uk)

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ringrose’s research has focused attention on the consequences of gender inequality and lack of diversity in representations of girls and women in media and society, influencing changes in nation\-wide policy and educational practice. Through research she led for the Mayor of London and Transport for London \(TfL\), she provided the evidence and insight to underpin a high\-profile competition process that has: galvanised innovation in the marketing sector and in business; triggered concrete changes in advertising policy; stimulated millions of conversations about body image across the UK; and delivered significant economic impact, prompting the award of over £1m of advertising space and increasing the market share of competition winners. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Context and background:** There has been much public concern about sexism and sexualisation in the media and advertising. But attempts to challenge gender inequalities in representation have often failed to attend to intersecting inequalities around class, race and culture, which work together to create homogenous and exclusionary imagery. Ringrose’s research documents how young people experience and navigate sexual imagery **\(R1, R2, R3\)** and a lack of diversity in representations of girls and women **\(R3\)**. Her work on digital feminist activism **\(R4\)** explores how media and technology can be harnessed for positive change, documenting how women and girls fight back online against sexism and create new messages of change that are spread through the connective medium of social media **\(R4, R6\)**. A mass online protest in 2015 ‘calling out’ a body shaming advertisement running in TfL sparked the Mayor of London to commission Ringrose to undertake research on women’s experiences of gender and advertising, due to her profile and expertise in these areas **\(R5, R6\)**. 

 **Methodology:** Across her research, Ringrose has used a range of creative participatory methodologies to document how young people use new media technologies to represent themselves **\(R1\-3\)** and also how marginalised groups harness technological tools to transform society **\(R4\)**. She has used documentary methods like filming interviews with participants while on their daily commute to capture women and girls’ experiences of advertising in public spaces **\(R5, R6\)**, as well as arts\-based methods, such as collaging, to create artefacts that illuminate the concerns of diverse, marginalised groups of girls and women about how they are represented and treated in society **\(R5, R6\)**. For instance, in **R5** the girls created ‘talk\-back’ collages by cutting and pasting the advertising content that was discussed as part of the research together with alterations, \- ‘craftbacks’ \- that they made to the images. 

 <ins>Research outputs and programme:</ins> 

1.  Multiple studies on sexism and sexualisation of girls **\(R1, R2\)**, including pioneering work \(2012\) funded by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children on gender inequalities and sexual behaviour in youth\-produced sexual imagery. 

1.  Qualitative interviews on how ethnically diverse girls navigate sexist, sexualised and racialised media and how it shapes their body image. This research was funded in 2014 by the Society of Research on Adolescence **\(R3\)**. 

 Analysis of media content and interviews with 82 diverse women and girls to study their resistance to sexism and sexual violence through online feminist activism; funded in 2015 by the Arts and Humanities Research Council **\(R4\)**. 

 Quantitative survey of 2,012 women’s and men’s views on gender, diversity and advertising in London’s public spaces; travelling interviews with 16 women \(aged 21\-65\) on public transport, using audio, video and images to record responses to advertisements; and focus group and participatory art practices with 22 teen girls in schools, writing upon and altering advertising content and creating their own images and slogans in arts\-based collages. Ringrose was commissioned to lead this study in 2018 by the Mayor of London \(sponsored by TfL’s advertising sales agents, Exterion Media and JCDecaux\), culminating in the research report: “ *The Women We See: Women and Girls’ Experiences of Gender and Diversity in Advertising*” **\(R5\)**. 

 **Key findings from “The Women We See” \(WWS\) study \(R5, R6\):** 

 Advertising in London does not reflect the city’s diverse population with some groups feeling much less represented than others. Only one in three Londoners feel adverts are relevant to them. Specifically: 

1.  Just over half of BAME Londoners surveyed stated their ethnicity is not well represented in advertising – compared to a fifth of white respondents. 

1.  In failing to fully represent London’s ethnic and cultural diversity, participants felt advertising promoted ideals of white beauty as normal. 

1.  Older women felt the most invisible and least represented in advertisements, whilst girls felt the most sexualised. 

1.  Women of all ages were concerned about sexualised uses of women’s bodies and slogans to sell unrelated products, and about the use of Photoshopping. 

 <ins>Main recommendations:</ins> 

1.  A more equitable and inclusive standard of advertising, showcasing all forms of diversity. 

1.  The minimisation of sexualised and sexually degrading images of women. 

1.  Advertisers should carefully consider the use of Photoshop and use more diverse body types. 

1.  Advertisements should be based on the product with realistic, useful and interesting information.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Reach and significance:** Ringrose has influenced youth policy initiatives on body image and her research has informed Relationship and Sex Education \(RSE\) lessons plans and resources delivered to 31,000 school children in the UK. The ‘Women We See’ \(WWS\) research she led has influenced the UK advertising sector and policies, and underpinned advertising campaigns, which earned approximately 1,500,000,000 impressions on social media, generating a national conversation about the representation of women. 

 **Principal Beneficiaries:** 

 Young people; women experiencing menopause; mothers; the UK advertising industry, its providers and regulators \(i.e. TfL, Advertising Standards Authority\) and the viewing public who use the TfL network \(approx. 5,000,000 passengers per day in 2018,  [tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about\-tfl/what\-we\-do](http://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do)\). 

 **Instrumental impact on educational and youth policy** 

 In 2017, Ringrose gave live testimony in Parliament for the British Youth Council Select Committee’s review on *Body Confidence* **\(S1\)**. Her oral testimony at Parliament on gendered, sexualised and racialised norms of the body was cited throughout the Committee’s report \(12 times in total\) highlighting the negative sexist effects of advertising and the need for schools to understand and support diversity of size and shape and attend to young people’s well\-being. The report received extensive coverage in the mainstream UK media, and consolidated Ringrose’s public profile in the area of sexualisation, body image and youth voice in leading social change; contributing to her being commissioned to undertake research on gender inequality, body image and advertising for the Mayor of London **\(R5, R6\)**. 

 **Conceptual impact in education sector and with young people** 

 Ringrose’ innovative methodologies such as the arts\-based collages used in the WWS research, addressing inequality and lack of diversity in advertising, were designed to enable marginalised girls and women to create authentic and empowering representations of themselves **\(R5, R6\)**. These methods have gone on to directly shape educational resources. Ringrose has been advising the charity School of Sexuality Education since 2017, which has adopted her arts\-based activism methods to create RSE lesson plans for schools on inequality issues around media and gender. Lessons delivered to date have involved 31,000 young people in the UK **\(S2\)**. These research\-informed sessions include running workshops on cyberbullying, digital feminist activism, and positive uses of social media. The lesson on ‘Body Positivity’ includes the collaging art activism participatory methodology. An evaluation survey of 229 participants found: 90% strongly agree or agree that they have a better understanding of how to make their social media a more body positive space; 86% strongly agree or agree that they have a better understanding of digital activism and how people speak online about the issues that matter to them, and 60% strongly agree they feel happier in, or more confident about their body because of the School of Sexuality Education workshops **\(S2\)**. 

 **Instrumental impact on advertising policy** 

 In 2018, Ringrose was commissioned as part of the Mayor of London’s year\-long women’s equality campaign \#BehindEveryGreatCity to undertake research on gender in advertising in response to public outcry over sexism in TfL advertising. The research report ‘Women we see: Diverse girls and women’s experiences of gender and advertising in London’s Public Spaces’ **\(R5\)** prompted the launch of a competition by TfL and the GLA which called on creative agencies and brands to respond to ‘What Women See’ recommendations to challenge gender stereotypes, increase diversity and create more positive and inclusive campaigns **\(S3\)**. The research directly informed the creative brief and judging criteria for two GLA and TfL UK\-wide competitions **\(S3\)** challenging brands to produce more equitable, socially responsible advertising campaigns, with the report referenced on the Competition landing page **\(S4\)**. The winning entries included: 

1.  2019: Holland and Barrett ‘Me.No.Pause’ campaign \(winner, created by Pablo\) responded to research findings of lack of representation of ageing women in ads, with a ‘taboo’ breaking campaign on diverse women’s experiences of menopause **\(S5\)**. 

1.  2019 Mothercare’s ‘Body Proud Mums’ campaign \(runner\-up, created by Mcgarrybowen\) responded to the findings Londoners want to see more diverse body shapes and sizes with a campaign on diverse postpartum bodies **\(S6\)**. 

1.  2020: “A Different type of Nude” Nubian Skin \(winner, created in\-house by brand\). The success of the 2019 campaign led to it being run again in 2020 with a focus on the underrepresentation of BAME Londoners **\(S7\)**. 

 Together these winning campaigns have been awarded GBP1,100,000 of advertising space **\(S3, S8\)**. 

 The policy impact of the research extends beyond these competitions: The research influenced TfL’s Advertising Steering Group who are *‘building on these results and working with key stakeholders across the industry to embed the learnings in the work of agencies and brands’* **\(S3\).** The WWS report was also sent to the National Advertising Standards Authority \(ASA\), which updated their guidance on depicting gender stereotypes in December 2018. A GLA spokesperson said, ‘ *the ASA’s timely publication … demonstrated the work we are collectively doing in this area is part of a movement driving forward change*’ **\(S7\)**. 

 **Instrumental impact within advertising sector and brands** 

 The WWS research has raised awareness around improving diversity in advertising, helping the GLA to begin ‘ *the long\-term change required*’ in the advertising sector via the competitions **\(S3\)**, which resulted in over 750 unique page views of the competition site by agencies and brands with 90 submissions **\(S3\)** and 2622 views of a film describing the research findings, hosted on this page **\(S4\).** The competition created extensive media coverage across regional, national, international TV, radio and print, illustrating the power to effect change \(e.g. ITV news, The Guardian, Campaign, The Drum\). A senior GLA spokesperson confirmed the vital contribution of the research to an industry wide change: ‘ *Working so closely with yourselves at UCL, Exterion, JCDecaux and the brands and agencies we have shown the positive impact of bringing the whole industry together – creating campaigns that are more inclusive’* **\(S7\)**. Pablo agency noted how ‘ *thought\-provoking*’ the WWS report was for the advertising industry: who are ‘ *becoming aware of diversity and equality issues yet they are often on the periphery*’. Pablo also noted: ‘ *Shining a light onto the wider cultural context and social attitudes, \[the research\] affirmed our idea and gave a platform to springboard the campaign. The Me.No.Pause. campaign very successfully responded to the report’s recommendations. More broadly, the learnings from the report are being taken on board across our work throughout our client base*’ **\(S5\)**. The Mcgarrybowen agency stated, ‘ *We believe this campaign marks a step change in marketing to mothers and exemplifies the positive impact that can be achieved through this powerful medium*’ **\(S6\)**. 

 **Conceptual impact on viewing public** 

 The winning campaigns provided a unique opportunity for more diverse women across the UK to feel better represented and more positive about ageing and body image **\(S6\)**, as explained by exposure and positive recognition of the winning brands, leading to the opportunity to be seen across over 31,000,000 journeys in 2019 **\(S5\)**. A YouGov survey showed ‘ *…just 2 weeks after its launch, 11% of the female population \- 2.9m women – had talked to friends, family or colleagues about Holland & Barrett’s campaign. To date, the campaign has achieved 495 million\+ impressions*’ **\(S9\)**. Mothercare received global impact of 1 billion impressions on social media; nationwide and international publicity, winning multiple awards for its use of 10 unretouched portraits of real mums with post\-birth bodies holding their babies **\(S6, S10\).** And, in a reflection of women’s own feelings of solidarity towards the campaign, mothers across the country posted powerful emotional testimonies and positive images of their own postpartum bodies on social media **\(S6, S10\).** 

 **Economic impact** 

 As well as galvanising the investment of over GBP1,000,000 of advertising space, the uptake of the research findings also resulted in significant commercial impact for the successful entries, demonstrating that taking diversity seriously makes sound business sense. It also led to wider cultural shifts and capacity building: Holland and Barrett undertook nationwide in\-store training for 6000 employees for supporting customers with managing menopause \(S5, S9\) and footfall increased by 17%. Core menopause product sales increased 171% during and immediately after the campaign and overall basket size was GBP1 higher. Overall brand health grew by 11% to reach its highest ever level: ‘ *Perhaps even more encouragingly, this increase was driven largely by infrequent shoppers, suggesting that the campaign challenged preconceptions about the store and lured back people who routinely shopped elsewhere*’ **\(S9\).** In addition, Mothercare also saw a 2.8% market share increase versus the period immediately before the campaign **\(S10\).** 

 In recognition of the sustained impact of her research, advocacy and public engagement work, Ringrose won the 2020 Distinguished Contributions to Gender Equity in Education Research Award, from the American Educational Research Association.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers at The Institute of Cancer Research \(ICR\) led translational and clinical research to improve outcomes for breast cancer patients treated with endocrine therapy. This work led to the following impacts: 

-  **Policy.** Data from our research underpinned the 2018 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) recommendation of 3 prognostic tests in early stage breast cancer: EndoPredict \(EPclin score\), Oncotype DX, and PAM50/ROR \(Prosigna\). 

-  **Patients.** These tests provide accurate predictions of risk and are used to determine who should be offered chemotherapy after surgery, thereby sparing some women unnecessary treatment that affects their quality of life. The Oncotype DX test has been used to guide treatment decisions for more than 1,000,000 cancer patients worldwide. 

-  **Commercial.** Revenue from the Oncotype DX tests was USD299,400,000 in 2018 which was an increase of 18% from 2017. 

-  **New therapies to overcome endocrine treatment resistance.** As a result of the PALOMA\-3 study, led by Professor Nicholas Turner, palbociclib combined with fulvestrant is being used internationally to treat advanced oestrogen\-receptor positive \(ER\+\) breast cancer patients who had progression or relapse during previous endocrine therapy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background.** Approximately 80% of breast cancers are ER\+ and are at least partly dependent on oestrogens for their growth. These cancers are treated with endocrine therapy, such as \(a\) aromatase inhibitors \(AIs\), a treatment that blocks the synthesis of oestrogen, \(b\) tamoxifen, which blocks oestrogen binding to its receptor and \(c\) fulvestrant, which promotes ER degradation. 

 **Clinical benefit of aromatase inhibitors.** The ICR and our hospital partner, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust \(RM\), played a key role in the ATAC \(anastrozole, tamoxifen, alone or in combination\) phase 3 clinical trial. Professor Mitch Dowsett, ICR Professor and Honorary Faculty, was part of the core group involved in developing the protocol for this study and analysing the results alongside Mike Baum \(ICR Team Leader 1990–1996\), Professor Jack Cuzick \(Queen Mary University of London\), and Professor Jeff Tobias \(University College London\). The ATAC study showed that in early post\-menopausal breast cancer, anastrozole, an AI, was superior to tamoxifen alone in preventing recurrence and distant recurrence of breast cancer **\(Ref. 1\)**. 

 **Translational research for ATAC trial.** Professor Dowsett led the translational research committee for the ATAC trial \(TransATAC\), and his team created the tissue collection of >2,000 tumour blocks from the trial. This material formed the basis of important translational research to determine biomarker profiles to identify endocrine therapy\-treated patients who could avoid cytotoxic chemotherapy. Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score \(hereafter referred to as Oncotype DX\) is designed to quantify the 10\-year risk of distant recurrence and predict relative treatment effects for chemotherapy. The performance of the Oncotype DX had not been previously evaluated in patients treated with an AI. Using the TransATAC samples the Dowsett team demonstrated for the first time that Oncotype DX can independently predict distant recurrence in ER\+ patients treated with anastrozole **\(Ref. 2\)**. These data was utilised for the NICE and NHS England approvals \(see *Section 4*\). 

 **Predicting risk of distant recurrence after endocrine therapy.** While conducting this work, the team, working with Professor Cuzick, created a much simpler IHC4 immunohistochemical test which provides more information than Oncotype DX at approximately 10% of the cost **\(Ref. 3\)**. Meanwhile, an independent approach emerged, which uses a risk of recurrence \(ROR\) score generated from the 50\-gene PAM50 test \(Prosigna\). Professor Dowsett’s team, using TransATAC samples, then showed that PAM50/ROR provides more prognostic information in endocrine\-treated patients with ER\+, node\-negative disease than Oncotype DX. They also found that the ROR score provides at least as much information as IHC4 and may provide more information in the node\-negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \(HER2\)\-negative group **\(Ref. 4\)**. The team went on to show that another test, Endopredict, also provided more prognostic information than Oncotype DX. 

 Building on this significant work, Professor Dowsett worked with individuals from the relevant companies to compare the performance of the 6 prognostic signatures for ER\+ breast cancer: Oncotype DX, PAM50/ROR, Breast Cancer Index \(BCI\), EndoPredict, Clinical Treatment Score, and IHC4 immunohistochemical test. The Dowsett team showed that all signatures performed similarly during the first 5 years of follow\-up, however, for women with node\-negative disease, the PAM50/ROR, BCI and EPclin tests were significantly more prognostic than the other tests in years 5 to 10, a period of time when decisions are made with regard to extending endocrine treatment **\(Ref. 5\)**. 

 **CDK4/6 inhibition in ER\+ breast cancer.** Resistance to endocrine therapies remains a significant clinical challenge in metastatic breast cancer, and there is a need for therapeutic strategies that overcome this resistance and potentially prolong patient survival. Based on preclinical data from ICR researchers, ICR Team Leader Professor Nicholas Turner, designed and led PALOMA\-3, a randomised phase 3 study of palbociclib sponsored by Pfizer. Palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of the cyclin\-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, which complex with cyclin D to allow cell cycle progression. This phase 3 study showed that women taking palbociclib with hormone therapy lived for 34.9 months on average, 6.9 months longer than those on hormone treatment alone. The drug’s benefit was stronger in women who had previously responded to hormone therapy—who lived 10 months longer with the combination treatment \(39.7 months versus 29.7 months\). The group of women given the combination treatment also saw a longer delay until the start of chemotherapy **\(Ref. 6** and **Ref. 7\)**. 

 **Ongoing work to improve outcomes for ER\+ breast cancer.** Building on our previous prognostic and therapeutic research, the ICR’s Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit, directed by Professor Judith Bliss are conducting the POETIC, PALLET and POETIC\-A trials. Professor Dowsett and Professor Bliss conducted the POETIC trial in 4,480 patients across the UK who received two weeks perioperative aromatase inhibitor or no perioperative therapy. This study showed that measuring Ki67 levels at surgery and two weeks after starting AI treatment segregated patients into groups with high or low risk of recurrence. Measuring Ki67 levels is a simple and cost\-effective test and it could be incorporated into routine practice on the NHS. Moreover, the ICR\-led PALLET trial \(Chief Investigator: Professor Stephen Johnston\) showed neo\-adjuvant treatment with palbociclib and letrozole, an AI, in early breast cancer significantly enhanced the suppression of cancer cell proliferation, yet did not increase tumour shrinkage as determined by clinical ultrasound. The findings from the POETIC trial are continuing to drive national research with the team’s launch of the UK\-wide POETIC\-A trial in which patients with high Ki67 on AI treatment will be randomised to the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor or not, stratified by a biomarker test, building on PAM50 work by Professor Dowsett and Dr Maggie Cheang \(Co\-inventor of Prosigna\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There are approximately 55,000 new breast cancer cases in the UK every year making it the most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 15% of all new cancer cases \(2016\). 

 **Impact of ATAC trial on breast cancer patients and clinical practice.** The results of the ATAC trial **\(Ref. 1\)** led to a rapid change in practice: receiving full marketing approval from the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) in 2004 and NICE approval in 2006. AIs have remained the international standard of care for early breast cancer in post\-menopausal women since that time \(2013 to 2020 inclusive\). Five years of an AI reduces 10\-year breast cancer mortality rates by approximately 40% compared with 30% with tamoxifen. Anastrozole causes significantly fewer side effects than tamoxifen. Between 2013 and 2017 there were over 13,200,000 prescriptions of anastrazole \(Arimidex\) in the United States alone showing the huge number of patients benefitting from this therapy **\[A\]**. 

 **Use of the prognostic tests on the NHS.** In September 2013, NICE recommended Oncotype DX as a test for some breast cancer patients in order to predict risk of cancer spread and to determine the need of chemotherapy. This recommendation was based on data from Professor Dowsett’s work **\(Ref. 3\)** and at the time Dr Carole Longson, director of NICE’s health technology evaluation centre, said: 

 *“Breast cancer patients face significant emotional and psychological strain when considering chemotherapy. A test that can help to predict better the risk of the breast cancer spreading, and therefore the potential likely benefit of additional chemotherapy, represents a significant step forward for patients.""* **\[B\]** 

 Following the 2013 guidance, NICE also included Oncotype DX in the updated Breast Cancer Quality Standard in June 2016 and their Breast Cancer Pathway in September 2017. As a result, over 95% of NHS trusts have adopted Oncotype DX and helped more than 22,000 patients benefit from making personalised chemotherapy treatment decisions **\[C\]**. 

 In 2018, NICE reviewed the available evidence and determined that EndoPredict, Oncotype DX and PAM50/ROR are recommended as options for guiding adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for people with ER\+, HER2\-negative and lymph node \(LN\)\-negative cancer. The main source of UK evidence was a bespoke analysis of data from the TransATAC study \(led by Professor Dowsett\). The recommendation of these tests allows more accurate determination of the patients with early breast cancer that have a low risk of distant recurrence by a tumour profiling test and thus could not gain significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. By omitting chemotherapy treatment the associated comorbidities and negative effects on quality of life can be avoided. This recommendation allows people with breast cancer and clinicians to have more confidence that the treatment they are having or recommending is appropriate to the individual **\[C\]**. 

 **Use of the prognosis tests internationally.** Professor Dowsett’s validation of the Onctoype DX for both tamoxifen and anastrozole provided evidence for healthcare systems across the world to recognise the value of Oncotype DX, which is incorporated in all major international clinical guidelines such as St. Gallen, the European Society for Medical Oncology and the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network \(NCCN\) **\[D\]**. Moreover, in April 2016, the American Society of Clinical Oncology released a clinical practice guideline recommending the use of Oncotype DX, EndoPredict and PAM50/ROR. The study described in **Ref. 3** was one of 12 studies that underpinned these guidelines **\[E\]**. The Oncotype DX test is currently reimbursed by public healthcare systems in 8 countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland. More than 900,000 patients in over 90 countries around the world have used the Oncotype DX test to inform their treatment decisions **\[D\]**. 

 The PAM50/ROR test, marketed as the Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay by Nanostring, was approved by the FDA in September 2013 with the study in **Ref. 4** quoted in the press release. The Prosigna Assay has been CE\-marked in 2012 and is available for use by healthcare professionals in the European Union and other countries that recognize the CE mark such as Canada, Israel, Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand **\[F\]**. \(Oncotype DX does not have a CE mark/FDA approval because it is provided as a service by Genomic Health\). 

 **Commercial impact.** Arimidex \(anastrozole\) was developed by AstraZeneca and between 2014 and 2019 it totalled USD1,434,000,000 in sales. In December 2019 AstraZeneca agreed to sell the commercial rights to Arimidex in a number of European, African and other countries to Juvisé Pharmaceuticals. Juvisé Pharmaceuticals has made an upfront payment of USD181,000,000 to AstraZeneca and may also make future sales\-contingent payments of up to USD17,000,000. Arimidex had lost its compound patent protection in these countries and AstraZeneca already divested the rights to both Arimidex and Casodex in the US in 2017 **\[G\]**. 

 Oncotype DX is now marketed by Exact Sciences, who in 2019 acquired Genomic Health, Inc., the company that initially marketed the test. Speaking about the acquisition, Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences stated: *“Genomic Health's Oncotype DX is the global standard of care to inform treatment decisions for women with breast cancer.”* **\[H\]** 

 **Palbociclib and fulvestrant combination in breast cancer.** Based on data from the PALOMA\-3 study **\(Ref. 6\)** in February 2016 the FDA approved palbociclib \(Ibrance\) in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of ER\+, HER2\-negative advanced breast cancer in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. The European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) approval in this indication followed in November 2016. As of May 2020, palbociclib is approved in more than 95 countries and has been prescribed to more than 300,000 patients globally **\[I\]**. 

 Palbociclib has been reviewed for use on the NHS in combination with fulvestrant. Pfizer offered palbociclib free to the NHS for 5 months during the initial review in 2017 under the ‘Ibrance Patient Programme’. In July 2019, the Scottish Medicines Consortium announced that palbociclib would be available on the NHS in Scotland in combination with fulvestrant in women who have received prior endocrine therapy and in November 2019, it was approved for use in England via the Cancer Drugs Fund in the same indication **\[J\]**. Palbocicib has generated significant economic impact for Pfizer. Since palbociclib’s first approval it has led to sales of USD14,340,000,000 with its biggest year of sales in 2019 \(USD4,961,000,000\) **\[K\]**.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Leeds Beckett University Cyber Security Innovation Centre led on the CARI Project, working with West Yorkshire Police \(WYP\), the fourth largest police force, to understand and improve policing of cybercrime. This has had lasting impact by 1\) informing and influencing planning and policing practice: informing a rethinking of the way police handle cybercrime investigations, including the role of the Digital Media Investigator becoming a more prominent role within investigations; 2\) increasing awareness and understanding of cybercrime within the force: our research triggered local and national discussion around strategic planning and police roles and their relation to cybercrime, and provided training and skills for participating police; 3\) providing new technical capabilities to the police: including grooming chat log parsing, and photo image processing.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The Police Knowledge Fund **CARI Project** was a large\-scale collaboration between the Cybercrime and Security Innovation Centre \(CSI Centre\) at Leeds Beckett University \(LBU\) and West Yorkshire Police \(WYP\). The CARI Project was designed to improve and incorporate an evidence\-based approach into the policing of digital forensics and cybercrime investigations. The academic lead for the CARI Project was Dr Z. Cliffe Schreuders, CSI Centre Director, working closely with DI Vanessa Smith, Head of Cybercrime at WYP. The CARI Project was funded **£640,000** by the Police Knowledge Fund \(PKF\), from The College of Policing, the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Home Office, and took place from 2015 to 2017. 

 An extensive needs assessment of UK policing and cybercrime and digital evidence was conducted to understand the current situation, and to identify needs across the force. The needs assessment was conducted within West Yorkshire Police, the fourth largest force in England and Wales, involving focus groups and interviews with police staff and strategic leads across key units and roles, in the largest study of its kind to date. This work identified and provided key insights into issues facing policing of cybercrime, across the force and in specific units and roles. 

 We produced a detailed report for internal police use, and published an academic paper “Needs Assessment of Cybercrime and Digital Evidence in a UK Police Force” in the International Journal of Cyber Criminology \(IJCC\). 

 The CARI Project also involved implementing a training and research programme. We provided training in research methods, to the entire Digital Forensics Unit, and the Cyber Crime Team within WYP. This needs assessment and research training led to the development of a set of research proposals, which were scored and selected with an emphasis on impact for policing. Subsequently, 12 LBU academics and 5 WYP police staff co\-produced nine research and development workstreams. Each of these collaborative projects was designed to address needs within law enforcement \(with pathways to impact designed in\). Outputs included evidence\-based procedures, new capabilities such as software/algorithms, and actionable intelligence. All of these workstreams included research findings and outputs targeted at addressing police needs, some of which were the basis for academic publications. 

 “Police Cybercrime Training: Perceptions, Pedagogy and Policy,” presents our examination of the cyber training that police receive, published in Policing: A Journal of Policy and Practice, Oxford University Press. “Understanding Cybercrime Victimisation: Modelling The Local Area Variations in Routinely Collected Cybercrime Police Data Using Latent Class Analysis” presents statistical analysis profiling of victims of cybercrime in Yorkshire. “Reinforced Source Camera Identification Using Non\-decimated Wavelet Transform” and “Source Camera Identification using Non\-decimated Wavelet Transform” proposes and evaluates a novel technique for identifying the digital camera used to take a photograph. Each of these papers describe findings and outputs that were provided to police.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The **CARI Project** has resulted in many practical impacts on UK policing of cybercrime. As described in Section 2, the project was specifically **designed to produce impact** by starting the project with an extensive needs assessment to determine the police’s institutional requirements and areas of interest and concern, both operational and strategic, in relation to cybercrime. Arising from this, and following a prioritisation and selection process based on impact, research workstreams worked to provide solutions to identified needs. 

 Working collaboratively, research projects were conducted to **co\-produce new knowledge and technical solutions**. Produced knowledge and software has been tested by, presented to, and reviewed by police at operational and strategic levels, informing strategic planning and decisions, and integrating tools and techniques into the available tool\-set for operational policing. 

 Our *first claim of impact*, is that the new knowledge has provided police in strategic positions with information that has **informed and influenced planning and policing practice**. The effect of which is observed in WYP, the fourth largest police force with over 17,000 police officers, and 5 districts covering 2,029 km<sup>2</sup>. The needs assessment highlighted many issues, many of which have been subsequently addressed or have active action plans in West Yorkshire Police’s strategic plans. As detailed in the testimony of the then Head of Cybercrime, Vanessa Smith, our research “has provided evidence that informed strategic decision making, including approaches we subsequently took to restructure our staffing around providing cyber support \(such as expanding the role of Digital Media Investigators and creating a national call takers flow chart\)”. 

 Based on the results from the needs assessment and a follow up workstream which conducted an evaluation of the Digital Media Investigator \(DMI\) role, an internal police paper was issued, resulting in direct action from the PCC to redefine how this role is now implemented within West Yorkshire Police, resulting in a restructuring of the policing roles within WYP. Based on these recommendations DMIs are now full\-time dedicated staff that take a much more prominent role within investigations, guiding and information digital aspects. DS Vanessa Smith has stated in testimony that “investigations are significantly improved by the additional capacity to make use of cyber elements”. 

 We presented statistical profiles on victims of types of cybercrime to leads within WYP to inform proactive policing \(including the identification of vulnerable geographical areas and hotspots that were identified\), and to benefit awareness raising work \(for example, young females were found to be particularly vulnerable to particular kinds of cybercrime, which can inform the messaging targeted at this demographic\). 

 The training team now has further insight into training methods that were perceived to be more effective for teaching cyber policing, and this has informed future training plans. Our results informed a Police Transformational Fund bid to reform the training provided by the police; although the bid was unsuccessful, this demonstrates that police partners are proactive in actioning the findings. 

 Updates and results from all the workstreams have been *disseminated at the highest strategic levels within the police force nationally*, including at the WYP Strategic Board on Cybercrime, chaired by Assistant Chief Constable Russ Foster, and attended by Police and Crime Commissioner \(PCC\) for West Yorkshire Mark Burns\-Williamson. The *invite\-only* CARI Project showcase conference event was well attended, with 70 delegates from law enforcement and academia, including senior decision makers and strategic leads from a variety of police forces. 100% of attendees reported finding the event useful, and all law enforcement in attendance reported that they were “interested in using any of the CARI project outputs within their own force/unit”. Senior representatives from the UK Police digital investigation and intelligence \(DII\) discussed taking results forward nationally. Subsequent meetings have taken place to discuss our findings and outputs with Detective Superintendent Andrew Gould, the National Cybercrime Programme Lead for the National Police Chiefs’ Council responsible for developing the police response to cybercrime at the national, regional and local level, and with Giles Herdale, the then Head of Digital Intelligence & Investigation Strategy. 

 Our *second claim of impact* is that our work resulted in **increased awareness and understanding within the force** across police units of the police roles, the importance of digital evidence in investigations, and use of research and evidence\-based practice. As Vanessa Smith stated in testimony: “Participating in the needs assessment exercise impacted on the way as a force we were considering cyber crime. It raised discussions at strategic level and locally within police teams \[...\] as a consequence there was an impact that made a lot of people think about  their own role and their connected roles to other departments”. The CARI Project demonstrably increased capability amongst officers and staff to understand, and conduct research: having successfully co\-produced research projects related to their police roles. Many police officers and staff \(all members of WYP’s digital forensic unit \(DFU\) and cyber crime team \(CCT\) staff\) received research training, and were involved in the design of research projects, enabling them to understand and critically evaluate research. Specialist police staff engaged fully in conducting research projects, gaining experience working on research and development. As described in the PKF review conducted by the College of Policing: “Academics at Leeds Beckett University related the content of their one\-day research methods programme delivered to West Yorkshire Police’s Digital Forensics and Cybercrime teams to the context of their specific projects, helping attendees to understand how the benefits of the research could be directly applied in their operational roles.” Stephen Miller, who leads the Regional Digital Forensics Unit \(RDFU\), within the Yorkshire & Humber Regional Organised Crime Unit \(ROCU\), in his testimony states that “involvement in CARI informed our thinking, and has led to an overall change in mindset”, and that as a result they now “investigate the research behind approaches we take, looking into background information, and how we can use this information to inform our decision making and problem solving.” 

 Our *third claim* is that impact has included new knowledge and understanding that has provided **new technical capabilities to the police**. The police now have a new tool, EWT, for quickly triaging chat logs to identify log files that include grooming behaviour, including the production of chat profiles of participants and filtering chats for messages of interest. Five UK police forces have been provided EWT, enabling them to more effectively investigate cases of child sexual exploitation \(CSE\). Amongst the forces that have requested the software, Dyfed\-Powys Police produced an independent evaluation report, which states “The software is very effective in processing mobile phone downloads in that all of the conversations that were previously detected through the manual process have been identified and highlighted. Additional conversations were also detected and these were able to be checked manually”. DFU also now has access to new tools and procedures to store and make use of SPN fingerprints of cameras, providing a new investigative technique for connecting cases of CSE, by linking new photo images to camera fingerprints. These new capabilities are all now available for police to use to progress and improve investigations.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Low power gas sensors have a broad and profitable range of applications, including environmental monitoring and usage in smart homes and personal healthcare devices. Based on research from the Universities of Warwick and Cambridge, the spin\-out Cambridge CMOS Sensors \(CCS\) was founded in 2008, with Warwick\-patented IP built into the flagship CCS801 and CCS811 air quality sensor ranges. By 2016 CSS had attracted over GBP8,000,000 investment, and was subsequently sold to form ams Sensors UK Ltd in a deal in excess of EUR31,000,000. Based on strong performance of ams Sensors UK, in 2019 the CCS technology was used by ams to create a joint venture named ScioSense, valued at approximately USD120,000,000. The original Warwick IP remains of strategic importance to the new multinational, allowing them to better penetrate the consumer smart home market worldwide through continuing strong sales of CCS801 and CCS811.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professors Julian Gardner and James Covington of the Sensors and Devices group in the Warwick School of Engineering, in collaboration with Professors Florin Udrea \(a former Warwick student\) and Bill Milne of the University of Cambridge, undertook research on gas sensors, published in 2001, which proposed a new generation of sensors embedded in SOI \(silicon on insulator\) micro\-hotplates, offering ultra\-low power consumption \(under 100 mW\), high sensitivity, low noise, low unit cost, reproducibility and reliability through the use of on\-chip integration **\[3.1\]**. 

 Between 2005 and 2011 the Warwick\-Cambridge partnership built on earlier work with their research into nano\-structured micro\-power smart gas sensors, with Alphasense \(UK\) as an industrial collaborator **\[G1\]**. The Warwick team developed the underlying circuitry of the SOI CMOS \(Complementary Metal\-Oxide Semiconductor – an on\-board, battery powered semiconductor chip inside computers that stores information\) device, using nested meandering resistors. The Cambridge team were responsible for aspects of the SOI component design, including the tungsten micro hot\-plate and a deep\-reactive ion etch process. 

 A core advantage of the sensor was the possibility of fabricating both the CMOS circuitry with the micro\-heater in a single step, greatly reducing the complexity of the manufacturing process due to the circuitry’s integration into the device. Warwick additionally played a vital role in testing the measurement capabilities of the prototypes, developing a test\-rig for gas sensing which could simulate different levels of humidity, heat the sensor and maintain appropriate pressures of different gases. This proprietary technology was incorporated into two patents filed at Warwick in 2005 and granted in 2009 and 2010 respectively, which protected the key innovative single step fabrication of a SOI or CMOS gas sensing device with its electronic circuitry **\[3.2\-3.3\]**. 

 The devices were designed to detect ethanol, H<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, and benzene\-related hydrocarbons \(collectively known as VOC, or volatile organic compounds\), with lower power consumption, more accurate temperature control and order of magnitude improved sensitivity to gases when compared with silicon micro\-electro\-mechanical system \(MEMS\) devices **\[3.4\-3.6\]**. 

 The research outcomes include innovative use of materials and proprietary designs such as CMOS\-compatible tungsten for the thermal wire, gold for electrodes, and ultra\-high temperature SOI diodes for temperature sensing **\[3.1, 3.4\-3.5\]**. The physical properties of the tungsten metal layer provide a high melting point and resistance against electro migration but also CMOS compatibility \(the main technology in the microelectronics industry\). This is a clear advantage over competitors using platinum heaters. 

 The resulting platform incorporates temperature, gas, humidity, pressure and flow sensors. The research also covered fabrication, involving two major steps: \(i\) a microelectronics process, which ensures compatibility with integrated circuit processing and on\-chip drive and read\-out circuits, and \(ii\) membrane formation using deep reactive ion etching. Both steps have been integrated in a single commercial foundry. **\[3.1, 3.4\]** 

 From 2011 to 2016, during which time CCS was acquired by ams \(Austria\), Gardner and Udrea continued research, together with CCS / ams and others, into smart SOI sensing systems operating at high temperature \(SOI\-HITS\), in a collaborative project in the EU FP7 programme **\[G2\]**. This research focused on a micro\-inkjet printing technique for the deposition of carbon nanoparticles and fullerene adlayers onto SOI infrared light sources to enhance their infrared emission. The work showed a significant increase in the infrared emission efficiency of the coated emitters, and a 90% improvement in IR emission power density. Built\-in electronic interfaces enabled the sensors to work in harsh, high\-temperature \(225°C\) environments, compared to 125°C for conventional sensors **\[3.7\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 To exploit patented innovations from both Warwick and Cambridge, Cambridge CMOS Sensors \(CCS\) was founded by Julian Gardner \(Warwick\) along with Florin Udrea and Bill Milne \(Cambridge\) in August 2008 with seed investment from the University of Cambridge and Cambridge Angels. A shareholding was released for Warwick through transfer of its IP \(patents **\[3.2\-3.3\]**, among others\) into the new spin\-out. From its inception in 2008, CCS grew to be one of the most successful physical sciences spin\-offs in Cambridge University’s history **\[A2\]**, producing a range of novel gas sensing solutions: 

 <ins> **Impact on technology and innovation: from big industry to small and smart wearables**</ins> 

 Gas sensor technology, patented by Warwick and developed from 2008 by CCS into the original CCS801 and CCS811 sensor ranges, is still in use to this day in the form of metal oxide \(MOX\) sensors to monitor indoor air quality **\[5.1\-5.2\]**. The technological advancements made in these sensors offered a radical improvement in performance over the competition, opening up multiple markets which were previously unserviceable **\[5.3\]**. Key features of this technology include **\[5.4\]**: 

-  Ultra\-low power consumption: the CCS811 requires 46 mW; the main competitor from Applied Sensors needs 100 mW. 

-  Very small form factor: it requires a module 1/10 in size compared to others. 

-  Cost advantage: it has a 50% to 90% cost advantage over the competition, enabling lowest unit cost. 

-  Multi\-sensor integration: full CMOS compatibility – this enables integration of additional sensor modalities like relative humidity, temperature and pressure, and other ‘on\-chip’ functions like amplifiers, and close loop control of temperature. 

-  Ease of volume manufacture: this is due to the use of standardised automated high\-volume semiconductor manufacturing processes, which also delivers high yields. 

 Initially, the markets for these sensors were industrial, medical and automotive, where the applications \(fibre optics, air cleaners and purifiers\) were in specialist equipment normally used by trained operators. Later, the tech was deployed in smart buildings and homes \(heating, ventilation and air conditioning, or HVAC, systems, cooker hoods\). Recently, a new range of MOX sensors have been developed which promise smaller sizes, lower prices, and embedded ‘intelligence’ for ease of use and integration, in a wide range of consumer\-oriented products \(handheld and portable devices such as smartphones and wearables\), with no special experience or knowledge needed by the end user. 

 Upon acquisition of CCS by ams in 2016 to create ams Sensors UK Ltd \(see Impact on commerce\), the company used this sector\-leading technology to attract new clients and break into advantageous marketplaces. Since August that year HiCling, the leading Chinese wearable device manufacturer, has used the CCS gas sensors to enable their Cling VOC smart fitness wristband to measure indoor air quality and alcohol in breath. When integrated in the Cling VOC wristband, the CCS801 gas sensor can detect low levels of volatile organic compounds \(VOCs\) typically found indoors – cigarette smoke or solvents, for example. These measurements provide an indication of air quality on the display. The wristband also provides alcohol breath analysis, as the sensor can detect ethanol on human breath. The small footprint and low profile of the CCS8xx family of gas sensors mean that they fit the slim and sleek design of the Cling VOC. Their ultra\-low power consumption and fast response times are also critical for wearable devices **\[5.5\]**. 

 Richard Chen, CEO of HiCling, stated that “ *ams group company CCS has developed the world’s smallest and lowest\-power MOX gas sensors on the market…  Most people spend most of their time indoors, so it is important that they are able to monitor air quality easily and to take appropriate action – something that wearers of the Cling VOC wristband can now do*” **\[5.5\]** 

 <ins> **Impact on commerce: from small seed\-funded spinout to leading global manufacturer**</ins> 

 By 2014, under the strong leadership of Gardner as Chief Technology Officer \(CTO\) and Udrea as Chief Executive Officer \(CEO\), CCS had become an industry leader in advanced sensor solutions, providing sensor technology across multiple global markets with high\-volume supply chains **\[5.3\]**. Over the next 2 years CCS increased its staff to 33, moved to larger offices within Cambridge, and – after establishing a customer base in the Greater China region – opened an office in Taiwan in 2015 **\[5.3, 5.6\]**. Between June 2013 and December 2015 with excitement building around the spin\-out’s technological offering, CCS attracted GBP8,000,000 from investors, with the IP from original Warwick patents **\[3.2\-3.3\]** being integral to this investment **\[5.1, 5.7\]**. 

 Later that year, ams – an Austrian\-based multinational specialising in sensor technology and sensor solutions – acquired CCS to form ams Sensors UK Ltd. While the total multimillion euro sales price remains undisclosed, as part of the deal ams committed to pay profit\-dependent purchase price share of up to EUR31,000,000 \(06\-2016\), based on sales of CCS technology up to 2020 as an earn\-out provision **\[5.8\]**. On the significant value added to ams from the acquisition, Alexander Everke, CEO of ams, stated: “ *The addition of \[CCS\] … completes ams’ portfolio of products and technologies for the environmental sensor market. This highly strategic acquisition is therefore another key step in making ams the world’s leading provider of sensor solutions for consumer, automotive, industrial, and medical applications*” **\[5.6\]**. The former Senior Director of Engineering at ams Sensors UK Ltd stated that the CCS801 and CCS811 ranges – inseparable from the original Warwick IP – were “ *at the heart of the ams acquisition of CCS”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Between 2016 and 2019 ams Sensors UK achieved a respectable turnover of approximately GBP5,500,000 **\[5.9\]**, with sales of CCS801 and CCS811 being fundamental to this success **\[5.1\]**. Based on a unit price of GBP2.95 \(incl. VAT\) for bulk purchases of CCS801 **\[5.10\]**, this represents approximately 1,850,000 unit sales over the four\-year period. Later in 2019, Wise Road Capital – a global private equity firm specialising in emerging high\-tech industries – created a joint venture with ams called ScioSense \(Netherlands\), valued at approximately USD120,000,000 \(03\-2019\) **\[5.11\]**. A key element of Wise Road Capital wanting to set up the venture was the perceived value of the CCS801 and CCS811 ranges **\[5.1\]**. Overall, ScioSense brought together the IP, employees and sensor products of ams Sensors UK and other parts of the ams group **\[5.2\]**. 

 In 2020, ScioSense has surpassed the successes of CCS and ams Sensors UK, employing over 100 staff, with offices in four countries \(China, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands\) and a network of distributors in Europe, Asia and the US. A world leader in environmental and flow sensing technology, the company provides across the automotive, industrial, consumer goods and environmental markets to OEMs, Tier 1s, Tier 2s and more **\[5.2\]**. 

 CCS801 and CCS811 continue to add value to the company, with both sensor ranges supporting jobs and being sold in “ *considerable volumes*” up to the end of 2020. Further, they are strategically important to ScioSense’s product portfolio, allowing it to penetrate the consumer home automation and building automation \(smart home and office\) markets more successfully than they could do otherwise **\[5.2\]**. R&D based on the original IP **\[3.2\-3.3\]** remains active in ScioSense and important to the company’s future, with their CTO confirming, “ *Further sensor ranges are currently under development based in part on these original patents, which are expected sell in multimillion quantities in the coming years starting in 2021*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 Overall, the journey from Cambridge CMOS Sensors through to ams Sensors UK and then onto ScioSense marks a story of award\-winning and lucrative entrepreneurship with its roots in academic collaboration. Continuing development and sales based on university IP, in the words of the former Senior Director of Engineering of ams Sensors UK, is an indication of its “ *enduring value”* **\[5.1\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Based upon University of Manchester \(UoM\) research, the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle, a quality improvement programme to identify and manage risk factors for stillbirth, has been implemented nationally. Implementation reduced stillbirth by 20% in all 19 NHS Trust early adopter units, saving 161 stillbirths in these units. In 2019/20, implementation of the care bundle was incorporated into the standard NHS contract. UoM studies describing women’s experiences after stillbirth and in pregnancies after loss have underpinned regional, national and international guidelines for the care of women who experience a stillbirth. Public awareness campaigns based upon our research including \#sleeponside and \#movementsmatter have reached >2,500,000 women in the UK and internationally. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2014, the UK stillbirth rate ranked in the lowest third of high\-income countries at 1 in 219 births, with 3,563 stillbirths occurring in the UK in 2014.The National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit’s Listening to Parents report \(2014\) found that whilst quality of care for bereaved parents was generally good, there were gaps in care and variability between services. Changes were needed both to improve stillbirth rates in UK and to better help families deal with the loss of a baby. 

 UoM research has focussed on three main themes: i\) understanding of conditions associated with stillbirth, ii\) identifying risk factors for stillbirth and iii\) using this information to improve the quality of clinical care to prevent stillbirths and enhance the quality of care following a stillbirth. 

 In the first theme, UoM researchers conducted basic scientific studies to demonstrate placental dysfunction in women with an increased risk of stillbirth including: fetal growth restriction, maternal obesity, women with a perceived reduction in fetal movements, maternal diabetes and mothers over 40 years of age. This has provided a crucial scientific basis to associate these risk factors with stillbirth \[1\]. Heazell also undertook systematic reviews to demonstrate the frequency and significance of placental lesions as a cause of stillbirth \[2\]. As a result, there is now an established link between risk factors, placental dysfunction and stillbirth. 

 Since 2010 UoM has developed “research clinics” to better identify placental dysfunction in women at high\-risk of fetal growth restriction including women whose previous pregnancies were complicated by fetal growth restriction, hypertension or stillbirth. UoM researchers used these clinics to develop and test clinical algorithms to improve outcomes for mothers and babies and have conducted national multicentre studies to investigate the impact of better screening and treatment for fetal growth restriction and management of reduced fetal movements. 

 Heazell led the largest case\-control study of novel risk factors for stillbirth \(Midlands and North of England Stillbirth Study, n=1,035\) which demonstrated an independent association between maternal going\-to\-sleep position and late stillbirth \[3\]. UoM’s subsequent collaboration in an international individual patient data meta\-analysis identified underpinning mechanisms. The UoM team were co\-investigators on the AFFIRM study the largest ever clinical trial of the management of reduced fetal movements \(n=409,175\), leading site visits, writing the protocol, analysing and disseminating study findings \[4\]. This study provided important data emphasising the importance of testing, after women attend with reduced movements, as detection of small infants \(compared to gestational age\) improved, but also indicated that unwarranted intervention may increase Caesarean section without clear benefit. 

 Heazell’s mixed\-methods study was the first to describe bereaved parents’ experiences in the UK for over 20 years. This study has provided evidence for effective care practices and those that were detrimental to parents \[5\]. In addition, these studies demonstrated barriers and facilitators to post\-mortem consent in women who have had a stillbirth, allowing care to be restructured and optimised to maximise the information obtained for parents about the cause of their baby’s death \[6\]. Heazell’s systematic review of care in pregnancies after stillbirth and cross\-sectional studies describing care in pregnancies after stillbirth in the UK has led to leadership and generation of an international consensus statement for the care of women in pregnancies after stillbirth. This body of evidence has made a significant contribution to data regarding parents’ experiences following the death of their baby.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Pathways to impact 

-  **Parliamentary POST notes:** UoM research cited informing MPs about stillbirth issues \(POSTbrief 21 July 2016, Bereavement Care, POSTNOTE 527, May 2016, Infant Mortality and Stillbirth in the UK\). 

-  **Heazell presented to All Party Parliamentary Group on Baby Loss \(2016\):** Co\-chair described Manchester’s hospitals as displaying best practice with their stillbirth\-specific integrated pathway. 

-  **Patient guidance:** UoM research informed patient\-information leaflets from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists \(RCOG\), Kick’s Counts, Tommy’s \(for NHS England\), StillAware \(Australian charity\) and \#movementsmatter campaign \(published 24 Oct 2016, >65,100 YouTube views\). 

-  **International \#sleeponside campaign:** Launched in 2018, by Tommy’s, to educate mothers about sleeping position in late pregnancy \[3\]. Tommy’s estimate this reached >2,500,000 women globally. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

###  **20% reduction in stillbirth followed Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle’s introduction in 19 UK early adopter trusts** 

 In 2014, NHS England launched the four element Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle. The third element focussing on Reduced Fetal Movements was authored by Heazell and underpinned by UoM research \[Ai\]. In 2018, UoM conducted the SPiRE study to determine the bundle’s impact on pregnancy outcomes. Stillbirths were reduced by 20% over the implementation period \(2015\-2017\) \[Aii\]. UoM’s findings informed the bundle’s second iteration \(released March 2019\) which included the sleep on side message \[Ai, 4\]. National Clinical Director for Maternity and Women’s Health, NHS England noted, “ *Heazell’s research contribution was an important factor in allowing us to make these positive changes. In my view, the development and subsequent evaluation is an excellent example of how translational research can be used to effect positive change in NHS services*” \[B\]. Implementing the bundle was included in NHS planning guidance and incorporated into the standard NHS contract for 2019/20. 

###  Influence on Australian Safer Baby Bundle 

 UoM findings influenced the Australian Safer Baby Bundle \(SBB\), launched in 2019. Heazell was an international advisor. SBB handbook states it is *“based on the approach used in the UK Bundle Versions One and Two*” \[Ci,3,4\]. Victoria’s Secretary of Department of Health and Human Services confirmed, “ *There is no question that we would not have been able to develop the Safer Baby Bundle without the resources and insights…generously shared by Professor Heazell…an example of how sharing research insights can rapidly enable application internationally*”. He confirmed, “ *initial evaluation of the care bundle in 21 Victorian maternity services is that it has been associated with a reduction in stillbirth by 27%”* \[Cii\] *.* 

###  National/international clinical guidance 

 UoM reduced fetal movements work was cited as best practice in: guidance from RCOG \(reviewed 2014 and  2017\) \[Di\]; Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand \[Dii\]; American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \[Diii\]; national Perinatal Confidential Enquiries into stillbirth \(2015 \[Ei\], 2017 \[Eii\]\). 

###  Creation of North West Regional Stillbirth Care Pathway 

 Initiated in 2014/5, updated in 2018, UoM’s research was cited in North\-West regional stillbirth care pathway guidelines \[5,6,Fi, Fii\]. A pathway audit in August 2016 demonstrated 25% more women were: receiving information; being cared for in labour more safely; and accessing investigations to determine the cause of stillbirth \[Fiii\]. 

###  Creation of National Perinatal Post Mortem Consent Package and Bereavement Care Pathway 

 In January 2013, Sands \(Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Charity\) launched a perinatal post mortem consent package and training programme. Sands confirmed Heazell’s *“research informed the development of the...package and substantially aided our efforts in producing this important resource, which benefits both health professionals and parents*” \[G,6\]. A 2016 maternity unit audit of UK’s bereavement care provision demonstrated 52 UK Trusts use the package and, of these, 85% believed it had improved staff confidence \[H\]. 

 In 2017, Sands launched a national bereavement care pathway \(NBCP\) and audit tools, stating UoM “ *research into post\-mortem consent, the value of investigations and parent’s experiences following stillbirth was instrumental in informing Sands as we developed and launched the…documents*” \[G,5\]. A 2020 NBCP progress report documented, within the pilot sites, that 76% of professionals aware of the pathway agreed that bereavement care improved during the pilot \[I\]. The pathway was rolled out nationally in October 2018. Sands confirmed, by August 2020, 52% of English sites have fully committed to NBCP and 99% have engaged with NBCP in some way \[G\]. Additionally 5 Scottish NHS Boards are currently piloting the NBCP as early adopters \[G\]. 

 In 2014, ‘Listening to Parents after Stillbirth’ reported only half of women whose baby died before labour felt involved in decision making and confident about decisions made at the time. By contrast, NBCP’s 2020 progress report found 89% felt decisions they made in hospital were the right ones at the time, 89% felt communication was sensitive and they received information about relevant support organisations. 92% agreed they were treated with respect \[I\], demonstrating NBCP’s positive impact for these parents. 

###  Improved care delivered in pregnancies after stillbirth 

 A clinic model for care in pregnancies after stillbirth was developed from UoM’s systematic review of women and families’ needs in these pregnancies. Over 800 families have been treated at Manchester’s Rainbow Clinic since January 2014, which provides specialist care for pregnant women who have previously had a stillbirth and supports partners and family. It was cited in a Parliamentary debate as an example of excellent care \[Ji\]. 

 Manchester’s Rainbow Clinic has improved clinical outcomes. A 2016 review showed it had reduced: preterm birth \(10% *vs* 21%\); and low birthweight infant numbers \(9% *vs* 18%\) \[Jii\]. An independent study by NEF Consulting found clinic attendance reduced anxiety and post\-natal depression \[Jiii\]. It also demonstrated the Rainbow Clinic gave tangible healthcare financial benefits of GBP6.10 of benefit per pound invested solely from clinical outcomes \[Jiii\]. 

 Twelve satellite Rainbow Clinics have opened in the UK to date, delivering the UoM care model with a further 25 in development. Further afield, UoM researchers are working with care providers wishing to adopt the model in Melbourne \(Australia\), Toronto \(Canada\) and Wisconsin \(USA\).

#  1 Summary of the impact 

 The University of Liverpool’s \(UoL\) *Marine Management Group* develops ecosystem\-based measures to safeguard the world’s seas and oceans and enable sustainable maritime development. Our research has led to change in policy and practice by \(1\) mobilising stakeholders for the governance of the Irish Sea, and \(2\) developing tools for implementing national marine legislation. Specifically \(1\): enabled the creation of **10 Marine Conservation Zones** in English waters, protecting vulnerable species; and established the **Irish Sea Maritime Forum** which works for the integrated governance of the Irish Sea. \(2\): Dutch and Irish agencies and the intergovernmental body for the Northeast Atlantic are using our approach to prioritise management needed under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, leading to **improved environmental status of national waters**; and South Africa is following our procedure for marine spatial planning in the **Eastern Cape marine area**. 
","
#  2 Underpinning research 

 The world’s seas and oceans are under pressure from climate change, pollution and growing human demands. Our research aims to improve human interaction with the sea, bringing the social and natural sciences into direct engagement with government and wider society. 

 Our research began with the interdisciplinary ESRC/NERC seminar series *New Approaches to Managing Ecosystem Services in the Marine Environment* \( **NAMESME**\), coordinated by Kidd \(09/2007\-08/2010\). This involved 5 seminars bringing together UK academics from the natural and social sciences, along with marine planning and management stakeholders. Discussion in these seminars drew out novel connections between marine planning and 100 years of terrestrial spatial planning experience \(3.1\). 

 Kidd led a follow\-on ESRC Knowledge Exchange award *Partnership Working in Support of Marine Spatial Planning in the Irish Sea* \( **MSPIrishSea**\) \(09/2010\-08/2011\). This dealt with the complex regional arrangements for new systems of marine planning, covering 6 national jurisdictions with separate agencies and marine stakeholders. Kidd subsequently led UoL input to the European Commission \(EC\) \(LIFE\) project *Celtic Seas Partnership* \( **CSP**\) \(01/2013\-04/2017\) which developed transboundary cooperation for implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Kidd also developed thinking in stakeholder engagement in marine management through academic publications \(e.g. 3.2\), stressing the need for equitable and representative participation. 

 Robinson led the EC projects \(FP7\) *Options for Delivering Ecosystem\-based Marine Management* \( **ODEMM**\) \(03/2010\-12/2013\) and \(Horizon 2020\) *Knowledge, Assessment and Management for Aquatic Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services* \( **AQUACROSS**\) \(06/2015\-11/2018\). A tool was developed to measure human pressures on regional seas, taking into account ecological risk and potential for recovery \(3.3\). This enables users to evaluate their management options for reducing environment impacts and see the potential for achieving their obligations under the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive, over policy time frames \(3.4\). 

 Jay and Kidd led three EC projects *Transboundary Planning in the European Atlantic* \( **TPEA**\) \(12/2012\-02/2015\) *Supporting Implementation of the Maritime Spatial Planning Directive in the Celtic Seas* \( **SIMCelt**\) \(12/2016\-02/2018\), and *Supporting Implementation in the Atlantic* \( **SIMAtl**\) \(07/2019–06/2021\). These stressed that ecosystem\-based marine management and planning require not just technical solutions, but also integration with legislative and policy frameworks and the close involvement of stakeholder communities \(3.5\). These projects led to recommen\-dations for linking marine spatial planning \(MSP\) to wider political structures and priorities \(3.6\).

#  4 Details of the impact 

 Coastal nations around the world face the challenge of historic misuse of their seas and the consequences of climate change on the oceans. We have worked directly with government agencies and stakeholders to develop practices to manage marine resources in a more sustainable way. These practices have been internalised by organisations which are now carrying them forward in the implementation of national and international policy. This is producing material outcomes in four marine areas: the Irish Sea, the North Sea, the Northeast Atlantic and South Africa’s seas. We have changed the way that agencies and stakeholders act, specifically under two themes. 

##  4.1    Mobilisation of Stakeholders in the Governance of the Irish Sea 

 Good marine ecosystem\-based management needs effective communication between government and stakeholders, ensuring knowledge transfer and better implementation of policy. We have brought stakeholders into the heart of governance of the Irish Sea in two areas of work. 

###  4.1.a   <ins>Stakeholder\-info</ins><ins>rmed Marine Conservation Zones</ins> 

 A programme for designating Marine Conservation Zones \(MCZs\) in English waters began in 03/2010 to protect habitats and species that are important, rare or under threat \(under Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009\). Regional stakeholder groups were tasked with proposing MCZs. 

 Kidd was brought in as independent chair of the Irish Sea Conservation Zones board \(03/2010\-04/2012\), leveraging her knowledge from project work \( **NAMEME** and **MSPIrishSea**\) and expertise in stakeholder\-led approaches \(3.1\). As noted by a water management company Director \(5.1.a\), “Without Sue’s oversight… the Project would have suffered delays in delivery and a lower overall quality of recommendations”. Stakeholders \(such as offshore renewables, fishing, shipping, recreation and conservation\) were “reminded of their obligation to work together, focusing on their common vision rather than their own individual interests”. 

 These pre\-2014 activities provided the essential capacity for subsequent impact. Crucially, the board recommended 15 MCZs, of which 10, covering 1,309km<sup>2</sup>, were finally designated in 2019 \(5.2.a, 5.2.b\), and for which management measures are now being put in place. For example, the Cumbria Coast MCZ stretches along 27km, protecting 8 key features, including honeycomb worm reefs and rocky habitats; it includes England’s only breeding colony of black guillemots which are now protected from fishing nets during the nesting season thanks to a voluntary netting ban brought in as an MCZ measure \(5.2.c\). 

###  4.1.b   <ins>Irish Sea Maritime Forum</ins> 

 As a result of **MSPIrishSea** \(3.2\) **,** Kidd led the formation of the Irish Sea Maritime Forum \(ISMF\) in 06/2012 \(5.3.a\). This is a partnership of government agencies, industry, and environmental stakeholders from across all six Irish Sea jurisdictions. A Science Advisor of Historic England testifies \(5.3.d\), “The Irish Sea Maritime Forum exists due to Sue’s initiative, vision, and leadership skills. Its successes are largely due to her ability to encourage stakeholders to work together”. The Manger of the NW Coastal Forum states \(5.3.c\), “One of the key … benefits of the Forum includes building stronger networks between Irish Sea users.” Its importance is reflected in high\-level political support; its current chair is a former Irish Senator \(5.3.e\). This has provided the platform for subsequent impact. 

 A 2018 stakeholder review demonstrated that ISMF provides the institutional structure needed to facilitate cooperative management of the Irish sea’s resources:  “The Irish Sea is a natural unit… There is a clear need for transboundary cooperation which is met by the ISMF” \(5.4.a\). 

 Activities between 01/2014 and 02/2020, including well\-attended conferences and stakeholder events \(5.3.b\), have benefitted members as revealed through a survey, for example \(5.4.c\): 

-  “Keeping up to date with all new development” \(Northern Ireland Government\) 

-  “Continued cooperation and understanding of issues/opportunities” \(UK Agency\) 

-  “Build capacity to respond to transnational issues” \(Fisheries industry\) 

-  “Having a wide range of stakeholders allows for better outcomes” \(Planning Authority\) 

 A former Liverpool Councillor states “decision makers, including myself, had our views changed and now, wind energy in the Irish Sea is a significant and growing economic and environmental benefit” \(5.4.e\). 

 In addition to these governance changes, impacts include: securing funding worth over €8 million for projects supporting EU Directives for environmental quality and marine planning; *Blue Growth Prospectus for the Irish Sea Region* 2015 setting out opportunities for shipping, blue energy, fisheries, blue biotechnology and tourism \(5.4.b\); and the Ireland\-Wales Interreg project *Ecostructure* that developed concepts for multi\-functional natural and hard sea defences \(5.4.d\). 

##  4.2 Application of Tools for Implementing National and Regional Marine Legislation 

 Marine ecosystem\-based management needs practical approaches that can be used to implement policy and legislation effectively. We have developed tools to enable national agencies to manage their marine resources in the context of two legislative frameworks: the EU’s Marine Strategy Framework Directive and South Africa’s Marine Spatial Planning Act. 

###  4.2.a    <ins>Marine Management Strategies in the Netherlands</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>Ireland</ins> <ins>and beyond</ins> 

 The EU’s 2008 *Marine Strategy Framework Directive* \(MSFD\) aims to address the deteriorating environmental conditions of European seas, requiring coastal Member States to achieve Good Environmental Status \(GES\) of their marine waters by 2020. However, there was no clear approach for reaching this target. Robinson led the **ODEMM** project that produced a *pressure assessment tool* \(3.3, 3.4\) which enables decision makers to identify the key human pressures acting on their marine ecosystems and to select the best measures for achieving GES \(5.5.a,\). 

 Government agencies have now applied this tool to advise governments in Ireland and the Netherlands. It was adopted in 2014 in Ireland to assess the threats to marine environmental status. This was the “first application of the ODEMM framework… completed for Ireland’s marine waters” \(5.6.b\). The findings were used to advise the Irish government on the selection of management measures which since 2018 have now been used to achieve recovery of Irish marine ecosystems. A Principal Investigator for Ireland’s Marine Institute confirms, “We have carried this out using the assessment approach …developed by Dr Robinson” \(5.6.a\). 

 In the Netherlands, the tool has been adapted to underpin selection of management measures in 2018\-20 which are now being used to achieve the GES objectives across Dutch marine waters and the broader North Sea. The Dutch principal Investigator on marine ecosystem\-based management states, “The risk\-based pressure assessment approach developed by Dr Robinson’s team is a really significant contribution to the field because it allows managers the ability to weigh up different options for sustainable use of marine ecosystems. Without this, single\-sector based approaches miss the significant effects of multiple pressures acting on marine species and habitats” \(5.6.c\). 

 The tool has also been used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea \(ICES\), an intergovernmental marine science organisation for the Northeast Atlantic \(5.7a\). The ODEMM tool is now a key part of the technical guidance for the ICES Ecosystem Overviews \(5.7b\), the first set of which were published in 2019\-20 and have affected decisions on ecosystem\-based management across the region over this time\-frame. The ICES Chair testifies, “Leonie’s work in the field of ecosystem\-based marine management has made a very significant contribution to the field both in Europe and across the broader Atlantic region” \(5.6a\). 

###  4.2.b    <ins>Marine Spatial Planning in South Africa</ins> 

 Marine spatial planning \(MSP\) has been introduced by many coastal nations to provide an integrated approach to regulated marine industries; it is now central to marine policy and practice in Europe. MSP was identified as a national priority in 2014 in South Africa, to help manage its extensive and internationally significant marine waters straddling the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with great ecological diversity and social and economic importance. 

 Following his leadership of **MSP projects** and his international reputation \(3.5, 3.6\), Jay was invited onto South Africa’s National Working Group tasked with producing the *National Framework for Marine Spatial Planning*, 09/2015\-03/2016. He was the sole academic in the group, working alongside representatives of government departments. Jay led on the practical section of the Framework, setting out the steps and timeline to be followed by the government department now responsible for MSP in South Africa. He encouraged the adaptation of MSP to the South African context, such as MSP being a tool for redressing historic racial injustices. 

 The Framework was approved by the Minister of Environmental Affairs in 05/2017 \(5.8.b\). It is cross\-referenced in South Africa’s *Marine Spatial Planning Act* 05/2018 \(5.8.c\). Jay’s involvement was coordinated by the German agency for international cooperation who provided logistical support to the process, and described him as having a “significant role” and “an important role in developing the procedural aspects of the Framework” \(5.8.a\). 

 The initial stages of the Framework are now being carried out \(5.8.d\). Firstly, a data portal has been developed that gathers, and makes publicly available, digital data on a wide range of marine characteristics and human activities, providing the evidence base for the marine plans \(5.9.a\). Secondly, four bioregional Marine Planning Areas have been designated. Work is now beginning on the first of these, the Eastern Cape region. Jay continues to support this process. A Director at the Dept of Environment, Forestry & Fisheries confirms that Jay is “currently facilitating international exchange… between government agencies responsible for marine spatial planning in the Global South” \(5.9.b\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the University of Southampton’s School of Mathematical Sciences into dynamic scheduling in the airport environment has been used to optimise operations in London Heathrow Airport’s baggage handling system, as part of the airport’s GBP16bn expansion programme. With its 80 million annual passengers \(pre\-COVID\-19\), inherent uncertainty in aircraft arrival and departure times, and costly, multi\-stakeholder implications of baggage delay, Heathrow’s baggage system posed a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. 

 Novel data\-driven optimisation tools, developed by Professor Chris Potts through collaborations with Heathrow and leading consultancy firm Arup, resulted in a new approach for scheduling the delivery of luggage to baggage carousels \(reclaims\) and a 20% reduction in the rate of short\-landed bags \(bags not transported with the passenger to the destination airport\).These significant improvements **increased convenience for passengers** and achieved **cumulative cost savings of GBP55m for the aviation industry**. This comprised **annual savings to the airline industry of GBP10m since October 2016** relating to short\-landed baggage costs and a **reduction in capital expenditure of over GBP20m for Heathrow Airport Limited** by improved scheduling and thereby eliminating the need to invest in additional baggage carousels. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Discrete optimisation has been a significant research area of the Operational Research \(OR\) group at the University of Southampton since the 1980s, with **scheduling** featuring prominently. An important sector where discrete optimisation is very useful is for planning airport operations.  Specifically, airports require scheduling and other discrete optimisation problems to be solved in order to create cost\-effective plans for baggage operations that provide passengers with an appropriate level of service. The OR group were therefore well placed to work with Arup and Heathrow Airport Limited on the optimisation of baggage operations. 

 Early research on scheduling mainly considered classical production scheduling problems having a single objective, with all problem data assumed to be deterministic and known in advance. However, **Professor Chris Potts** \(School of Mathematical Sciences\) introduced models, first published in 2001, that better capture some of the features that are present in practical scheduling applications. In one particular generalisation of classical scheduling, he extended the model beyond the production facility to include a larger part of the supply chain. For example, in \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] he proposed models and algorithms that combine decisions about production scheduling and the delivery of products to customers. In \[ **3.3**\] he explored methods for addressing the trade\-off between minimising waste when cutting materials to satisfy customer orders and reducing delays in the timely delivery of these orders to the customers. 

 More complex models require more sophisticated solution techniques. A widely\-used approach for tackling these challenging problems is to use metaheuristics, often known as local search methods. These techniques typically provide near\-optimal solutions while imposing limits on the computation time used. The key to the success of such methods is to navigate the solution space efficiently in the search for a high\-quality solution. 

 Creating enhancements to models often transforms a single\-objective problem into a problem with multiple objectives that are typically conflicting. Potts, in \[ **3.3**\], adapted a single\-objective metaheuristic solution approach to one that find solutions to problems with multiple objectives.  This was achieved by setting primary and secondary objectives and periodically alternating between them throughout the search procedure performed by the metaheuristic. 

 The GBP5.3m EPSRC\-funded LANCS Initiative \( **G1**, 2008\-14\) had a research aim of building theory for application to practical OR problems. LANCS had Transportation and Logistics as a research cluster, with Potts having the role of co\-leader. As a consequence of the collaborative opportunities offered through LANCS, the principles underpinning Potts’ production scheduling studies \[ **3.1**, **3.2**\] evolved into methodologies to improve the efficiency of transport and logistics systems. The problems addressed often have multiple objectives due to the different stakeholders. For example, maximising the convenience of passengers in a transport system often conflicts with minimising the operating costs of the transport provider. Furthermore, many problems are dynamic or on\-line, implying that information about the future arrives over time so that decisions have to be made with incomplete knowledge. 

 In a project funded by EUROCONTROL, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation \( **G2**, 2008\-11\), Potts led the design of various algorithms for more efficient scheduling of aircraft landings, without compromising safety. A key element of this problem is to increase runway utilisation by avoiding heavier aircraft landing immediately before lighter aircraft because safety constraints impose a longer separation time between landings in such cases due to the turbulence caused by wake vortices. This is an on\-line problem because the appearance of aircraft onto an air traffic controller’s radar screen is typically about 30 minutes before the landing time and landing times need to be fixed for aircraft arriving in the next 5\-10 minutes. Potts designed a rolling horizon algorithm \[ **3.4**\] in which the landing schedules are updated periodically to account for any new information about arriving aircraft. Multiple objectives included minimising: \(a\) the average and last landing time; \(b\) penalties for deviation from preferred landing times; and \(c\) extra fuel used for any delayed landing. This on\-line problem with multiple objectives has similar characteristics to those arising in the planning of baggage operations for arriving aircraft; the passenger experience in the baggage hall in terms of crowding, and waiting time needs balancing against the efficient deployment of baggage handlers. 

 This body of research in large\-scale combinatorial optimisation underpinned a partnership with Heathrow Airport Limited, beginning in 2012, to maximise the efficiency of the airport’s baggage processing operations. Much of the methodology was already in place to address the challenges. In particular, Potts’ research expertise in scheduling was used to design algorithms for determining the timing and routing of baggage to the airport arrivals hall, making use of available techniques in optimisation with multiple objectives \[ **3.3**\] and also in algorithms for on\-line problems \[ **3.4**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 London Heathrow Airport served over 80 million passengers annually at its pre\-COVID\-19 peak \[ **5.1**\] and handled an estimated 110 million pieces of baggage \[ **5.2**\]. Baggage operations are vital for the smooth running of an airport and the resource allocation and scheduling methods required to determine their efficient operation are not available in standard business process software. The operations represent a significant cost to airport operators and airlines. Airport charges that cover the cost of these processes have become a more significant part of the overall ticket price in recent years and consequently efficiency improvements are important for all of the three key stakeholder groups: passengers, airlines and airport operators. 

 The three key stakeholder groups for the airport each have their own objectives for the baggage system. While the airport operator is focused on cost, passengers and airlines tend to be more concerned about the level of service that they receive, e.g. the time spent waiting for bags to arrive or the level of overcrowding in the airport arrivals hall. This makes the optimisation problems multi\-objective. An airport also operates with a significant amount of uncertainty stemming from the stochastic nature of aircraft arrival and departure times. 

 Based on his research expertise in combinatorial optimisation, including work on runway scheduling, Potts began working with Heathrow Airport Limited on optimising its baggage operations in 2012 with the key outcomes of the collaboration occurring during the REF 2021 impact period \[ **5.3**\]. The baggage handling system at an airport the size of Heathrow is complex and requires careful planning to be robust against uncertainties in flight arrival and departure times. Potts’ work contributes in two ways. First, it ensures that advance planning is in place. Second, it allows the daily planning of operations to be adapted to flight delays and uncertainty about the arrival order of aircraft, which is dictated on the day by air traffic control. Accounting for uncertainty requires a data\-driven approach in which operational plans are updated in real time using online optimisation algorithms that can find effective new solutions quickly. A specific example of this is the allocation of arriving flights to baggage carousels. Potts designed an algorithm for allocating baggage reclaims which incorporates multiple objectives, thereby helping to ensure that passenger waiting times for baggage are kept as low as possible, passenger crowding in the baggage hall is not excessive, and baggage handlers’ time is used effectively. 

 According to the Director of Operational Planning at Heathrow Airport, “ *The work stopped us from changing the operational approach to a fixed allocation plan \(which was preferred by some of the handling teams\) as it demonstrated this would have led to a deterioration in performance, and a worsening of passenger experience at Heathrow. The project showed us that allocation needed to be kept dynamic or we would need additional capacity to avoid congestion*” \[ **5.3**\] **.** He continued: “ *… the work carried out with the University of Southampton has allowed us to take a more scientific approach to managing the complex baggage handling system at Heathrow that is able to react quickly to disruptions in flight arrivals. This has been invaluable in improving our operational efficiency*.” The benefits in terms of increased operational efficiency in an airport the size of Heathrow are substantial. The Director of Operational Planning concluded: “ *As an indication of the value of this, increasing capacity efficiency to the extent of avoiding the requirement to add one additional reclaim has been estimated **to save over £20mill in Capex* \[GBP20,000,000 in capital expenditure\].” 

 In 2016, Arup was part of a consortium awarded a GBP16bn contract to manage the expansion of Heathrow where a key component of the expansion plans involved a transformation of the baggage handling systems. Arup is an independent firm of designers, planners, engineers, architects, consultants and technical specialists, with annual revenues of GBP1.7bn. Due to his earlier work with Heathrow Airport Limited, Potts was approached by Arup to assist with some aspects of the transformation project, drawing on his expertise in multi\-objective combinatorial optimisation \[ **3.3**\] and on\-line scheduling \[ **3.4**\].  Specifically, he developed a data\-driven performance tool that produced a better characterisation of the reasons for baggage being short\-landed \(bags not transported with the passenger to the destination airport\). Not unexpectedly, results showed that delays to aircraft landings have adverse effects on baggage movement and thereby incur subsequent costs \[ **5.4**\]. They also suggested a set of key performance indicators that distil the multiple data sources into just a handful of statistics that provide the best way of monitoring the behaviour of the baggage handling system \[ **5.4**\]. Summing up the significance of the challenge that the development tool was designed to address, Arup’s Airport Development Team Leader wrote: “ *The cost of failure can be high. Within the industry, the overall costs incurred as a result of a bag not being delivered for the passenger to collect are estimated to be around £100 per bag … At Heathrow alone, we estimate that the cost arising from short\-landed bags, before the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008, used to be around £60 million annually* \[ **5.4**\].” 

 The resulting tool, based on the University of Southampton research, has significantly reduced the number of short\-landed bags, which has translated into substantial cost savings for the airline industry. Arup confirms: “ *Heathrow’s short\-landed rate has, since this particular piece of work was completed in October 2016, improved by around 20% \- **saving airlines an estimated £10 million annually**,*” \[ **5.4**\] amounting to a **cumulative saving of approximately GBP35,000,000** up to the start of the COVID\-19 pandemic. 

 Describing its collaboration with Southampton as “ *extremely fruitful”*, Arup stated that the research results were of direct relevance to their own business and that of their clients \[ **5.4**\]. Its Airport Development Team Leader said: “ *It has proved the concept and value of integrating large, disparate data sets to produce information upon which action can be taken. At Arup we are actively pursuing ways in which this approach to baggage data can be productionised and used as a commercial service offering to other airports* \[ **5.4**\].” This is further evidenced by Arup’s use of their baggage handling project with Heathrow as a case study for its business development aims \[ **5.5**\]; Arup is using the knowledge transfer from Southampton as a significant component of their consultancy offering for other airports in order to access a market that, it says, could represent several millions of pounds per year \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Potts’ work also feeds into Heathrow’s growth plans for developing Terminal 5, which are currently on hold owing to the COVID\-19 pandemic. Heathrow’s Director of Operational Planning said: “ *We were also in the process of implementing the full findings of this work on a wider scale by including it in growth plans for Terminal 5, the largest terminal, when the pandemic began … and we are already looking at similar approaches to tackle the new issues created by the impacts of COVID\-19 and hygiene measures such as social distancing.*” \[ **5.4**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Vladimir Getov’s pioneering research on message passing for Java \(MPJ\) provided a crucially important framework and programming environment for parallel and distributed computing with Java. This invention resulted in an industry standard specification and a novel MPJ\-based hierarchical development methodology for a new generation of large\-scale grid and cloud\-based distributed systems. These achievements led to: 

-  *Impact on Professional Practice*: Getov’s MPJ specification provided the foundations for the Java binding in Open MPI \(message passing interface\) – the most popular worldwide open\-source library, which provides easy access to this binding for application programmers. 

-  *Economic Impacts*: IBM’s biometric identification system, built in collaboration with Getov and using the MPJ framework, has had significant economic impact for IBM via the quicker return of investment achieved by its higher productivity and shorter development cycle. The adoption of Getov’s MPJ development methodology by ActiveEon has also seen the company demonstrate significant revenue growth \(18M USD across the REF period\). 

-  *Social Impacts*: IBM Watson’s development was based on Getov’s component composition message passing approach and has demonstrable benefits in the areas of social services, environmental protection, and public safety. ActiveEon’s use of Getov’s MPJ development methodology in their ProActive workflow and scheduling framework has had significant benefits in biomedical distributed applications.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Released in 1995, the Java programming language was rapidly adopted by industry and end users because of its portability and internet programming support. However, Java did not have the symmetric message passing capability, widely recognised as vitally important for parallel and distributed memory computing. By contrast, efficient message passing support had already been captured in the MPI standard for other programming languages such as C, C\+\+, and Fortran. 

 Professor Vladimir Getov identified this weakness and conducted pioneering research and development on MPJ which has been a main area of focus for the Distributed and Intelligent Systems Research Group \(DIS RG\) at the University of Westminster since the late 90s. This research team comprises: Professor V. Getov, Dr A. Bolotov, Dr S. Isaiadis, Dr S. Minchev, Dr T. Weigold, Dr A. Basukoski, Dr J. Thiyagalingam, and Dr A. Basso. The early success of DIS RG attracted high international interest and the creation of the International MPJ Working Group with participation from the UK, USA, Europe, and Japan. 

 Chaired by Vladimir Getov, the MPJ Working Group developed a methodology for building mixed\-language MPJ applications which evolved from three approaches: \(a\) wrapping of existing MPI libraries via hand\-written software; \(b\) automatic code generation of the wrapper interface by a novel tool\-generator; and \(c\) development from scratch of the MPI libraries in Java. Getov has participated in the development of all three approaches by implementing the MPJ specification and ensuring full compatibility with the already existing and very successful MPI standard. The **MPJ results successfully resembled MPI, providing symmetric message passing for distributed computing with Java** leading to its adoption by the professional community \[1\]. 

 This working group was then invited to join the Global Grid Forum \(an international professional organisation focusing on grid and cloud computing\) where Getov furthered this research by expanding the application of MPJ into modern large\-scale distributed systems such as grids and clouds, both of which allow for the analysis of huge data sets. Tackling the scalability and productivity challenges, Getov and colleagues formally specified building blocks called “components” and **introduced component\-based approaches that enabled MPJ to provide the interconnection mechanisms in complex grid and cloud systems** \[2\]. 

 Continuing work in this area, the next main research challenge was to replace the Common Component Architecture \(CCA\) model. Available in early 2000, the CCA provided only limited support for a single coupling of components in a 2\-dimensional space. Getov’s innovation was to develop a novel abstract approach for hierarchical \(multiple\) composition of components in a 3\-dimensional space. Further, Getov invented a novel MPJ\-based hierarchical components composition development methodology for a new generation of large\-scale grid and cloud\-based distributed systems. This provided the theoretical background for a recursive and efficient component\-based development methodology. The combination of these research contributions to the European  [CoreGRID](http://coregrid.ercim.eu/mambo/) project significantly advanced this new field through Getov’s **development of the hierarchical Grid Component Model \(GCM\) specification for various distributed computing systems** \[3\]. Together with his DIS RG team, Getov followed up the GCM specification with proof\-of\-concept experiments in a development environment that used the hierarchical components MPJ methodology and provided confidence about the higher efficiency of this novel approach \[4\]. 

 Building on this work, the DIS RG team, led by Getov, was a main partner in the European  [GridComp](http://gridcomp.ercim.eu/) project. Working in close collaboration with other partners including INRIA Sophia Antipolis \(France\), IBM\-Research \(Switzerland\), Atos Origin \(Spain\), University of Pisa \(Italy\), and Tsinghua University \(China\), the GridComp project designed and built a fully functional platform incorporating the ICBE \(Integrated Component\-Based Environment\) prototype for hierarchical components composition \[5\]. A major contribution of GridComp was **the design and implementation of a component based MPJ framework for rapid development and deployment of efficient grid and cloud computing applications**. This work led to **four new international standards**, approved by ETSI \(European Telecommunications Standards Institute\): ""GCM Interoperability Deployment"", Aug 2008; ""GCM Interoperability Application Description"", Aug 2008; “GCM Fractal ADL”, Mar 2009; “GCM Management API \(Java, C, WSDL\)”, Mar 2010. 

 Further results on smart cloud architectures followed the expanded ICBE methodology, which included **three approaches for developing GCM applications** \[6\]. Getov contributed significantly to each: The first, a wrapper approach for legacy codes reuse, supports both hand\-written and automatically generated code. The second approach componentises existing applications via appropriate modifications. The third approach is component\-based development from scratch. This work confirmed **the significantly higher productivity of the component\-based MPJ development methodology**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

#  Impact 1: Professional Practice \- Open Source and Standardisation 

 Since August 2014, the MPJ specification has been included in the core distribution of the widely used Open MPI \(Open\-Source Message Passing Interface\) software environment. Developed and maintained by a consortium of research, academic, and industry partners, Open MPI is a suite of open\-source software libraries implementing the MPI standard for High Performance Computing \(HPC\) \[a\-i\]. The Java binding developed in Open MPI is based on the ground\-breaking results of the International MPJ Working Group chaired by Vladimir Getov \(output \[1\]\) and incorporate the four ETSI standards that resulted from the GridComp project \(outputs \[4\], \[5\] and \[6\]\). The Open MPI team have highlighted that these **‘standardized classes’ of Java are of benefit to an open\-source library** as they ‘provide a platform\-independent way to access host\-specific features such as threads, graphics, file management, and networking’ \[a\-ii, p.4 & 2\]. In other words, these standardised classes guarantee full compatibility and portability across a wide variety of platforms and applications. 

 In recent years, Open MPI has become the most popular MPI library, as is evidenced by the MPI International Survey, which received over 800 user responses from 42 different countries between Feb & July 2019 \[a\-iii, p.1\]. Of the MPI users identified, 85.8% \(718 respondents\) use Open MPI \[a\-iv\]. As such, **through its inclusion in this open\-source library, MPJ has been reaching a wide range of users**, 80% of which belong to non\-profit organisations, including government institutes, as well as software and hardware vendors, with the use of Java being especially popular in the UK and Russia \[a\-i, p.13 & 16\]. 

 Regarding the significance of this wide range of users, the Open MPI team explain that MPJ was added as it is one of the three key parallel computing technologies upon which HPC depends and has several benefits. For instance, it ‘provides efficient built\-in support for threads’ which increases the software development productivity. In addition, ‘some numerical libraries are based on multithreading’ and MPI itself ‘can benefit from Java because its widespread use makes it likely to find new uses beyond traditional HPC applications’ \[a\-ii, p.1\-2\]. As such **the primary impact on professional practice relates to providing easy access to Java binding for programmers** who can exploit these benefits \(output \[2\]\). Secondary impacts arise through specific examples of such usage of MPJ via Open MPI. For instance, the PPF library for parallel particle filtering applications allows application programmers to write quickly and easily shared\- and distributed\-memory PPF codes in Java \[a\-v\], producing the benefit of ‘ **reducing the cost of traditional particle filters** by approximating the likelihood with a mixture of uniform distributions over pre\-defined cells or bins.’ 

#  Impact 2. Economic Impact 

 An example of the significant economic impact on users of Prof Getov’s innovative component based MPJ development methodology is its contribution to ‘the long\-term research and development collaboration for IBM’s Cloud Computing agenda and strategy’, through knowledge exchange activities at IBM Research Centers in Zurich, Almaden, Watson, and Dublin, as well as direct collaborative research \[b\]. Dr Peter Buhler, Head of Computer Science at the Zurich Laboratory states that this has resulted in their ‘using and developing further the adopted component\-based methodology and development platform which has \[in turn\] influenced the professional practice in building complex applications for grid and cloud systems’ at IBM \[b\]. 

 For instance, Buhler \[b\] confirms that **IBM Watson** was ‘designed by reusing the principles developed and standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute as part of Vladimir Getov’s work’ \(output \[5\]\). This supercomputer is a unique artificial intelligence system capable of answering questions posed in natural language and its economic significance to IBM is indicated by its global market share of 16.1% placing it amongst the three dominant systems in the Machine Learning category \[d\-i\]. IBM Watson has been used by nearly 2,800 companies as of July 2020 due to its usefulness across a variety of application domains. Statistics by revenue show that 39% of Watson users are large companies \(>$1000M\), 37% are small \(<$50M\), and 16% are medium\-sized, and that they cut across different sectors of industry – the largest being Computer Software \(22%\), Hospital & Health Care \(14%\), Higher Education \(8%\), and Information Technology and Services \(7%\) \[d\-i\]. 

 Buhler also cites **‘the Biometric Identification System application** developed in collaboration with Vladimir’s DIS RG team and delivered by IBM Research – Zurich Laboratory’ \(Fig. 1\), as having a ‘significant economic impact’ through its producing ‘quicker return on investment \[…\] achieved because of the much higher productivity and shorter development cycle provided by the invented component\-based methodology and development process’ \[b\]. This biometric identification system contributes to the Global Technology Services segment of IBM’s business, which in 2019 comprised the largest share of IBM's total revenue at nearly 36% \($27.4 billion\) \[c\-ii\]. The use of Getov’s component based MPJ framework provided ‘pre\-built template components’ from which a system can be built that ‘guarantee\[d\] real\-time biometric identification functionality over a very large, constantly growing database of enrolled identities \(fingerprints\)’ \[b\]. Furthermore, Getov’s ICBE \(outputs \[4\], \[5\] and \[6\]\) ‘has been instrumental in continuously monitoring and maintaining the system’ \[b\], which has been a significant aspect of IBM’s commercial offering to corporations and governments \[c\-i\]. 




 Fig. 1: Security Biometric Identification System \[c\-iii\] 


 Another company that has economically benefitted from Getov’s innovative component\-based MPJ methodology, as well as the underpinning ETSI standards, is  [ActiveEon](https://www.activeeon.com/about/company/) – a France\-based software company that provides innovative open\-source solutions for IT automation, acceleration and scalability, big data, distributed computing and application orchestration. During the GridCOMP project \(06/2006 – 02/2009\), Getov and colleagues had initially demonstrated the usefulness of the component based MPJ development methodology to industry by using it to wrap and Grid\-enable aerodynamic wing modelling software at ActiveEon, and to prove the integration of data staging for the input and output files into this sweeping / optimisation process for any given configuration. 

 As Prof Denis Caromel, CEO of ActiveEon, states, since then the company ‘has been directly exploiting the results of the project, including the GCM and MPJ framework \(output \[3\]\), particularly in its *ProActive workflows and scheduling open\-source* middleware which has been used for delivering solutions for a range of commercial customers’ \[e\-i\]. Caromel further specifies the economic impact of this adoption of Getov’s innovations: ‘over the years since August 2013, **ActiveEon has achieved revenue growth of 18M USD starting with less than 1M USD in 2013 and reaching revenue of 19M USD in 2020**. Our number of employees has been increasing significantly over the same period from 30 employees at the end of 2013 to 106 employees in 2020. Those successful results would not have been possible without Professor Getov’s direct contribution to the component based MPJ development methodology and ETSI standards adopted and used by ActiveEon throughout the 13 years of its existence. His work has reduced substantially the return of investment cycle of complex distributed applications’ \[e\-i\]. 

#  Impact 3. Social Impact 

 Beyond the significant economic impact Vladimir Getov has made with his contributions, Buhler explains that ‘\[t\]he technical advancements he \[Getov\] has invented and co\-invented are the basis for many Web\-scale applications we have at our fingertips today’, creating a ‘resulting impact on the society’ \[b\]. IBM specify three key social impacts of their cognitive technology in lengthy case studies featuring real\-world usage of the IBM Watson supercomputer that would not exist without Getov’s research \[d\-ii to d\-iv\]. The areas of interventions listed below provide typical examples: 

-  **Transforming social services** by providing ‘easier\-to\-access, more personalized services \[that\] can help individuals at risk better manage their own well\-being, getting the right support when they need it’ \[d\-ii\]. A specific use case is ‘Aspiranet, which currently serves 22,000 youth and families across California, \[and\] is using natural language inquiry of unstructured data to help youth transition from foster home care to living on their own’; their CEO confirms ‘cognitive technology helps free up caseworkers’ time, enabling them to focus on what matters most, human connection’ \[d\-ii\]. This is a significant impact given that in the ‘United States, social worker turnover is as high as 90 percent per year, with heavy workloads, including paperwork, as a major contributing factor’ \[d\-ii\]. 

-  **Providing environmental protections:** IBM gives the example of their work with the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau to reduce air pollution in China \(the cause of more than one million premature deaths per year\) via the 2014 Green Horizons initiative, which ‘addresses these challenges by using advanced machine learning to identify smaller sections of the city that are at risk. Along with trade\-off analyses, this enables more targeted mitigation actions, such as shutting down targeted industries, while minimizing socioeconomic disruptions’ \[d\-iii\]. 

-  **Enhancing public safety**: IBM gives the example of how they used Watson to anticipate and respond to the Oct 2015 Hurricane Patricia \(one of the strongest storms ever recorded\): ‘weather prediction models based on artificial intelligence \(AI\) provided advanced warning to an IBM production center in Guadalajara. The system had analyzed huge volumes of disparate information, including weather data, social feeds and news reports to get a comprehensive view of the storm's trajectory. \[…\] Early warning gave site officials the crucial time they needed to act’ and they ‘opted to evacuate the site as a precautionary measure’ \[d\-iv\]. 

 Another example of social impacts that have been created through the adoption of Getov’s innovations is found in the work of ActiveEon.  As mentioned earlier, ActiveEon has used Getov’s component based MPJ development methodology in their *ProActive Workflows & Scheduling* software which incorporates dynamic and autonomous workload allocation to an elastic pool of resources using multi\-language software components within the HPC cloud\-based workflows \[e\-i\] \[e\-ii, p.30\]. Among a range of case studies demonstrating usage of this software across sectors including mining, satellite technology, visa processing, and solvency solutions \[e\-iii\], is its use for microbiome analytics orchestration \[e\-iv, p.18\-20\]. The enabling of microbiome analytics orchestration at this scale is of **significant benefit to the biomedical field as microbiome innovation encompasses pharmaceutical applications** such as personalised medicine and nutrition, identification of the impact of drugs on the gut microbiome, and identification of bacterial biomarkers associated with dysbiosis \(microbial imbalance\) \[e\-iv, p.8\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Although therapeutic engagement is perceived as the crux of mental health nursing, prior to the Therapeutic Engagement Questionnaire \(TEQ\) there was no metric to measure this objectively in acute inpatient mental health settings. The TEQ was developed and validated in England as a tool that can quantify and give recognition to registered mental health nursing therapeutic engagement activity with service users within a therapeutic environment. It has been adopted and implemented by the National Health Service \(NHS\), Mental Health Trusts and independent mental health hospitals in England.  The TEQ has also been successfully implemented internationally, in Slovenia, Finland, and Malta. Implementation has led to TEQ data being utilised by nursing staff at all levels of seniority to assess and improve registered mental health nurse therapeutic engagement activity. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the inception of Peplau’s \[1952\] seminal work emphasising the primacy of the nurse\-patient relationship, therapeutic engagement has been considered the crux of mental health / psychiatric nursing \[McAndrew et al., 2014\]. Given the perceived importance of therapeutic engagement in mental health nursing, it is important to measure quantitatively registered mental health nurse\-service user therapeutic interactions, from both nurse and service user perspectives, in the acute inpatient mental health setting. Prior to the Therapeutic Engagement Questionnaire \(TEQ\), there was no such quantitative tool available. Consequently, unwarranted variation in mental health nursing practice could arise, as it was not possible to apply objective measures. Therefore, Chambers’ team sought to address the overall research question: can a short, simple tool be developed for routine use within acute inpatient settings to quantify and give recognition to registered mental health nursing therapeutic engagement activity? 

 Professor Chambers led a team of national and international academic researchers \(Dr Kantaris; Professor McAndrew, University of Salford; Professor Nolan, University College London; Professor Kuosmanen, University of Eastern Finland; Associate Professor Al Hadid, University of Jordan; Dr Sammut, University of Malta; Associate Professor Štiglic, University of Maribor; Associate Professor Al\-Sagarat, Mutah University, Jordan\), service users, and registered mental health nurses, to co\-design and validate the TEQ. 

 Six underpinning research studies **\[R1 \- R6\]** of service users and registered mental health nurses were undertaken in acute inpatient settings. From the perspective of service users, dignity, respect, and being listened to were highlighted as important values in therapeutic engagement **\[R1\]**. Registered mental health nurses appreciated a positive therapeutic environment, and valued time to relate to and engage with service users. Nonetheless, they could experience fear and vulnerability in response to high levels of service user distress and disturbance **\[R2, R3\]**. Some attitudinal differences to service users and to therapeutic engagement were reported among mental health nurses across European countries; related to social, cultural, and nursing practice context **\[R4\]**. 

 The TEQ is the first intervention in acute inpatient settings to be collaboratively co\-produced with both service users and registered mental health nurses, resulting in the TEQ being the first tool with the capacity to assess therapeutic engagement activities from the perspective of both groups. An initial questionnaire in two versions \(service user and registered mental health nurse\) was developed in 2012\-2015 based on existing literature **\[R1 \- R4\]**, feedback from a workshop with 70 service users, clinical nurses and nurse academics, and the results from in\-depth interviews with 19 detained service users **\[R5\]**. An expert panel of clinical and academic mental health nursing members and service users also reviewed the questionnaires **\[R5\]**. Further research \(2015\-2016\) refined and validated the TEQ through principal components analysis and comparison with two other validated questionnaires that measure therapeutic alliance. The research involved 714 service users and 611 registered mental health nurses across 26 NHS Mental Health Trusts in England. Findings showed that the TEQ is psychometrically sound and acceptably valid as a measure of registered mental health nurse\-service user therapeutic engagement in acute inpatient settings **\[R5, R6\]**. Subsequently, the TEQ has been translated into Arabic, Dutch, Finnish, Maltese, and Slovenian. It has been validated in Malta \(2018\-2019\), and the psychometric properties evaluated and shown to be sound in Jordan \(2017\) and in Finland \(2019\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Therapeutic Engagement Questionnaire \(TEQ\) has been implemented nationally and internationally in acute inpatient mental health settings as a reliable and valid therapeutic engagement measurement tool. It is used to assess and improve registered mental health nurse \- service user therapeutic engagement activity. The information gathered by the TEQ has helped to inform nursing staff at all levels of seniority, including Directors of Nursing and ward managers, about the nature of registered mental health nursing therapeutic engagement activity and how it is experienced by service users. The tool has demonstrated its value in highlighting the role of registered mental health nurses in therapeutic engagement activity, and in identifying practice variation and support and training needs. This has resulted in national policy impact and impact on nursing practice in the UK and internationally. 

 **National policy impact** 

 NHS England promotes the TEQ in its Atlas of Shared Learning **\[S1\]**, emphasising the importance of the TEQ in supporting delivery of the NHS Long Term Plan. The Atlas is based on selected case studies providing evidence of how nursing staff have identified and addressed variation in practice leading to improved patient outcomes. It provides a key evidence base of new practice to help drive delivery of NHS healthcare priorities over the next ten years, as set out in the NHS Long Term Plan. The NHS England and NHS Improvement Clinical Lead for Mental Health supported a letter being sent from Professor Chambers through the National Mental Health Nurse Directors Forum to all members, on the value and benefits of implementing the TEQ. This prompted take\-up of the TEQ by three additional NHS Mental Health Trusts. The Clinical Lead also invited Professor Chambers to present the impacts from implementation of the TEQ at an NHS England & NHS Improvement Mental Health webinar in March 2021. 

 **Impact on practice in NHS Mental Health Trusts and private mental health hospitals** 

 In England, four of the NHS Mental Health Trusts have fully implemented the TEQ and a further three are in the process of implementing the tool. This is 13% of the 54 NHS Mental Health Trusts in England. The independent provider, The Priory Group, has also implemented the TEQ in three of their adult acute mental health units. Feedback from registered mental health nurses, nurse managers and Directors of Nursing has been positive about the value of the TEQ. In several Trusts, robust and transparent monitoring though use of the TEQ has highlighted barriers and obstacles to registered mental health nurses delivering perceived appropriate and valued therapeutic activities. As a result of being made aware of these problems, managers and nurses have been able to institute supportive and remedial actions **\[S2\-7\]**. 

 The TEQ has been implemented as part of the SW London and St George’s NHS Mental Health Trust Quality Improvement and Innovation \(QII\) initiative, outlined in their 2018\-2023 strategy. Using the TEQ, the Trust’s QII Project Manager found that registered mental health nurses gave higher scores than service users for the contribution of nursing staff to the recovery of service users in the general ward setting \(8.20 v. 7.07, with ‘10’ the most helpful they could be\) and in one\-to\-one clinical sessions \(8.34 v. 7.14\). There was wide variation in the scores given by service users, suggesting differential experiences and variation in nursing practice. The TEQ results also highlighted specific improvement areas from the service user perspective: support in making choices and planned care risks, working in partnership, and coordinated and collaborative care planning. In response, the Project Manager has worked with ward managers to identify appropriate quality improvement interventions to be piloted and assessed using the TEQ **\[S2\]**. These include named nurse sessions being protected times and scheduled within shifts. Additionally, cultural changes are being introduced at ward level. One ward manager, for example, now references the TEQ in clinical supervisions with nursing staff to identify and illuminate therapeutic engagement support they should be delivering; one of several impacts of the TEQ presented by the ward manager at the National Mental Health Nurse Directors’ Forum Conference, 2020 **\[S3\]**. Additionally, the Trusts’ Director of Nursing and Quality reported that the TEQ was ‘ *continuing to have a positive impact on the care we provide’* and *‘continuing to be influential as the results have already been used to influence and inform wider pieces of work in the organisation’* **\[S4\]**. 

 Several Trusts identified, through use of the TEQ, that service users are less involved in planning their care than rated by registered mental health nurses. This has resulted in Trusts initiating nursing practice improvements to help increase service user engagement. In Cumbria, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear \(CNTW\) NHS Foundation Trust, identification of a significant difference in how service users and registered mental health nurses score service user collaboration in care planning in one\-to\-one clinical sessions \(64.3% nurses strongly agreeing with care\-planning TEQ statements v. 41.2% service users\) has supported changes for improvement. Nursing managers have re\-established nurse\-service user engagement as a priority and the Group Nurse Director led reflective sessions with nursing staff on increasing meaningful service user collaboration in care planning. The Executive Director of Nursing and Chief Operating Officer described the TEQ as ‘ *an enabler, motivating the nursing workforce to helpfully challenge practice and engage meaningfully with the multi\-disciplinary teams*’ and stated that the TEQ findings have ‘ *influenced the implementation of the new Central Inpatient Nursing Staffing Model, with increased numbers of senior and experienced mental health nursing staff on each ward supporting quality of care delivery, enhancing nursing as a defined profession and promoting the importance and value of therapeutic engagement’* **\[S5\]** *.* The CNTW Trust are discussing with teams ‘ *to extend the use of TEQ …\[to\]… other nurse and service user contact points such as therapeutic and protected medication administration*’ **\[S5\]**. 

 The TEQ was implemented in all mental health adult inpatient wards of the NE London NHS Foundation Trust. Findings highlighted that service users in the older adult ward rated the quality of therapeutic engagement received higher than service users on the general wards, where there has been significantly faster turnover and discharge during the Covid\-19 pandemic. Identification of this issue has led the Trust Director of Nursing and the team leading implementation of the TEQ to explore with ward managers how good practice on collaborative therapeutic working can be shared and trialled across wards. The Director of Nursing also reported that the Trust have linked learning from the TEQ ‘ *into the development of all our wards to achieve AIMS \(Accreditation for Inpatient Mental Health Services\) and it has enabled us to hear the user and staff voice in relation to our service developments’* **\[S6\]**. 

 Having identified through implementation of the TEQ that service users on one unit did not know their named/primary nurse, the Priory Group were persuaded to introduce a new practice model that involves the named/primary nurse introducing themselves to the service user at each twice\-daily nurse handover. The nurse also asks the service user open\-ended questions about their care. The Priory Group’s Specialist Director further reports an ‘ *increase in numbers of nurses requesting to attend therapeutic engagement\-based CPD courses’*, reflective of their increased awareness of the value of therapeutic engagement. Additionally, the Director stated that they *‘plan to include some information about the \(TEQ\) implementation project in the next set of Priory Quality Accounts 2020\-2021*’ and that another of the Priory’s adult acute service units is considering implementation having been ‘ *very impressed with the TEQ’* **\[S7\]**. 

 **International impact** 

 The TEQ has been implemented in Slovenia \(2018\), Finland \(2019\), and Malta \(2020\). Jordan will implement the TEQ in 2021. 

 In Slovenia, implementation of the TEQ in two acute inpatient mental health institutions *'was key in identifying the variation in practice across the institutions, something which had not been achieved before.'* The TEQ found significant differences between the two institutions in the average scores given by both service users and registered mental health nurses for the quality of general ward therapeutic engagement actions, and one\-to\-one therapeutic engagement interactions. The TEQ results also identified two key problematic issues \- nurses giving service users *'control over their care plan'* and *'encouraging service users to step out of their comfort zone*.' As a result of these findings, ' *clinical nursing staff will review their current nursing practice. Accordingly, they will update their guidelines on engaging with patients  and how to directly involve patients in planning their care.update their guidelines on engaging with patients, in particular how to directly involve patients in planning their care'* **\[S8\]**. 

 In Finland, pre\-testing of the TEQ across 10 acute psychiatric inpatient units of two hospitals generated positive feedback on the benefits of the tool from both service users and registered nurses. Following this feedback the TEQ has been implemented across 20 units in two Helsinki hospitals. The pre\-testing phase found some variation between units in the scores given by service users for therapeutic engagement practice, on the unit in general and in one\-to\-one interactions. Mangers and nurses reported that this was useful learning since units with poorer results could put in place quality improvements to address variation in nursing therapeutic engagement practice Service users reported feeling that as a result of the tool making nursing activity more transparent, the quality of their care would improve **\[S9\]**. The Nursing Director at Helsinki University Hospital upheld the TEQ as a tool *'for quality improvement because it helps deliver standardized quality therapeutic care for service users, by driving out any identified poor nursing practice'* **\[S10\]**. 

 Implementation of the TEQ on the main admissions ward in Malta's mental health hospital showed that service users gave slightly lower overall scores than psychiatric nurses for statements in relation to the therapeutic environment and atmosphere of the ward \(62.1 v. 67.7\), and to one\-to\-one clinical interactions \(65.9 v.67.7\). The TEQ also highlighted particular problems relating to the inclusion and dignity afforded to service users by psychiatric nurses. Discussing the findings in a focus group, the ward manager and psychiatric nurses reported that the TEQ had provided insight into aspects of therapeutic care they may have *'taken for granted'*. Additionally, by highlighting *'problems that were not obvious to them*' the TEQ will enable them to target specific areas for further training and improvement. As a result of these findings the Director of Nursing at Malta's Mount Carmel Hospital considers the TEQ *'to be of value to our organisation and it can be included as part of our regular audits in the clinical area'* **\[S11\]**. 

 In addition to the specific impacts described above, the wider value and significance of the TEQ \(and its underpinning research\) to mental health nursing, is recognised by Professor Mary Chambers being awarded the  [Eileen Skellern Memorial Lecture in 2017](http://www.skellern.info/2017.html). This prestigious annual award celebrates significant advances in the field of mental health and mental health nursing.

 **1. Summary of Impact** 

 Between August 2013 and December 2020, African governments developed conservation action plans for cheetahs and African wild dogs covering 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup>, appointed 14 national coordinators to oversee the plans’ implementation, and enabled new, on\-the\-ground cheetah and wild dog conservation across 645,000km<sup>2</sup>. This impact builds upon research by Institute of Zoology \(IoZ\) Professors Sarah Durant and Rosie Woodroffe conducted between 2000 and 2020, showing that cheetahs and African wild dogs require conservation at vast spatial scales, achievable only through sustainable co\-existence with people and domestic animals. The same research also underpins a new international policy framework jointly established by the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

  

 The cheetah \( *Acinonyx jubatus*\) and the African wild dog \( *Lycaon pictus*\) are two of the world’s most highly threatened species, both persisting in a small fraction of their former geographic ranges. IoZ Professor Sarah Durant directs the world’s longest\-running study of cheetah ecology and behaviour, in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, while IoZ Professor Rosie Woodroffe established the first study of African wild dogs living outside protected areas, in the rangelands of northern Kenya. By tracking the fates of hundreds of individual cheetahs and wild dogs across multiple generations, these two long\-term studies \(cheetah: between 1974 and 2021, wild dog: between 2001 and 2021\) have yielded ecological insights which have revolutionised conservation efforts for these and other large carnivore species. 

 Cheetahs and wild dogs share two unusual traits: relative to other carnivores of similar size, both species live at very low population densities, and range across very large areas. An innovative behavioural study, published by Durant in 2000, highlights the mechanism underlying these traits: cheetahs risk losing their kills, and their lives, to lions and hyaenas so they move into areas where prey are less abundant and predation risks are therefore lower \[R1\]. The consequently low population densities and wide\-ranging behaviour of these two species mean that cheetahs and wild dogs require conservation on geographic scales seldom considered in terrestrial ecosystems. 

 Studies of population dynamics highlight additional challenges to conserving these two species. In 2000, Durant and her team showed that cheetahs naturally experience high cub mortality, with even small increases predicted to extirpate populations \[R2\]. This pattern means that removing cubs from wild populations, which occurs through the illegal pet trade, poses a serious extinction risk for cheetahs. This high cub mortality also means that adults which are killed \(e.g. by farmers\) may not be replaced, likewise risking extinction \[R2\]. 

 Wild dogs’ sociable nature generates population dynamics that are very different from those of cheetahs, but equally problematic. In 2019, Woodroffe showed that members of larger packs survive better, and produce larger litters, but the loss of a single dominant animal can cause the whole pack to collapse \[R3\]. This pattern generates boom\-and\-bust dynamics which can trigger local extinctions with little prior warning \[R3\]. Woodroffe’s earlier \(2012\) work shows that such impacts are especially likely where diseases such as rabies, caught from domestic dogs \[R4\], can kill whole packs and devastate wild dog populations. 

 Despite these threats, Woodroffe and Durant have shown that cheetahs and wild dogs can persist in some human\-dominated landscapes, where lower densities of competing predators may counteract anthropogenic threats \[R2\]. In 2019, Woodroffe showed that wild dogs living among traditional pastoralists and on private cattle ranches survived just as well as those in protected areas \[R3\], while in 2017 Durant showed that 77% of remaining cheetah range falls on such non\-protected lands \[R5\]. 

 Durant’s 2017 modelling shows how the two species’ tendency to range indiscriminately across protected and unprotected lands means that human pressures on unprotected lands can potentially extirpate them both inside and outside reserves \[R5\]. Both authors have therefore sought sustainable ways to protect these species while also benefiting local people, for example through Woodroffe’s 2007 studies on traditional husbandry to reduce predation on livestock \[R6\], and her 2012 prediction that domestic dog vaccination should prevent rabies in both people and wild dogs \[R4\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The research finding that cheetahs and wild dogs require conservation across geographic scales seldom considered in terrestrial ecosystems inspired Durant and Woodroffe to address this challenge by establishing, in 2006, the Range Wide Conservation Programme for Cheetahs and African Wild Dogs \(RWCP\). This programme works with national governments, non\-governmental organisations, and other partners to support and encourage conservation of the two species on the vast geographical scales needed, across protected and unprotected lands, within and across national borders \[S1, S2\]. Informed by Durant and Woodroffe’s research, between 2013 and 2020 the RWCP: 

-  Developed national conservation action plans for cheetahs and wild dogs in partnership with seven range state governments \(Algeria, Angola, Benin, Chad, Namibia, Niger, and Tanzania\) and local non\-governmental organisations, together covering 1.6 million km<sup>2</sup> of known cheetah range and over 500,000 km<sup>2</sup> of known wild dog range \[S1\], \[S2\], \[S3\], \[S4\]. In developing and implementing these plans, national wildlife authorities have learned to address the unique conservation challenges posed by these very wide\-ranging predator species \[S1\], \[S3\], \[S4\]. 

-  Reviewed and updated the International Union for Conservation of Nature/Species Survival Commission’s IUCN/SSC regional strategic plan for the conservation of cheetahs and African wild dogs in southern Africa, and reviewed and updated three national conservation action plans for cheetahs and wild dogs in partnership with three range state governments \(Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia\) \[S1\], \[S2\]. This process allowed national wildlife authorities to take stock of progress to date, to incorporate new research, and to revise and update their plans in line with progress and current scientific research \[S1\], \[S2\]. 

-  Developed national capacity for cheetah and wild dog conservation by training, mentoring and supporting National Coordinators in 14 range states, to oversee the implementation of new and existing National Action Plans \[S1\], \[S2\], \[S3\], \[S4\], \[S5\], \[S6\]. Each of these Coordinators is embedded within their national wildlife authority, and their training has included sustainable ways to protect these species while also benefiting local people, allowing cheetahs and wild dogs to survive in human\-dominated landscapes \[S6\]. 

-  Supported the Convention on Migratory Species \(CMS\) to establish a new policy initiative \(the African Carnivores Initiative\) in partnership with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \(CITES\) \[S1\], \[S7\]. This joint Initiative, which started work in 2018, provides an international framework to promote cheetah and wild dog conservation on the huge geographic scales needed, including a recommendation to “ *establish a national coordination structure based on the Range Wide Conservation Programme for Cheetah and Wild Dog to provide technical support, training and mentoring to coordinators and a platform for regular meetings*” \[S7\]. 

-  In partnership with national governments and local experts, facilitated developing the first conservation plans for the species in two Trans\-Frontier Conservation Areas \(TFCAs\); the Kavango\-Zambezi TFCA in Botswana/Namibia/Angola/Zambia/ Zimbabwe \(>500,000km<sup>2</sup>\), and the W\-Arly\-Pendjari\-Oti\-Mandouri TFCA in Benin/Burkina Faso/Niger/Togo \(23,000km<sup>2</sup>\), promoting cheetah and wild dog conservation across international borders \[S2\], \[S4\]. 

-  Established a new conservation initiative in the W\-Arly\-Pendjari\-Oti\-Mandouri TFCA \(23,000km<sup>2</sup>\) to secure habitat and prey for the last cheetah population in West Africa \[S2\], \[S4\]. 

-  Developed a carnivore management plan for the Tsavo ecosystem in Kenya/Tanzania \(24,421km<sup>2</sup>, in partnership with Kenya Wildlife Service, Kenyan NGO Osilalei, and local stakeholders\)  \[S2\], \[S5\], and a management plan for Luando National Park in Angola \(8,737km<sup>2</sup>, in partnership with the Angola Ministry of Environment\) \[S2\]. 

-  Discovered two previously unknown populations of African wild dogs covering 13,000km<sup>2</sup> in the course of surveying protected areas across Angola, a country recovering from decades of conflict \[S8\]. 

-  Initiated a new on\-the\-ground project in Zambia, to help local communities to coexist with wild dogs, cheetahs, and other wildlife, hence securing a vital but unprotected wildlife corridor which connects wild dog and cheetah range in Kafue National Park \(30,680km<sup>2</sup>\), to range in the Kavango\-Zambezi TFCA \(558,189km<sup>2</sup>\) \[S1\], \[S2\]. 

 In addition, demographic evidence that the illegal pet trade poses a serious extinction risk for cheetahs prompted RWCP to: 

-  Work through CITES to raise awareness of the illegal trade in cheetahs among range states, transit, and destination countries. This resulted in a formal assessment of the impact of trade on cheetah populations \(which lists RWCP as one of the organisations contributing information\), and establishment of a cheetah working group within CITES, with Durant as a member \[S1\]. 

-  Provide the first CITES Illegal Trade Resource Kit, to be used by customs and other enforcement officials across the world to address illegal trade in cheetahs, including identifying cheetahs and cheetah products, and ensuring that any confiscated cheetahs are managed appropriately \[S1\], \[S2\]. 

 Moreover, Woodroffe’s evidence that rabies caught from domestic dogs can kill whole packs and devastate wild dog populations prompted her Kenyan PhD student, Dedan Ngatia, to establish the Laikipia Rabies Vaccination Campaign \(LRVC\), which aims to protect both people and wild dogs by vaccinating domestic dogs \[S10\]. Although the World Health Organisation aims to eradicate human rabies by 2030, most efforts have targeted urban areas. Drawing tangible links between human and wildlife health has encouraged donors to support rural rabies control \[S1\], and the LRVC, which is conducted in partnership with Kenya’s national and county governments, and local communities, is estimated have prevented approximately 75 human rabies deaths since its establishment in 2015 \[S5\]. Under the auspices of the RWCP, Woodroffe’s team is now using evidence from their own research, and the experience of the LRVC, to develop disease management plans for wild dogs in Kenya, which are expected to provide a model for other wild dog conservation projects throughout Africa \[S1\], \[S5\]. 

 In a recent independent review after 13 years of operation using the Conservation Excellence Model \(CEM\), the Range Wide Conservation Programme for Cheetah and African Wild Dogs was assigned a score of greater than 500. The assessors noted, that: “ *For comparison, amongst programmes previously assessed against CEM, only two other programmes achieved assessment scores in excess of 500 points, both of which have been established more than 20 years\)*” \[S2\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Zooniverse citizen science projects have reached over 2.22 million people \(1.4 million new people since August 2013\). This impact includes changes of understanding and behaviour of members of the public providing classifications for over 300 different projects, as well as project use in formal and informal education, changes to the behaviour of researchers engaged in new research using citizen science methods, and changes internationally, particularly to environmental policy and disaster relief. Portsmouth has made major contributions to the underpinning and ongoing research for Galaxy Zoo, which was the foundation for the Zooniverse and led directly to its wide impact.

","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The Zooniverse platform \( [www.zooniverse.org](http://www.zooniverse.org/)\) and Portsmouth’s links to it can be traced back to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \[SDSS \(R1\)\] and the closely related Galaxy Zoo project \( [<ins>www.galaxyzoo.org</ins>](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/)\) \- both of which are astronomical collaborations in which Portsmouth researchers have played a leading role. 

 Professor Bob Nichol has been a key member of SDSS since 1993, arriving at Portsmouth's Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation \(ICG\) in 2004. Recent ICG members continue to have leadership roles in ongoing generations of SDSS \(Dr Karen Masters \- SDSS\-IV Spokesperson \- at Portsmouth 2008\-2019; Professor Will Percival \- eBOSS Project Scientist \- at Portsmouth 2005\-2018\). Throughout, SDSS has been central to the modern standard model of Cosmology. 

 The development of digital detector technology enabled astronomical surveys \(including SDSS as the first of these surveying a large fraction of the sky\) to create so many images of galaxies that by 2007 it had become impossible for astronomers to visually inspect all images. Even now, computer\-based algorithms still struggle to do this task as accurately as humans. 

 To overcome the challenge of analysing so many galaxy images, Galaxy Zoo \(GZ\) was launched in 2007 \(zoo1.galaxyzoo.org archives the original site\) by a team that included Portsmouth researchers Nichol, Professor Daniel Thomas and technical help by then Portsmouth based postdoc Dr Edd Edmondson \(now at UCL\). Portsmouth expertise in SDSS and links to the SDSS image server were critical to the smooth running of the site. On July 11, 2007, the GZ project was launched to the public. Within twelve hours, GZ began receiving 20,000 classifications per hour \(peaking at 70,000 per hour on the second day\), driven by a global media interest in the project. After 10 days, the public had submitted 8 million classifications; by early 2008, when the first GZ research papers were published \(Portsmouth lead author\) \(R2\), 100,000 volunteers had inspected more than 900,000 galaxies, each 38 times on average. 

 Early research using GZ classifications, led by Portsmouth researchers Steven Bamford \(UoP 2005\-2008\) \(R2\) and Masters \(R3\) demonstrated the utility of this crowdsourcing technique. These and other works demonstrated without doubt that online citizen science could be used to obtain data useful for scientific studies \(in these examples understanding galaxy evolution\), suggesting that the technique should be expanded to other areas. The early success of GZ \(both as a public engagement project and as a tool for analysing data sets\) directly supported the launch of the Zooniverse platform, designed to support similar projects on any topic. The development of Zooniverse was led by Oxford\-based researchers with key involvement from Portsmouth: Galaxy Zoo was the first project to relaunch on Zooniverse, and Masters was named Galaxy Zoo Project Scientist shortly after launch in recognition of her leadership role. In 2019, the Galaxy Zoo science team won the RAS Group Award. 

 The Zooniverse is now a mature platform; its latest code base enables hundreds of projects to run on the site across many areas of research. Since 2014 Portsmouth has been an official member of the Zooniverse collaboration, and has employed Data Scientist Dr Coleman Krawczyk \(2014\-present\). He works directly with the Zooniverse team to develop new data analysis and visualisation tools, and to help Zooniverse researchers across all projects to obtain effective output from the citizen science input. As well as important ongoing results led by Portsmouth researchers coming out of Galaxy Zoo classifications in the area of galaxy evolution \(R4,R5\), Portsmouth researcher Thomas Collett has been involved in finding gravitational lenses in the Space Warps project \(R6\), and ICG academic staff member Andrew Lundgren is involved in the project which feeds data to Gravity Spy. The data analysis enabled by Zooniverse projects has now touched vast areas of academia, from climate change to ancient language translation.

##  Evidence for the quality of research 

 The underpinning research outlined above was published in foremost international astronomical journals, including robust peer review. The impact factor of these journals is 5.4 to 5.5. 
","
 4. Details of the impact 

 Here we describe the impact from active Zooniverse projects which occurred during the period 2013\-2020. In this period, there was a massive expansion in the number, variety and scope of Zooniverse projects. At the end of 2020, 69 active projects and 334 total projects reside on and operate from the site. Throughout the period since 2014, Portsmouth has hosted a Zooniverse Data Scientist \(Krawczyk\) who has contributed directly to the development and analysis of many Zooniverse projects \(e.g. AnnoTate, Anti\-Slavery Manuscripts, Etch\-a\-cell, Galaxy Builder, Galaxy Zoo, Galaxy Zoo:3D, Gravity Spy, Penguin Watch, Planet Hunters:TESS, Planetary Response Network, SCOTUS Notes, Seabirdwatch\). Portsmouth has commissioned an independent review of the impact of Zooniverse projects, based on published works \(S1\), and this work is discussed below. The Zooniverse has changed participants’ understanding of science, how science is taught both formally and informally, and even how science is done. 

##  Impact on Zooniverse Public Users: actively engaging with research 

 Our citizen science projects have had significant social and cultural impacts through the engagement and general education of hundreds of thousands of community volunteers, as well as by inspiring volunteers to become invested in science. The success of our citizen science projects lies in the visible impact of the volunteers’ work on current research, making citizens part of the scientific process, and changing their opinions about research and science in particular \(S1\-S4\). 

 The reach of Galaxy Zoo \(GZ\) and the Zooniverse of citizen science projects extends to 2.22 million members of the public with registered accounts, 1.4 million of whom have signed up since August 2013. The Zooniverse has been highly successful in attracting both rigorous science projects and volunteers \(S5\-S6\), and since 2016 these volunteers on average make 5.6 million classifications per month \(across all projects\) and also post around 58,000 comments to the projects’ Talk boards each month \(S7\). This has enabled over 330 studies to be completed in areas from the Arts to Medicine, because of the public user participation \(S7\). 

 Studies evaluating the benefits to individuals involved in the Zooniverse \(including by Masters at Portsmouth \(S2\)\) have shown that volunteers measurably learn about science through engaging with the site, even if the projects they engage with do not include direct educational content \(S2\-S4\). The volunteers’ project\-specific science knowledge significantly increases with engagement: an 8% increase with a doubling of the number of active days spent participating \(S2\). Zooniverse involvement is cited by volunteers as contributing to changes in behaviour, sometimes over very long time scales; e.g. PhD student Samantha Youles cites involvement in Zooniverse projects \(2012\-2015\) as a stimulus to obtain a PhD \(S8\). 

##  Impact on University and School Teaching 

 Zooniverse projects are being used in both University teaching and school education. Educational materials based on Zooniverse projects are provided online \( [<ins>https://classroom.zooniverse.org</ins>](https://classroom.zooniverse.org/) and  [<ins>http://zooteach.org/</ins>](http://zooteach.org/)\). Across the USA, approximately 900 university students interact with Astronomy\-related citizen science projects hosted by Zooniverse each year in “Astro101” classes \(S9\). Two NSF\-funded projects have investigated the impact of inclusion of citizen science in Astro 101 classes. In particular Trouille et al created a Classroom Zooniverse portal, through which students and teachers could access citizen science astronomy materials; they describe an increase in understanding of science and how astronomers obtain their data among 725 students in 10 different Astro101 classes who engaged in this programme \(S10\). Comments from students include *“\[Analysing\] the data taught us how easily scientific data can be manipulated and how important it is to know what data set was used and if any data was excluded in reaching a conclusion”*, and *“Through conducting this research project, we found that the nature of science has deep roots in creativity”*. \(S10\) 

 School pupils are also interacting with the Zooniverse. In 2020, remote learning materials were in demand, with over 4000 views of Zooniverse online learning resources that year \(S9\). Also in 2020, 900 volunteer hours were provided by 9th\-12th grade pupils attending the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair \(S11\). One attendee from Brazil said, *“Participating in this experience made me think of other social science issues that I could dedicate myself to.”* Zooniverse projects in schools provide an authentic insight into how science gets done, e.g. one teacher reflected that *“Galaxy Zoo enables kids to discover how the hard work of real science opens their minds, and makes them curious about their world.”* One of her middle school pupils remarked, *“Overall, I think that Galaxy Zoo can really help students learn and also helps advance science.”* \(S12\). 

##  Impact on Public Institutions 

 Museums in both the UK and the USA use Zooniverse materials in a variety of exhibits, bringing Zooniverse projects to a broader audience base that may not engage with online content. In the UK, the Solar Storm Watch Zooniverse project is featured in the Greenwich Observatory Astronomy Exhibit. In the USA, the Adler Planetarium in Chicago has a formal partnership with Zooniverse, through which approximately 50,000 guests to the planetarium per year interact with Zooniverse projects. This has included, from September 2019 to April 2020, a Galaxy Zoo touch table exhibit \(for which Masters was a consultant\) \(S9\). Visitors select galaxies and choose which category they fall into, while Adler facilitators are present to explain the research process; participants generate over one thousand classifications per day. 

##  Impact on Researchers: empowering citizen science research 

 Galaxy Zoo, followed by many Zooniverse projects, has demonstrated the power of citizen science for peer\-reviewed research. A next step in our facilitation of citizen science came with the development of Project Builder at Zooniverse.org from 2015, led by a team including Krawczyk in Portsmouth. This online tool simplifies the development of new projects, and has led to an explosion in the number of researchers making use of the platform for their research. As well as the 69 live peer\-reviewed Zooniverse projects \(12/2020\), there are now over 9,000 projects worldwide that have been built on the platform, and more than 300 have collected over 100 classifications each, demonstrating how Project Builder is making citizen science techniques widely available \(S7\). 

 Interaction with the public via Zooniverse is causing changes of attitude amongst researchers \(S1\); e.g. a senior member of the Galaxy Zoo team, Professor Bill Keel \(University of Alabama\) reflected that *“Working with Galaxy Zoo* [ ](https://twitter.com/galaxyzoo) *volunteers got me to start posting on submission so they could read it \- and as a plus, I often got immediate feedback at least as useful as from a journal referee. So my default has evolved.”* \(S12\). Researchers are learning new ways to interact with the public through the Zooniverse platform; if more volunteer activity is wanted, then two approaches have been found to be necessary \(S1\): to have more personalised messaging with users who may consider leaving, and to find ways of making tasks appealing through gamification. In this way, interacting with Zooniverse classifiers is impacting researcher behaviour, in two way public engagement. 

##  Changing policy and practice: environment and disaster response 

 Zooniverse projects, directly supported by Portsmouth, are making an international impact on policy and practice. Two examples are: 

 \(a\) **Penguin Watch** \(2014\-present\): in this project, volunteers count penguins in images of South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula, to understand their changing population. Krawczyk \(Portsmouth\) designed the pipeline turning volunteer clicks into penguin counts. The project's evidence, that the penguin population declined in some areas from year to year, was provided to the Government of South Georgia with recommendations for extending the Marine Protected Area \(MPA\) around the islands. This led \(in 2018\) to the government announcing a major extension to the MPA of 300,000sq km \(S13 &S14\), protecting marine habitat from exploitation and preventing further decline of the penguin population. 

 \(b\) The **disaster relief** project “Planetary Response Network” asks users to identify where storm damage to human settlements has occurred, by comparing old and new satellite images of particular areas. Krawczyk was responsible for post\-processing the satellite images for Zooniverse presentation. Volunteer identifications allowed the rapid creation of damage maps of islands such as Puerto Rico, Dominica and St Thomas, following the Caribbean storms in 2017. The maps enabled disaster response charity Global Rescue to concentrate their relief efforts \(S15\). Planetary Response Network continues to be developed in readiness for future disasters.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 European law protects all bat species, and infrastructural development must not have a negative effect on bat populations. Altringham and Berthinussen conducted research to develop effective monitoring and mitigation strategies to enable roads and railways to be built without significantly affecting the ability of bats to move freely and safely through landscapes severed by new infrastructure. This research informed guidance developed for Defra. The guidance has been widely disseminated and the mitigation recommendations have been incorporated into official guidance in the UK, New Zealand and the EU. These guidelines have been used in six road schemes and two rail schemes that have been constructed/are being constructed in the UK and incorporated into proposals for four other road and two other rail schemes \(including HS2\) in the UK, plus additional schemes in Austria and Croatia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Altringham and Berthinussen \( **R1**\) demonstrated for the first time that major roads significantly reduce bat numbers, foraging activity and diversity. The negative impact of a major road was shown to stretch a considerable distance beyond the actual road, with bat activity three times lower at the roadside than 1.6 km away. Mitigation prior to this work should in principle have made roads more permeable and safe for bats to cross, and improved adjacent habitat. However, existing mitigation measures were shown to be ineffective or of unknown effectiveness, indicating the need for evidence\-based designs for mitigation and monitoring of effectiveness. 

 The effectiveness of two commonly used mitigation measures for bats was assessed by Altringham and Berthinussen \( **R2**\). Three underpasses and four bat gantries were investigated in northern England. They found that underpasses could be an effective means of mitigation if located on pre\-construction commuting routes, but were ineffective if placed in a location away from the bats’ established commuting routes. They found that bat gantries \(elevated wire ‘guides’\) were ineffective. Most bats near gantries crossed roads along severed, pre\-construction commuting routes at heights that put them in the path of vehicles. They recommended that green bridges \(wide and planted with trees and shrubs\) should be explored as an alternative form of mitigation. The research clearly demonstrated that robust monitoring is essential to assess objectively the case for mitigation and to ensure effective mitigation. 

 They have also developed multiscale habitat suitability models \(HSMs\) for bats in the Lake District, \( **R3**\). Acoustic surveys were used to gather presence data for eight bat species from 30 sites, and to develop and assess a number of multiscale models. The best models were used to predict habitat suitability across the landscape and provide insights into the potential impacts of land‐use and environmental change. HSMs identify areas of conservation concern that may be affected by new transport infrastructure, and are thus useful for ecological impact assessment \(EIAs\) of proposed developments. 

 **Defra contract, research, report and guidance**: Following their research \( **R1, R2**\) JA and AB were commissioned by the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs \(Defra\) in 2013 to conduct further research, to develop standardised and cost\-effective methods for assessing the effects of linear transport infrastructure on bats, and to test the effectiveness of mitigation, such as crossing structures \( **R4**\). They developed and tested these methods \(2013\-2014\) while also assessing the effects of multiple road and rail schemes in the UK on bats, and the effectiveness of some currently used mitigation measures. The research enabled methods to be developed which are quantitative, robust, replicable, and produce data suitable for statistical analysis – all of which were absent from existing common practice prior to 2013. Importantly, these methods also allow for comparisons to be made before, during and after construction. The research carried out through this contract, together with the previous research \( **R1\-3**\), enabled JA and AB to develop research\-informed guidelines for road and rail developers, which have been widely used \(see section 4\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Introduction/context – what is the problem that needs solving?**  Improvement of transport infrastructure through the building of roads and railways is a priority of many countries, to support economic development. However, such structures frequently have deleterious effects on wildlife, including bats, which have to cross them when moving through their habitat. UK and European law protects all species of bats, which means that all construction work must not have a negative effect on bat populations. Builders/road developers must provide effective mitigation to enable bats to move freely and safely through the altered landscapes. Bats make up \~30% of UK/European terrestrial mammal species and are amongst the most threatened. There was a need for robust evidence to assess the effectiveness of mitigation approaches in use before 2012 \( **R1, R2**\), which included overhead gantries and underpasses. An understanding of the potential impacts of land‐use and environmental change on habitat suitability for bats \( **R3**\) was also required, together with clear guidelines for the developers of road and rail schemes, to enable them to construct and test effective mitigation structures and fulfil their legal obligations \( **R4**\). 

 **Defra contract \- research into guidance**: Clear survey and data analysis protocols were created for use by conservation practitioners and the consultancy industry and recommendations were made for best practice mitigation solutions for future linear transport infrastructure schemes. Importantly, the guidelines also allow for comparisons to be made before, during and after construction. The final report to Defra containing the research and the guidelines **\(R4\)** has been disseminated at numerous national and international conferences. The recommendations made in the Defra report were disseminated through three workshops \(September 2016 – September 2017\) commissioned by the professional body CIEEM \(Chartered Institute for Ecology and Environmental Management\). The course provided an overview of the research **\(R1\-4\)** and detailed instructions for following the methods and recommendations. Attendees \(61\) included ecologists \(graduate level through to company directors\) from independent consultancies as well as County Councils, Network Rail and Wildlife Trusts. 

 **Incorporation of guidelines into linear infrastructure proposals:** 

 **In the UK**, the UK Guidance note for UK Statutory Nature Conservation agencies \(published on Natural Resources Wales website – **\[Source A\]**\) is based on the Defra report. This Guidance note and the Defra report have been used \(to date\) to inform and/or change fourteen plans and proposals for road and rail schemes throughout the UK, eight of which have been/are being constructed. The guidelines have also been used in a number of other countries, being incorporated into recommendations, and also have been used to inform the development of several overseas linear infrastructure proposals. 

 **1.** For **road developments**, the Defra guidance has been used to inform proposals for **six schemes which have been/are being constructed \[Source B\]**: 

 **a.** **M20 Junction 10a, Kent, UK.** In July 2016, Highways England referred to the Defra research in their Protected Species Report on bats for the M20 Junction 10a road scheme in Kent using this to inform the proposed mitigation, which consisted of underpasses with tree planting on either side. Page 46: *“Recent studies \(Berthinussen & Altringham 2015\) have found no evidence to support the effective use of wire gantry structures \(built for the purposes of providing an echolocation guide for bats over roads\) in maintaining commuter routes. Overbridges were also found to not be utilised. Therefore more naturalised structures are recommended as these are more likely to be effective.”* The application was granted development consent by the Secretary of State for Transport in Dec 2017; work commenced in January 2018, and was completed in early 2020 **.** 

 **b. Arborfield Cross Relief Road, Wokingham, England:** in the Environmental Statement for this scheme \(2017\), Wokingham Borough Council asked for the Defra guidelines to be referenced during consultation. The scheme is a new 2.3 km bypass that has the potential to have impacts on at least nine bat species. Page 4: “ *the ecological submission should include discussion regarding the selection of bat survey methods with reference to guidelines for bat survey to inform linear infrastructure projects published in 2015 \(Berthinussen & Altringham 2015\).*” This scheme is now completed, with a green bridge crossing for wildlife, and opened 17<sup>th</sup> November 2020. 

 **c. A30 Chiverton to Carland Cross, Cornwall, England.** Highways England refer to the Defra report in both the Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report \(2017\) and Preliminary Environmental Information Report \(2018\) for this road. The A30 Chiverton to Carland Cross involves the construction of 12.7km of new dual carriageway and will affect multiple bat species \(including several rare species, such as barbastelle, and lesser and greater horseshoe bats\). A Development Consent Order \(DCO\) was granted on 6 February 2020 which allows the design as submitted to the planning inspectorate to be built. A contract for the work was awarded to Costain \(31 March 2020\), and preliminary works for the scheme have begun. 

 **d.** **A120 Little Hadham Bypass, Hertfordshire, UK.** The Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust \(HMWT\) referred to the Defra research in their Consultation Response to the A120 Little Hadham bypass in Hertfordshire on the 9th of December 2015. This is a 3.9km single carriageway bypass, which will disturb an important colony of barbastelle bats. Page 4: *“Guidance on appropriate survey, assessing impacts and appropriate mitigation for road schemes is provided the DEFRA research report WC1060. The ecological report submitted in support of this proposal should utilise this research to demonstrate that the scheme will not result in unacceptable levels of disturbance that would negatively impact this Annex II species.”* The objections raised by HMWT resulted in mitigation design changes and additional survey work being carried out prior to the planning application, submitted in October 2016. Construction started in July 2019 and is currently scheduled for completion in late summer 2021. 

 **e.** The Environmental Statement for the **A496 Llanbedr Access Improvement, Gwynedd, Wales** uses the Defra report to inform the mitigation plans for habitat connectivity, which affects eight bat species. This scheme was approved on 4<sup>th</sup> March 2020, including mitigation plans for bats. 

 **f. Preston Western Distributor and East West Link Road, Lancashire, UK.** Jacobs UK Ltd. referred to the Defra research in their Bat outline mitigation strategy prepared for Lancashire County Council in April 2016 as part of the Preston Western Distributor \(PWD\) and East West Link Road \(EWLR\) Environmental Impact Assessment \(EIA\). The Defra research was used to inform the proposed mitigation, which included underpasses and an environmental overbridge. Page 6: *“The latest academic research was…considered and includes…. “Berthinussen and Altringham \(2015\); and Natural England \(2015\).”* This scheme is now under construction. 

 **2. Use of Defra guidance in road proposal developments:** there are four schemes **\[Source C\]** that utilise the Defra guidance: A9/A96 upgrades, Scotland; M4 relief road, Gwent levels, Wales; Ashton park urban extension/relief road, Wiltshire; and A30 Honiton\-Devonshire Inn, Devon. 

 **3: Four rail scheme proposals** use the DEFRA guidelines in the Impact Assessments and Environmental Statements **\[Source D\]**: 

 **a. High Speed rail 2 \(HS2, Phase 1\), Bernwood Forest:** JA and AB have provided ongoing advice to Berks, Bucks and Oxon Wildlife Trust \(BBOWT\) since 2014 about the potential impact of HS2 Phase 1 on rare Bechstein’s bats in the Bernwood Forest area of Buckinghamshire. The likely effectiveness of proposed mitigation has been assessed through reviewing and reporting on numerous Environmental Statements and appearing \(JA\) as an expert witness in front of a parliamentary select committee in November 2015. From BBOWT website: *“As a direct result of our campaigning with The Wildlife Trusts nationally, and with the help of experts Prof John Altringham and Dr Anna Berthinussen from the University of Leeds, we secured:* 

-  *“….A commitment for Green Bridges to be built where the line passes through the Bernwood Forest area. These will have 30m wide ‘green’ planting of grass and trees. The HS2 route through Bernwood Forest bisects a colony of Bechstein’s bats, one of the UK’s rarest mammals. BBOWT also secured extensive mitigation proposals for woodland creation in Bernwood Forest.* 

-  *Changes to the Bill to ensure that bats can use the planned underpasses….”* 

 **Natural England** also requested that monitoring plans for HS2 were informed by the Defra research. In April 2020 the government announced that Phase 1 of HS2 could proceed. 

 **b. High Speed rail 2 \(Phase 2a\), West Midlands to Crewe, England:** In the Technical Appendices of the Environmental Statement prepared for Phase 2a of High Speed rail 2 \(HS2\) in July 2017, the Defra report is referenced and used to inform survey methodologies. Phase 2a is the second stage of the HS2 line running between London and the north of England, *“Proposed survey methodologies are largely based on the Bat Workers Manual, Bat Mitigation Guidelines and Bat Surveys: Good Practice Guidelines 3rd Edition. Reference has also been made to the survey methods recommended within Design Manual for Roads and Bridges Volume 1050, and the Defra research report WC1060”.* 

 **c.** The **East West Rail Phase 2**, southern England. The Ecology Technical Appendix on Field Survey Standards \(part of the EIA\) for this scheme, published in April 2017, referenced the Defra report and based their proposals for surveys on the Defra methods. This is a significant scheme involving the introduction of direct rail passenger services between Oxford, Milton Keynes and Bedford, and between London and Milton Keynes, *“Proposed survey methodologies are largely based on best practice methodology contained within the following resources: Berthinussen A & Altringham J \(2015\) …*” Phase two of this section \(Bicester to Bedford\) was approved by the Secretary of State for Transport on 4 February 2020 allowing main construction work to start. 

 **d. South Wales Metro:** In the Strategic Habitat Regulations Assessment screening report for the South Wales Metro \(August 2017\), the Defra report is referenced several times and its findings are used to assess the potential impact of this rail scheme on bats. This is a significant scheme involving the construction of a new ‘Metro’ network \(including rail and bus routes\) across ten local authorities which form the Cardiff Capital Region, “ *A report by Berthinussen, A. and Altringham, J. \(2015\) reported that railways have a comparable impact on bats to roads, …., we can use the same principals of the impacts of bats on roads to assess the impact of the plan*”. This scheme has been approved, construction work began on 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2020. 

 **Incorporation of guidance into UK conservation organisation guidelines:** In the Bat Conservation Trust’s \(BCT\) third and newest edition of ‘Good Practice Guidelines’ Bat Surveys for Professional Ecologists \(2016, **\[Source E\]**\), the reader is referred to the Defra research for guidance on monitoring road and rail schemes, *“Berthinussen and Altringham \(2015\) provide information on pre\- and post\-construction surveys of linear infrastructure schemes, designed specifically to assess the effectiveness of mitigation for bats crossing them.”* 

 **Impact of this work beyond the UK**: The **European** guidance document “Roads and Wildlife Manual” which makes use of the DEFRA report was published in May 2018 for the Conference of European Directors of Roads **\[Source F\]**. Prior to this JA and AB were involved in the production of EU guidance documents on bats and linear transport infrastructure for CEDR as part of a transnational research programme, attending a workshop in Denmark in February 2016 to discuss and share knowledge on the current situation on bats, roads and mitigation. Twenty\-two delegates from 10 different European countries attended the workshop. 

 Guidelines from Defra report have been referred to in documentation for **EU road schemes in Croatia and Austria** \(2015\-2017\) **\[Source G\]**. In December 2016, the Republic of Croatia Ministry of Environmental Protection \(MZOE\) referred to the Defra research and guidelines in a response to a request to build a 12.2 km road development, from Saborsko – Rakovica, by Croatian Roads. The proposals were considered to have significant adverse impacts on barbastelle and lesser horseshoe bats. Page 4 \(translated from Croatian\): *“For research, possible mitigation measures and a monitoring program for target bats, we recommend using a methodological approach to best practice examples such as: Berthinussen and Altringham \(2015\)*.” In May 2017, the Defra research was cited in a review of an EIA \(Environmental Impact Assessment\) for the L5181 Spange Wörth \(Austria\) road development by LANIUS, which raises objections about the survey work carried out and the lack of appropriate mitigation proposals. The research is referenced in relation to the effectiveness of green bridges, which are recommended as a mitigation measure. 

 The Defra methods were put forward as a template for adoption as a best practice framework by the **New Zealand Transport Agency \(NZTA, 2017\)**. The Defra report is being used to inform the work and the methods have been put forward as a template for adoption. The final report for this project is available on the NZTA website. The Defra research is described in detail and is cited frequently in relation to both survey methods and mitigation measures **\[Source H\].** 

 The research is referenced in the French manual “Bats and transport infrastructure guidelines”, **French Government, 2016**, in relation to the impact of large infrastructure schemes on bats \(page 23\) **\[Source I\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by the School of Economics at the University of Kent resulted in recommendations to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization \(FAO\) to provide internationally comparative statistics on family farming. As a result, FAO created the digital ‘Family Farming Knowledge Platform’, providing statistics and policy information to governments, NGOs, and farmers. The statistics are helping to improve policies on family farming. 

 Furthermore, research by the School enabled the implementation of two new policies in Kosovo to lift the poorest farmers out of poverty. The first provides grants to help farmers with commercialisation. The second advances a bottom\-up, LEADER\-type approach to rural development, supporting investment in human capital and cooperation projects to mitigate rural out\-migration. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The body of research that underpins the impact outlined in this case study was undertaken by Professor Davidova and Professor Bailey \(both Professors of Agricultural Economics at Kent\), together with PhD student Alberto Zanni and co\-authors from other UK universities. Davidova is a world\-leading expert on policy for small farmers in European countries. Her research and the resulting impact are motivated by the key contribution of small family farmers to food security and the management of natural resources. 

 **R3** investigated the subjective determinants of farmers’ participation in agricultural markets in Central European countries, characterised by large semi\-subsistence sectors that yield meagre incomes for those involved. Access to technical advisory services and market information were the two factors significant to all sample farmers despite their heterogeneity. While structured information on larger farm businesses is available, data on smaller family farmers is insufficient. This information barrier prevents the more nuanced understanding of the challenges faced by small family farmers in their market integration, and thus the implementation of evidence\-based policies. The findings concerning imperfect information **\[R3\]** formed the basis of Davidova’s policy recommendations to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization \(FAO\) **\[R4\]** to improve statistics in order to monitor the development of family farms and their policy needs, and contributed to the eventual implementation of a digital platform that enables knowledge exchange. 

 **R1**, **R2**, **R5** and **R6**, in turn, formed the basis for two new policies that were implemented in Kosovo to improve the economic viability of family farmers. **R2** recommended the introduction of policy support to facilitate increased market integration of semi\-subsistence farms in order to bring longer\-term welfare benefits and help mitigate short\-run costs and risks. **R2** suggested that, in order to be effective, this support should be conditional on measures to increase the human capital of beneficiaries. **R6** provided further evidence that investment in human capital should be prioritised. Employing a dynamic model, it formulated two hypotheses concerning the incremental output effect of family labour: \(1\) the motivation hypothesis, based on the lower monitoring costs associated with family members in comparison to hired workers; and \(2\) the management capabilities deterioration hypothesis, linked to the restricted pool of family labour, which may not possess the required skills. The empirical application showed that on low technical\-efficiency farms the management capabilities deterioration effect offsets any positive effects of loyalty of family labour, calling for the training of family labour. 

 However, improving the wellbeing of small family farmers depends not only on agricultural policy, but also on rural development in areas that host these farmers in order to mitigate pushed rural out\-migration. The research on Kosovo revealed a significant adverse effect of rural out\-migration on farm technical efficiency **\[R5\]**. **R1** employed a discrete choice experiment in an underdeveloped region of rural Slovenia, which shares a common economic history with Kosovo, to provide understanding on how to manage rural labour adjustments in a country in transition. Results revealed that when faced with a choice of jobs and residence, individuals consider not only the wage, but also non\-pecuniary factors, in particular service infrastructure. These results show that policy\-makers should be informed about inhabitants’ preferences in order to mitigate out\-migration by designing policies that achieve a better distribution of service infrastructure across the territory.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Global Impact on Information Provision enabling Improved Policies on Family Farming** 

 The United Nations recognised the key contributions of family farmers and the need of adequate policy response on a global scale by declaring 2014 as the International Year of Family Farming. Professor Davidova’s longstanding research expertise on small semi\-subsistence farmers led to her being invited to contribute to global UN events. Davidova’s Background Report, commissioned by the UN FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia **\[R4\]**, drove awareness in the FAO Member Nations of the need for information on family farming and policy impact assessment. The report was presented on 11\-12 December 2013 in Brussels at the FAO Regional Dialogue for Europe and Central Asia on ‘Family Farming: Working Towards a Strategic Approach to Promote Food Security and Nutrition’, where Davidova acted as keynote speaker **\[a\]**. The meeting had a wide reach, involving around 100 stakeholders from 27 countries, including representatives of governments, UN, NGOs, and farmers' organisations **\[b\]**. FAO uploaded a summary of the report, emphasising that it ‘aims at facilitating the Regional Dialogue for Europe and Central Asia, and the preparation of the outcome document’ **\[c\]**. 

 One of the policy recommendations in the report was for FAO to provide internationally comparative statistics on family farming, and to regularly assess whether policies are conducive to family farmers. Subsequently, in October 2014, at the Global Dialogue on Family Farming, summarising the lessons learnt from the Regional Dialogues, FAO presented the decision to launch a digital ‘Family Farming Knowledge Platform’ to ‘facilitate policy discussions, policy design and decision making by providing easy online access to sources and fostering knowledge and information dissemination’ **\[d\]**. The Platform was launched in 2015, and provides a wide range of resources and statistics to governments, NGOs and farmers. 

 **Implementing Better Policies on Family Farming in Kosovo to Improve Commercialisation** 

 As a result of Davidova longstanding research on semi\-subsistence family farmers in Europe, as well as her expertise in working with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs \(MAFRD\) in Kosovo **\[e\]**, she was invited by the FAO Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia to contribute to the project ‘Capacity Development of MAFRD in Kosovo to Improve Commercialisation of Small and Family Farmers \(TCP/KOS/: 3602\)’ **\[f\]**. The policy recommendations stemming from the underpinning research were presented by Davidova at a stakeholders’ workshop in MAFRD in December 2018, involving Ministry and Agricultural Development Agency officials, farmers’ organisations, NGOs, and foreign donors, with a call for actions **\[g\]**. Subsequently, Davidova and Bailey organised a policy workshop at the University of Kent, with the participation of FAO, representatives of MAFRD, the World Bank, and other organisations to discuss the practical implementation of research recommendations. 

 During the follow\-up three\-day bilateral meeting with the Permanent Secretary of MAFRD and the Chief Executive of Agricultural Development Agency in Kosovo, an agreement was reached to introduce two new policies to help overcome the low level of market integration of family farmers and to generate a bottom\-up LEADER approach to rural development **\[h\]**. These policies have already been implemented. The first new policy provides for start\-up grants to semi\-subsistence farmers designed to promote market engagement through increase in their assets, accompanied by training. This is a major policy improvement, since it lifts asset\-poor households out of poverty. The second policy is related to rural development measures, designed to curb rural out\-migration. In the first year of implementation, around 600 grants were disbursed. The implementation of the LEADER approach supported 12 Local Action Groups, involving the local population with a focus on upskilling and developing cooperation projects **\[i\]**. 

 The research impact on implementation of these new policies has relevance for countries in the wider FAO Europe and Central Asia region, which are populated by small family farms facing high transaction costs to increase their market engagement **\[j\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Lee and her colleagues have changed the lives of Children Born of War \(CBOW\) present and future by highlighting and addressing the significant challenges they face, shaping discourse and policy and mitigating against discrimination and stigmatisation. They have achieved demonstrable impact in three main areas: 

1.  **Initiated policy development and changes in practice** at an international level through sustained engagement with key stakeholders, such as the UN. 

1.  **Changed the self\-perception of CBOW** through participatory approaches and the co\-creation of cultural artefacts, enabling them to take ownership of their life stories. 

1.  **Empowered CBOW to challenge stigmatisation and discrimination** in their societies, including in Norway, Germany, Austria, Vietnam, Haiti, DRC and Uganda. CBOW have found a voice, raised awareness of the health, wellbeing and legal challenges they face and increased empathy, through inclusive processes and cultural artefacts.

 Initiated by an AHRC Research Networking grant on Children Born of War \(CHIBOW\) \(2011\), Lee developed a series of international and interdisciplinary research collaborations, which enhanced the research source base and understanding of sexual exploitation and abuse \(SEA\) and gender\-based violence \(GBV\) in conflict and the experiences of CBOW \(conceived in both consensual and exploitative/abuse relationships\) in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Lee’s initial research focus on World War II expanded through the Initial Training Network \(ITN\) project she led \(2015–2019\), which constructed the first comprehensive comparative study of CBOW, covering armed conflicts, occupations and peacekeeping missions in four continents across the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. 

 The project created a new evidence base: culturally appropriate and ethically sensitive research methodologies were developed through interdisciplinary collaborations. Research with CHIBOW ITN partner Bartels led to the most extensive narrative data capture around peacekeeper\-fathered children to date \(including the first qualitative interview material with children aged six upwards\). \[RO1, RO2\] 

 As PI on a number of grants, Lee has worked collaboratively with scholars in Global Public Health \(Bartels\), socio\-legal studies \(Bunting\), anthropology \(Apio\) and psychology \(Glaesmer and Kaiser\) in conducting fieldwork. Utilising participatory research approaches has shaped Lee’s work deeply and has informed the data and analysis. Findings arising from this extensive research include: 

 **RF1\)** Enhanced understanding of the historically contextualised life\-courses of CBOW conceived in conflicts across Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, including specific analyses of childhood adversities, human rights challenges, economic and psychosocial disadvantages, and physical and mental health challenges. \[RO3, RO5, RO6\] 

 **RF2\)** Historically and culturally sensitive comparative analysis of CBOW experiences resulted in a more nuanced understanding of the specificities of CBOW experiences as well as identifying patterns of such experiences independent of geopolitical and historical contexts. 

 **RF3\)** Historical\-anthropological insights into the impact of kinship and patriarchal social structures on the integration of CBOW and their mothers into fragile post\-conflict societies have resulted in better understanding of how specific cultural norms, customary laws around marriage laws, bride wealth and lineage making, as well as implementation of inheritance laws, lead to inequalities of social, educational and economic opportunities. This led to new insights into barriers to integration for enemy\-fathered children and their mothers into fragile post\-conflict societies. \[RO3\] 

 **RF4\)** The first conceptualisation of CBOW rights as part of the human rights and child rights discourse led to a substantially enhanced understanding of the rights\-based approaches on which support and assistance for victims and survivors of SEA and GBV is now based. 

  

 The research has thus improved definitional clarity and contributed to a genuinely comparative analysis of CBOW experiences across time and space.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Lee’s research and collaboration has achieved significant impact in three main areas: 

1.  **Initiated policy development and changes in practice within international organisations and nation states** 

 **Policy development at the United Nations \(UN\)** was affected by raising awareness of the CBOW and the absence of mechanisms to support them emotionally, socially and legally. **Better UN support mechanisms were introduced** as a result of Lee engaging with UN personnel across different offices and departments, highlighting the particular needs of CBOW. This included the inclusion of a rights\-based approach to victim support \(UNSCR2467\) and the appointment of a Victims Rights Advocate in August 2017 as a champion, among others, of the support and assistance of children born of conflict\-related sexual exploitation and abuse. 

 **Multiple policy audiences and the UN were further engaged through a multi\-layered sustainable media strategy**, starting in 2014, in multiple languages and countries, targeting platforms such as BBC, ORF, MDR, GEO, *Times*, *NYT*, *Libération*, CNN and GI \(the biggest online platform in Brazil\). For example, in 2019, the first large\-scale historically contextualised analysis of community perceptions of UN Peacekeeping and CBOW was read over 120,000 times in the first month and was picked up across different international outlets, increasing the visibility of the topic among policy makers. In response, the UN Victims’ Rights Advocate and the Assistant Secretary General for Human Resources contacted Lee and Bartels and asked them to collaborate on improving reporting structures around SEA and GVB by peacekeepers and thus to provide more effective victim support. \[S1\] Similarly, the analysis also directly led to policy development and action in Chile on the issue of CBOW. In January 2020, the Chilean Congress approved the creation of a commission to investigate cases of abuse in Haiti. The CNN Chile news anchor stated that, ‘the research has been very relevant’ to the establishment of the Commission. \[S3\] 

  

 Examples of further impact at the international level are: 

-  **Informed, supported and changed the UN’s data collection process**: CBOW data has been used in the annual report of the UNSRSG for Sexual Violence in Conflict every year since 2015. \[RO2, RO4; S1\] Since 2014, Lee has fed research insights \[RF1, RF2, RF3\] into central and in\-country offices within the UN, including the Office for UNSRSG Sexual Violence in Conflict, who attested that Lee ‘was the person who got us to start focusing on the issue,’ as well as the Victims’ Rights Advocate and the in\-country UN Women Protection Gender Advisor. \[S1\] 

-  **Raised awareness and shifted policy on CBOW issues on the UN Security Council \(UNSC\)**: Evidenced by the inclusion of matters relating to CBOW, as distinctive concerns since 2015, on various UNSCR’s on Women, Peace and Security \(WPS\), most recently in UNSCR2467. Additionally, under the supervision of Lee, Apio’s work was instrumental in CBOW issues being placed on the agenda of the UN Security Council in March 2015. Apio’s invited presentation at the Open Debate of the Security Council raised the profile of the issue and directly informed the SC debates. \[S2\] In response, the UN Security Council President asserted that ‘we must recognise that reintegration is a long\-term effort that requires the collective responsibility of all stakeholders, including the international community’. \[S2\] 

-  **Improved practices and training at the UN** by shaping new training and directly influencing UN practitioners. In response to a parallel study on peacekeeper\-fathered children in the DRC and Haiti \[RO1\], the UN invited Lee to contribute to its ongoing \(2018–present\) critical evaluation of UN peacekeeping training. Their input revealed inadequate coverage of culturally contingent CBOW issues and led to a reconsideration of best practice in training. \[S1\] Lee and Bartels are currently working with UN Women Protection Gender Advisor to update training guidance. The pilot, which was planned to take place summer 2020, has been postponed until summer 2021 due to Covid\-19. 

1.  **Changed self\-perception of CBOW through participatory approaches and the co\-creation of cultural artefacts, enabling them to take ownership of their life stories** 

 The research has **significantly shifted self\-perception within the CBOW community** through active inclusion in the research \(RO2, RO3, RO4\). Participatory approaches directly engaged with target communities in Norway, Germany, Austria, Vietnam, Haiti, DRC and Uganda. CBOW used engagement in research to process psychosocial challenges and create space for new self\-perception. A 2015 GEO article on *Russenkinder* recorded how some CBOW participants in Germany reported a sense of ‘normality \[…\] replacing shame and shyness’ **,** leading some to claim that they now feel ‘proud’ of their biological origin, ‘felt esteem’ and ‘now have a voice.’ \[S4; S5\] Similarly, participants in the Ugandan chapter spoke of how ‘drastically, I feel my life changed’ reported feeling ‘safer’, ‘proud of who I am’ with a ‘reduction in the level of stress and trauma’ and that the project ‘rebuilt my hope for the future and has built a process of healing’, in stark contrast with former feelings of ‘misfortune that I was born,’ of feeling ‘desperate’ ‘miserable’ and ‘fearful’ in a life ‘full of hatred, stigmatization and rejection’. \[S11\] 

 **New cultural artefacts allowed CBOW to reconstruct identities**. Supported by Lee’s historical contextualisation of their life\-courses \(RO3, RO4, RO6\), CBOW have written biographical and autobiographical pieces, which have further changed their self\-perception, resulting in ‘new self\-confidence’ and ‘a voice in society that they hitherto had not had \[…\] we no longer feel marginalised’. \[S7\] The German Foreign Ministry facilitated the translation of a CBOW’s book into Bosnian, which further supported the public discourse on the topic of CBOW in former Yugoslavia. The value of collaboration between academic partners and CBOW support groups was specifically mentioned in awarding the *Bundesverdienstkreuz* \(German order of merit\) to one of the participants in 2017 \[S8\]. 

1.  **Empowered CBOW to challenge stigmatisation and discrimination** **in their societies and beyond, and increased empathy through inclusive processes and cultural artefacts** 

 **New support groups \( **Distelblüten**, the Bosnian ‘Association of Forgotten Children of War’\) were established and new foci for activities were found** as a result of CBOW’s active inclusion in research processes \(RO3, RO4\) and the creation of a significant evidence base. Established in response to a CBOW 2015 symposium, for example, since 2018, the Association of Forgotten Children of War has specifically focused on raising public awareness. \[S6\] In 2019, the President of the Association of Forgotten Children of War gave her own speech in the UN chamber as part of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, only a fortnight after two other representatives of the Forgotten Children of War Association spoke at the United Nations at an event of the UNSRSG on Sexual Violence in Conflict. 

 The research has **further increased the international visibility of CBOW** through the creation of new, participatory cultural artefacts. Lee collaborated with award\-winning artistic director Darrel Toulon in the production of a new cultural artefact, the docu\-dance ‘In the Name of the Father’. The performance was choreographed using the interviews with CBOW, some of whom, together with professional actors and dancers, participated in the performance. The President of the Association of the Forgotten Children of War noted that, ‘I felt a tremendous relief when I told my story in front of a full theatre. This show made us visible.’ \[S9\] In December 2019, the production played to full houses at the National Theatre, Tuzla and the Theatre of War, Sarajevo, and it was scheduled for international showings in 2020. The ‘Bosnian chapter’ of ‘In the Name of the Father’, has been supplemented by a ‘Ugandan chapter’, which premiered a performance at Aboke in January 2020 and was set to complete further regional performances in April/May 2020. The psychologist working with the Ugandan participants stated that before the project began participants had ‘trust issues with each other and the trainers’ but that, by the end of the project, participants ‘were socializing more with each other, creating friendships’ and ‘trusting more, opening their walls which they had guarded because of the stigma.’ Some participants actually found siblings amongst the group. Participants were ‘given a platform’ to ‘express their voices’ and were able to ‘advocate for their rights through the medium of art.’ \[S10\] 

 The research has **promoted higher levels of empathy and understanding for CBOW** through new cultural artefacts: Lee’s collaborative research \[RO5\] on the life\-courses of Lebensborn children directly informed the development and production of a BAFTA\-winning mobile game/app. ‘My Child Lebensborn’ is a virtual story\-driven nurture game, which promotes awareness of and empathy for CBOW amongst younger audiences. It is currently rated 4.8 out of 5 on Apple and GooglePlay respectively, based on more than 2,800 reviews, and rated 9.9 of 10 on tap tap. It has been reviewed widely and positively in the press, with the *Guardian* \(9 June 2018\) review praising it as: ‘uniquely effective’ in bringing ‘to vivid life the emotional texture of history’. It was featured among the ‘Best video games of 2018’ in *The New Yorker* \(Simon Parkin, 29 November 2019\) and won the 2019 BAFTA for best ‘Game Beyond Entertainment’.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hypercholesterolaemia remains under\-treated worldwide. Inclisiran is a first\-in\-class, siRNA\-based therapeutic that lowers LDL cholesterol by targeting PCSK9 mRNA. Professor Ray at Imperial College designed and led the clinical trials that demonstrated that inclisiran, given as two injections/year, reduces LDL cholesterol by 50%. It is well tolerated and addresses the challenge of non\-adherence to oral lipid\-lowering drugs. The safety and efficacy data and benefits evident to healthcare resulted in Novartis buying The Medicines Company, the manufacturers of inclisiran, for $9.7 billion and an NHS partnership with Novartis to make the drug available to the NHS for evaluation in 300,000 patients. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease \(CVD\) and reducing low\-density lipoprotein cholesterol \(LDL\-C\) significantly reduces CVD risk. Statins are the standard therapy, but intolerance and reliance on long\-term adherence limit their population impact. Professor Ray and colleagues at Imperial evaluated the association of adherence and treatment intensity with cardiovascular outcomes in patients with documented CVD. The lowest cardiovascular risk was observed among adherent patients receiving high\-intensity therapy, and the highest risk was observed among non\-adherent patients receiving low\-intensity therapy. Suboptimal cholesterol lowering and non\-adherence to treatments requiring daily dosing resulted in 12,000 excess cardiovascular events annually \(1\). 

 Proprotein convertase subtilisin\-kexin type 9 protease \(PCSK9\) is an attractive alternative target for reducing LDL\-C levels; loss\-of\-function mutations in the gene encoding PCSK9 are associated with low LDL\-C levels and reduced risk of heart attack. For over 15 years, PCSK9 has been viewed as intractable to small molecule discovery. Monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 have been developed to lower LDL\-C but require 26 injections annually and are expensive. Inclisiran is a small interfering \(si\)RNA developed by The Medicines Company that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis. 

 In 2015, The Medicines Company approached Professor Ray to design the clinical development programme for inclisiran. He led the design and implementation of the Phase 2 ORION 1 trial, a multi\-centre, double\-blind, multiple\-ascending\-dose trial of inclisiran, administered as a subcutaneous injection to patients at high\-risk for CVD. A total of 501 patients were recruited to compare \(a\) a single dose of placebo with 200/300/500 mg of inclisiran, or \(b\) two doses of placebo with 100/200/300 mg of inclisiran at days 1 and 90. The primary end\-point was the change in LDL\-C level from baseline at 180 days. Results demonstrated that two doses of 300mg of inclisiran maintained a 50% cholesterol reduction over six months \(2\). Further analyses and modelling suggested after two doses 90 days apart, a 6\-monthly dosing regimen could maintain this level of 50% cholesterol reduction \(3\). Professor Ray led the communication of data at conferences and in peer\-review journals, New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA Cardiology, putting forward the concept of time\-averaged reductions in LDL\-C with infrequent dosing \(2, 3\). 

  

 Professor Ray then designed, with the sponsors, three pivotal Phase 3 trials which enrolled approximately 3,600 patients and was the PI of the largest of these, ORION 11. The latter demonstrated that a 6\-monthly dosing schedule sustained a 50% reduction in cholesterol over 18 months \(4\), which was validated by ORION 9 and 10 \(5\). These data showed that this first\-in\-class therapy was effective, safe and well tolerated. The publications reporting this were voted by the Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Society as joint papers of the year and the publication of ORION 10 and 11 was voted by NEJM editors among the 13 top papers they published in 2020 and likely to transform clinical medicine. 

 Professor Ray and Dr Brandts then assessed the population benefits from cumulative exposure to lower cholesterol. Projecting over a 50\-year therapeutic window the cumulative benefits of maintaining the same LDL\-C differences, one might expect a 31.2% relative risk reduction for statins, 41.6% relative risk reduction for monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, and 52% relative risk reduction for siRNAs \(6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CVD is the number one cause of mortality globally. LDL\-C lowering is pivotal to reducing cardiovascular events \(such as heart attacks\), with international guidelines recommending lower LDL\-C targets for those at highest risk. 

 The central approach to achieving these targets has relied upon the use of statins, alone or in combination with other small molecule drugs, which requires patient adherence to a daily dosing regimen. The ORION trials developed and led by Professor Ray at Imperial College represent a paradigm shift in treatment strategy. Inclisiran is a siRNA that inhibits PCSK9 synthesis. siRNA is a novel technology and there was limited experience of its use as a therapeutic agent in humans. By providing compelling evidence that inclisiran is well tolerated and safe when given 6 monthly and that it results in a sustained and clinically important reduction in cholesterol, the ORION trials have opened a new class of therapeutics. Furthermore, by avoiding daily dosing, it enables adherence and the opportunity to meet guidelines for LDL\-C reduction, which translate into a reduction in CVD. A competitor approach, namely monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, requires 26 injections per year. 

 In 2020, the European Medicines Agency and Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use approved inclisiran \(brand name Leqvio\) \[ **A**\]. The data from the ORION studies designed and led by Professor Ray were key to the regulatory approval of inclisiran for hypercholestrolaemia: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

 The potential of this novel first\-in\-class therapy, together with Professor Ray and Dr Brandts’ demonstration of the major population health impact if adopted by healthcare systems, resulted in Novartis buying The Medicines Company and inclisiran for **$9.7 billion**, completed in Jan 2020 \[ **C**\]. Novartis highlighted specifically the results of the comprehensive Phase 3 inclisiran program, which showed potent and durable reduction of >50% in LDL\-C on top of standard of care with an excellent safety profile, as the basis for this acquisition \[ **C**\]. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

 Professor Ray’s report on how the cumulative effects of long\-term uncontrolled LDL\-C placed millions of people at increased cardiovascular risk shaped stakeholder acceptance of inclisiran's unique value proposition. With this understanding, Professor Ray together with The Medicines Company, put forward the proposition that a treatment administered by healthcare professionals in line with clinical practice that overcomes non\-adherence could address some of the healthcare challenges for the NHS in its Long\-Term NHS plan. This has led to a unique partnership between Novartis and the NHS to enable the drug to be made available for 300,000 NHS patients to understand how to best implement this therapy in primary care where the bulk of “at risk patients” are managed \[ **D**\]. This collaboration has the potential to prevent 55,000 heart attacks and strokes and save up to 30,000 lives over the next ten years.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Until recently, recognition of the value of the natural environment for human health was lacking in environmental and health policy. Interdisciplinary research at the *European Centre for Environment and Human Health* based at the University of Exeter has led to a paradigm shift in the integration of health into environmental policy and practice. The research has:

","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 This case study is based on a decade of research led by interdisciplinary academics at the *European Centre for Environment and Human Health* \(‘the Centre’\), since 2019 designated as the *World Health Organisation* \(WHO\) *Collaborating Centre on Natural Environments and Health*, at the University of Exeter Medical School. The Centre, established by Depledge and led by Fleming since 2011, has the explicit purpose of revealing the complex links between the environment and human health. Previously, policy relating to the environment, planning and health was not explicit about capitalising on the health and wellbeing benefits from the natural environment nor on how to maximise them; our work has changed this. We have developed strategically a targeted combination of approaches including observational epidemiology, lab\-based experimental studies, field experiments, economic analyses, qualitative research, evidence synthesis \(including systematic reviews\), and policy and practice analyses to build a coherent body of evidence that has demonstrated, quantified and transformed understanding of the benefits to health and well\-being from natural environments. 

 **i\) How natural environments can promote health** 

 We have pioneered the application of systematic review methodologies to environment and health issues and are core members of the UK Centre for the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. Systematic reviews produce novel understandings through formal evidence synthesis methods, such as meta\-analysis, and are seen as the highest quality evidence for decision making in health and, increasingly, other disciplines. A key early output exemplifying this decade of research was a 2011 systematic review addressing whether participating in physical activity in outdoor natural environments has greater effects on physical and mental wellbeing than physical activity indoors **\[3.1\]**. This was one of the first robust assessments of the state of knowledge on relationships between natural environments and health, which demonstrated that whilst the evidence base was at the time relatively weak, the evidence that did exist was promising. It concluded that *“the paucity of high quality evidence on which to base recommendations…reveals an undoubted need for further research in this area”*. Our later systematic review of the importance of biodiverse environments for health and well\-being **\[3.2\]** flagged the potential of thinking beyond ‘green space vs grey space’ for health and environment to the mutual benefit of each. This also showed key inconsistencies and weaknesses in the evidence base, and again highlighted needs for high quality, interdisciplinary research to better inform decision\-making. 

 **ii\)**  **The scale of health economic values and wellbeing benefit of visits to natural environments** 

 In collaboration with Natural England \(NE\) and Public Health England \(PHE\), we showed that outdoor physical activity in natural environments delivers an estimated £2.2bn of health benefits to adults in England each year **\[3.3\]** \(with economic analyses led by Taylor\). This study used NE’s unique Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment \(MENE\) data to estimate 1.13bn physically active visits to natural environments per year in England and applied standard health economic approaches to assess the associated health values. Further analysis of MENE **\[3.4\]** identified a potential 120\-minute threshold for outdoor activity each week to achieve health gains. The study estimated the relationship between actual time spent outdoors in nature \(as opposed to residential proximity to green spaces\) and self\-reported health and subjective wellbeing. Our analysis identified this possible threshold, and the relationship was not explained through the increased physical activity associated with time outdoors. These studies established a more comprehensive set of health\-related economic values of natural environments than was previously available, which led to the development of the Greenkeeper tool ─ an online tool designed to support planning and investment decisions around urban green infrastructure. 

 **iii\)** **Moving to greener neighbourhoods improves health** 

 Our studies using the 18\-year British Household Panel Survey were among the first to use robust longitudinal approaches to demonstrate that people moving to greener urban neighbourhoods have subsequent better mental health outcomes, and that positive effects last for at least three years following a move **\[3.5\]**. The novel use of long\-term, longitudinal data for a large sample of individuals permitted improved causal inference relative to existing, cross\-sectional evidence at the time. In particular the approach reduced the likelihood that the greenspace\-health association observed is due to selective migration of ‘healthy’ individuals toward greener areas. 

 **iv\)** **Collaborative and embedded research to enhance cross\-sectoral policy and practice** 

 Collaborative synthesis and policy\-focussed research with Defra, NE and other Governmental partners identified opportunities to transform the new Green Infrastructure Standards for England by promoting the importance to public health of improved green infrastructure. Similarly, collaborative research with PHE and Local Authorities in the South West has informed local government planning, environment and land use policy and delivery by transforming how PHE works with local authorities to deliver health improvement through the provision of green infrastructure. Our collaboration with Public Health England in the Health Protection Research Unit in Environmental Change and Health \( *Theme 3: Health and the natural environment* led by Fleming\), resulted in numerous publications on both the risks and benefits of natural environments for health. It demonstrated the value of integrating environmental changes and natural environments into local and national UK public health policy **\[3.6\]**. 

 This large interdisciplinary body of research has demonstrated that the natural environment plays a crucial role in delivering health and wellbeing benefits. We have shown that the scale and likely causal pathways of these benefits have previously been underestimated and undefined, and the opportunity missed by both health and environment sectors.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Human health and wellbeing depend on the environment and well\-functioning ecosystems. This linkage was historically poorly recognised in both environment and health policy. Research from the Centre has changed policy mind\-sets, strategies and practice. Our evidence has strengthened conservation, environmental management and investment policy at scales from local to international by explicitly clarifying the role of natural capital in supporting human health and wellbeing. 

 Traditionally, environmental policies relating to human health have been dominated by hazards; our evidence means these are now balanced by the recognition of the health and wellbeing benefits of good quality natural environments. Our research impact has been amplified through active engagement and close collaborations with policy bodies who have recognised our expertise and invited participation in a range of expert advisory roles and joint projects. 

 **4.1 Influencing international policy and practice on natural environment and health** 

 Our research has led to changes in international policy and strategy in both the environment and health sectors. Since 2015, we have worked with the Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\) and the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) Regional Office for Europe on urban greenspace, biodiversity and health. Our 2014 systematic review **\[3.2\]** of links between biodiverse environments and ‘good’ health was a primary resource used to inform the ratification of two key CBD decisions on biodiversity and human health, with a joint CBD/WHO report **\[5.1\].** These decisions invite the 195 nation state signatories, and the European Union, to act on the linkages in developing health and environmental strategies \(COP12 decision XII/21; COP13 decision XIII/6\) **\[5.1\]**. These international decisions set the context for national policy\-making, including the UK Government 25 Year Plan for the Environment **\[5.2a\]**. 

 Recognition of our research outputs and expertise led to Depledge contributing one of three chapters of the key WHO evidence review underpinning WHO urban greenspace action **\[5.3\]**. Researchers at the Centre subsequently attained membership of an Expert Group advising WHO, ultimately resulting in WHO’s “Urban green spaces: a brief for action” for authorities promoting and supporting action for urban greenspaces. The WHO’s Urban Health Equity officer said *“…this understanding of what matters is something where Exeter was different to many academic actors. There was a stronger understanding of what does it take on a local level to work on it and fund \[green space\] to make it functional and operational. This is where Exeter made a difference in terms of how the outputs and the research work were positioned, and how they can be useful to local practitioners.”* **\[5.4\]** The WHO report **\[5.3\]** and CBD COP Decisions were subsequently cited as key sources in CBD Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice Recommendation XXI/3 *Health and biodiversity* **\[5.5\]** encouraging further cross\-UN collaboration and enhancing implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\-2020 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development through linkage of biodiversity and health. Recognising the significant role of the Centre’s research in informing these global processes, in July 2019 it was designated the WHO Collaborating Centre on Natural Environments and Health. 

 **4.2 Influencing national policy** **on natural environment and health** 

 At the national scale, the Centre’s research resulted in a joint report and Departmental briefing that informed and underpinned the Government’s position on natural environment and health \(published Mar 2017\). The report was produced by a collaboration between the Centre, Defra, PHE and related stakeholders, who synthesised existing research\-based critical evidence \(including from Centre researchers\) and conducted primary research. This report and the WHO report **\[5.3\]**, were the key sources underpinning health aspects of the UK Government 25 Year Plan for the Environment **\[5.2a\]**. Consequently, Defra has established policy commitments, including the creation of national standards for Green Infrastructure and the transformation of agricultural subsidies, to a focus on public goods \(including health\), environmental investments, and large\-scale initiatives. Approximately £10m has been committed to these health and nature programmes, reaching significant populations including over 500 schools **\[5.2a, 5.2b\]**. Defra’s Social Research Advisor explains *“Defra wouldn’t be picking up on this agenda if there wasn’t some evidence underpinning it… I don’t think the evidence would be available to us in the same form if it wasn’t for your Centre... There’s a major value to society from understanding the health benefits \- health costs and benefits are absolutely huge. So, if we can get a better handle on the health costs and benefits linked to the environment, then that’s part of a much broader agenda that Defra has realised it should be doing more on”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 Our research\-based evidence has led to improvements in the environment and has informed public health processes at the national scale, in part through our collaboration with PHE and the Health Protection Research Unit in Environmental Change and Health. Our research findings were used to establish the basis for the value of investing in urban green spaces for population mental health in PHE guidance to local authority planners “Spatial Planning for Health” **\[5.7\]**; and in PHE guidance on accessible greenspace, leading to the prominence of health in the new Green Infrastructure standards for England associated with the 25 Year Plan **\[5.2a\]**. Our research and collaborations with Defra, PHE and the NHS have contributed to additional Government investment of >£5.5m in social prescribing \(prescription of non\-clinical therapeutic services and activities outside of the NHS, e.g. conservation volunteer groups\) **\[5.2c\]**. Together with the £10m investment to help children access the natural environment, this constitutes >£15m in UK government investment. 

 **4.3 Informing local policy and practice on natural environment and health** 

 The Centre’s research has led to a range of policy and practice improvements at local scale. Our work directly led to the creation of a commercial tool, Greenkeeper, to evaluate the multiple economic values of urban green infrastructure. Prior to our longitudinal studies **\[3.5\]**, there was no robust estimation of the magnitude of the positive impact of urban greenspace on population mental health, contributing to the under\-valuing of urban nature. This work led directly to our collaboration with Vivid Economics \(a climate and energy consultancy now part of the McKinsey group\) and Barton Willmore \(and independent Planning and Design practice\) on the Innovate UK\-funded Greenkeeper project. This involved the development and application of our studies of mental health and physical activity values **\[3.3, 3.5\]** to incorporate health\-related values into the tool. Greenkeeper has already been used for a range of purposes, including in 2020 to support a call from National Trust and Heritage Lottery Fund to press the Government for **£5.5bn green infrastructure funding** as part of a ‘green recovery’ to address inequalities in access to nature highlighted by the Covid\-19 pandemic **\[5.8\]**. 

 At the local scale, research by the Centre has been used to inform decision making and investment to promote the health and well\-being of Dorset’s population, and reduce pressure on its health and care services. Existing research and green space access mapping, carried out in collaboration with Public Health \(PH\) Dorset, underpinned the Healthy Places Strategy applied within PH Dorset’s Sustainability and Transformation Partnership and Integrated Care System. Their Head of Programmes said *“accessibility mapping has helped to inform the identification of pilot parks…for accessibility enhancement through a blended programme of community engagement and activation, and infrastructure improvements. Research from the European Centre was instrumental in…direct investment by Public Health Dorset of £77,900…to increase engagement with natural environments/greenspaces through enhancements to physical infrastructure and social engagement”* **\[5.9\]**. 

 Cornwall Council, under significant financial pressure from austerity, identified a need to recognise the health value as well as biodiversity benefits of almost 2000 parks, amenity and natural open spaces they manage. Collaborative work resulting from the ESRC\-funded Beyond Greenspace project **\[3.5\]** led to co\-produced outputs appended to the Council’s Open Space Strategy, and has supported investment in and sustainable management of public open spaces for community health benefit **\[5.10\]**. Health evidence input from the Centre contributed to a successful bid led by the Council \(with Exeter as a Knowledge Exchange partner\) to the European Structural and Investment Fund resulting in a £3.5m green space development project, delivering >35 hectares of improved urban green space quality and accessibility in Cornish towns **\[5.10\]**. 

 **In summary,** our research outputs have directly informed policy and practice at international, national and local scales, and have led to substantive collaborations embedding Exeter researchers within decision\-making. This was recognised in 2019 with the designation of the Centre as the *WHO Collaborating Centre on Natural Environments and Health*.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The City Centre of Florence has been a recognized UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1982, yet the negative impacts of concentrated mass tourism are among the biggest threats to the historic centre. Working with Florence City Authorities and UNESCO Florence, Professor Fabrizio Nevola’s extensive research into the urban, cultural and architectural history of Early Modern Italy has led to the release of a new digital product with Calvium Ltd, creative industry SME \- the *HiddenFlorence* App. The award\-winning augmented reality app, which has been downloaded 12,000 times from 40 countries was featured in the Channel 4 programme ‘Travel Man’ with 1.7 million viewers. Moreover, it enhances the **quality of experience for tourists,** **contributes to urban heritage management planning and strategy** by leading tourists to less well\-known parts of the city, and has **shaped the branding strategies** of cosmetic company, Lush’s marketing of new perfumes and the launch of its first stand\-alone Perfume Library store in Florence in 2019. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 *Hidden Florence* is a collaboration with Calvium Ltd – an industry leader in GPS and AR content development – to create a unique guide to Renaissance Florence. The app’s content is underpinned by long\-term academic research in the Early Modern social and architectural history of Italian cities, resulting in a spatial and storytelling experience that is authentic and authoritative. The underpinning research is published in various articles and monograph, *Street life in Renaissance Italy* \(Yale UP, 2020\) \( **3.1\-3.5**\). The research reveals: 

-  How urban space and the material culture of public space was experienced in the early modern period. 

-  That a focus on the everyday rather than on more obvious monuments and attractions can redefine long\-held assumptions about the Renaissance city. 

-  That contemporary models of social media practices and public space can transform our understanding of urban space in the past. 

 The public\-facing work of *HiddenFlorence* \( **3.6**\) has in turn contributed to the further development of these research themes, through additional funded research work. Recent awards \- HERA project ‘Public Renaissance’ and the Getty Foundation ‘Immersive Renaissance’ \- include app development and digital reproduction \(3D/AR\) as a core component of the research process. This second phase of work has expanded the original app through major institutional collaborations and partnerships, and deploys the format to new cities and new cultural assets around the world, including those housed within the National Gallery \(London\). *Hidden Florence 3D: San Pier Maggiore* was launched in November 2019 \(AppStore\) as an AR experience in the National Gallery, and has been taken up during the Covid19 pandemic as a way of promoting the gallery and research related to collections. 

 Nevola is a recognised authority on the architectural and urban history of Italian cities, and has published widely on the use and identity of spaces within cities, as well as the relations between commercial and residential spaces in Early Modern Italy. His current work looks at the street as a social space, the urban iconography that binds main streets into a coherent whole and the relations between public and private self\-representation, with an approach that also links the themes and issues of concern in the present to those of the past. Such an approach informs the design of the *HiddenFlorence* app. 

 Nevola has been principal investigator on a number of AHRC projects: 'Taverns, locals and street corners' considered the public use of taverns in the city, from Renaissance Italy to the present day. Prior to this, he conducted a research review of cities and urban communities in Early Modern Italy, and led the ‘Street Life network’, in which academics worked with non\-HEI partners. In more recent projects, Nevola has explored the use of mobile phone apps for different aspects of narrative and history, including ‘Writer on the Train’ \(a collaboration with author James Attlee and award\-winning app\-developers Agant\) and the *HiddenFlorence* app. Nevola was co\-director of 'Understanding Space in Renaissance Italy', funded by the Getty Foundation ‘Connecting Art Histories’ programme and run by Harvard University Villa I Tatti, Centre for the Study of the Italian Renaissance, Florence \(2014\-5\). Since 2018, he has been a co\-investigator on the VISTA AR European research project, based at the University of Exeter Business School, to develop, implement and evaluate a range of augmented reality and virtual reality experiences for a number of heritage sites in England and France. Most recently, since 2019, he leads a Getty Foundation funded project on digital art history approaches to mapping and modelling Renaissance Florence and a HERA\-funded project on public space in Renaissance cities. All this work expands and develops his interest in early modern streets and street life, which underpins this impact case study.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The *HiddenFlorence* App, published as a free app for Apple and Android, is an immersive experience blending academic research, digital media technology, and place\-based heritage tourism. The app was developed in collaboration with Calvium Ltd, and in partnership with Florence city authorities, Florence UNESCO office, and Polo Museale della Toscana and the Mus.E civic museums. As an innovation in digital place\-making, *HiddenFlorence*’s impact has been on enhancing methods for the presentation of heritage and cultural sites, improving the quality of tourism\-led learning experiences through digital technology, and contributing to urban heritage planning and strategy. 

 **Improving Tourism\-led Learning Experiences** 

 Since its first release in 2014, *HiddenFlorence* has now been downloaded around 12,000 times in over 40 countries. During the period covered by a 2017\-8 report it was used in over 7,000 unique sessions, in Florence \(2,177\) and globally \(5,001\); 81% of downloads originate from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada, whilst 45% of active user sessions originate in Australia, USA and Canada, with 38% in the UK **\[5.1\].** Since its update in July 2019, the revised app has been downloaded a further 4500 times, and the length of each engagement has increased substantially. The re\-launched app has been supported by a social media campaign, via Twitter, Instagram and Airbnb. Project partner networks have helped maximise visibility of the app through Polo Museale della Toscana, Comune di Firenze – UNESCO office, Mus.E, Museo degli Innocenti, and the National Gallery, London. As an example of user engagement a month\-long campaign with the National Gallery in August 2020 resulted in over 120,000 impressions and 15,000 views **\[5.2\].** In November 2020, it won the UK App Awards’ “Best Use of VR/AR in an app” award. 

 
In\-app feedback indicates user satisfaction at 80% positive. On GooglePlay, the app scores 4.9/5 overall; on Apple iStore, it has a five\-star rating. Comments **\[5.1\]** include: “\[The app\] adds fantastic layers of depth to the city. You feel like a detective following faded clues that only you can see” \(Phil\); “Walking around Firenze with Giovanni gives you a feeling for what it must have been like to live here centuries ago” \(Robert\). The app also featured in the 2016 Christmas Special of the popular Channel 4 *Travel Man* series with Richard Ayoade and Hollywood actress Rebel Wilson, broadcasting to an estimated audience of 1.7million **\[5.3\].** Certifying the app’s innovative blend of heritage presentation and augmented reality technology, Wilson comments: “It’s kinda like playing PokemonGo but with historical sites” **\[5.3\]** 

 **Enhancing marketing strategies for commercial entities** 

 An indication of the influence of the HiddenFlorence can also be suggested through its impact on the British cosmetics company Lush. Linked to Lush opening its first stand\-alone Perfume Library concept store in Florence in November 2019, developers based their own ‘perfumed guide to a city’ on *HiddenFlorence*: “the reinterpretation of the cityscape to deliberately include the sense of smell as part of Lush's launch of a new concept store and fragrance collection is probably not one of the predicted outcomes of your work on the app but I feel it is a very valuable one.” The guide was an app to work as a treasure hunt with Florentine locations linked to their five newly launched perfumes. Lush repeated this concept for Soho in November 2019 when they launched their perfume collection in London and is now an integrated component of their own app, Lush Labs **\[5.4\].** 

 **Contributing to Urban Heritage Site Management Strategy** 

 The locative media research that drives *HiddenFlorence* has provided transformative cultural impacts in the relationship between visitors and their cities for regional tourist authorities. The Florence UNESCO directorate approached Nevola to work on a new iteration of the app in recognition of its relevance to their “fundamental objective” to focus attention on the “decentralisation of tourism, extending the network of cross\-city itineraries to include sites with potential for ulterior development” \(The Management Plan of the Historic Centre of Florence, 19.1.16, pp 76, 81 **\[5.5\]\).** In 2019 the app was noted as an exemplar of the application of the Management Plan, highlighting its usefulness in moving footfall from overcrowded sites to less well\-known areas: “the effectiveness of these tools in redirecting the movement of the intelligent tourist, through informed storytelling and a playful approach to navigation of the city” **\[5.5\].** For Dott. Carlo Francini \(Director of Historic Centre of Florence\), *HiddenFlorence*  “has opened up completely new ways for us ... We are now looking at other ways in which we can use mobile digital technologies to open the city up to visitors and significantly extend the area … they visit in the city” \[ **5.6**\]. Meanwhile, Nevola is working with five new cities to establish a ‘Hidden Cities’ platform, and has also been approached by Venice, Bologna and Mantua. 

  

 **Impacting on Presentation of Heritage and Culture** 

 *HiddenFlorence*’s pioneering use of geo\-locative digital media and augmented reality provides a valuable tool for urban storytelling, enhancing the presence of tangible and intangible heritage, and creating cultural value \[ **5.7**\]. 

 
The digital reproduction of a 1584 map combined with Google Maps capabilities enables users to explore medieval Florence. Developers Calvium Ltd state: “the juxtaposition of an ancient map with its interactive digital form creates a powerful connection between the past and the present... we envision a long and collaborative journey across multiple cities, spanning a host of universities. Hidden Cities is about academic research and development in combination with public engagement and education.” **\[5.8\].** *HiddenFlorence*’s six trails offer the cultural heritage of the wider cityscape as a curated experience, introducing micro\-histories alongside culture, language and place\-based storytelling. Dott. Carlo Francini described this as “a wider perspective of history, heritage and culture of the city to be told to both local residents and to visiting tourists. It makes a curated museum experience of the entire city, and encourages participants to know about this social and cultural ‘alternative’ history of the city. It has changed … the digital ways that we can present these urban histories on a world stage” \[ **5.6**\]. 

 For Nicholas Terpstra, renowned expert on digital historical mapping techniques, “current trends in historical mapping are to … map what at first may seem unmappable – smells, sounds, emotions– and to make … the connections between the early\-modern experience of life in the city and the spatial and sensory profiles of that city. A particularly vivid example is the *Hidden Florence* app ... Geo\-location in the app allows users to transport themselves into the streets as they were walked and experienced by ordinary Florentines in the 15th century. Users are thus introduced to the power of neighbourhood and local ties in early modern Florence and can understand how such a small city, physically, could contain so much variety of experience and people. *Hidden Florence* shows us the neighbourhood rivalries and hierarchies that underlay the spatial organization of the city.” \[ **5.9**\] 

 Recent new developments have extended the activity of the app’s reach and engagement. *HiddenFlorence3D* \(see above\) **\],** news coverage in the UK and Italy and transformative impacts on local residents’ understanding of their neighbourhood \(as documented in a short film, also shared on social media, ‘A neighbourhood story’. As one resident noted “Thank you for doing this. Digitisation will be very important for us and especially for our grandchildren and those who will come after. Because, if there was no such research, the memory really fades very quickly”. \[ **5.10**\]. Meanwhile, a newly funded project is leading to the extension of the format and the creation of *HiddenCities* for 5 new cities in which close collaboration with local museums and their collections is part of the app design. In 2019 *HiddenFlorence* was awarded the ‘App prize’ at the Conference on Cultural Heritage and New Technologies, Vienna, a heritage\-practitioner focused conference. \[ **5.10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Rabies post\-exposure prophylaxis \(PEP\) is a vital tool for reducing rabies deaths worldwide but access to this life\-saving treatment is restricted by a lack of consensus, and thus investment, in appropriate treatment regimens. UofG research has provided epidemiological and cost\-effectiveness modelling that underpins changes to World Health Organization \(WHO\) policy on rabies PEP regimens. The WHO’s streamlined policy, together with UofG models of the impact of investment in PEP, were instrumental in the 2018 decision by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to add the rabies PEP to their 2021–2025 investment strategy, supporting access to rabies PEP across 57 developing countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 UofG is at the forefront of research to eliminate canine rabies. Its internationally recognised researchers and rabies programme have made landmark contributions to understanding rabies transmission and to the development and implementation of rabies\-control measures. In regions where rabies is still common, rabies PEP is given to people bitten by suspect dogs within 24 hrs and is essential for preventing the fatal onset of rabies. Several safe and effective regimens for PEP vaccine delivery are recommended by WHO, involving intramuscular \(IM\) or intradermal \(ID\) injection, often with multiple doses, but these regimens are inconsistently implemented and there are no clear recommendations about which to use in specific settings. In 2010, a Glasgow research team \(Hampson and Cleaveland\) developed a framework for comparing the cost\-effectiveness of a range of existing and experimental PEP vaccination regimens in urban and rural settings \[3.1\]. This study showed that PEP is a highly cost\-effective intervention in all cases, but that a universal switch from IM to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims \[3.1\]. 

 To put the ongoing need for investment in rabies control into context, UofG research led by Hampson performed a comprehensive estimation of the global burden of endemic rabies \[3.2\]. This study revised the global human rabies mortality up to 59,000 per year and highlighted the disease’s economic burden, which is mainly due to premature death \(55%\), followed by direct costs of PEP \(20%\), and lost income whilst seeking PEP \(15.5%\). In 2017, the WHO commissioned Hampson, in recognition of her earlier study \[3.1\], to lead a quantitative assessment of the benefits and costs of PEP, pre\-exposure prophylaxis \(PrEP\), and rabies immunoglobulin \(RIG\) regimens \(the ‘vaccine model’\) \[3.3\]. Using the model defined in \[3.1\] as a basis, this study modelled a range of IM and ID regimens and concluded that a one\-week, two\-site ID injection was most cost\-effective, using between 25−85% fewer vaccine vials than IM injection owing to the smaller vaccine dose needed \[3.3\]. PrEP was considered unlikely to be an efficient use of resources. The study was reviewed by the WHO IVIR\-AC \(its immunization and vaccines related implementation research advisory committee\), which evaluates evidence for policy recommendations — the first time rabies PEP had undergone this process. 

 In parallel work, Hampson and Dr Caroline Trotter \(University of Cambridge\) led the first study to consider the impact of a major investment in rabies PEP by ‘Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance’ \(Gavi\)—a public\-private global health partnership that aims to increase access to vaccines in developing countries. To support the modelling, the WHO formed the WHO Modelling Consortium, consisting of 47 members and 30 academic and government institutions in 18 countries, led by Hampson and Trotter. Hampson and Trotter developed a multidisciplinary modelling framework \(the ‘impact model’\) \[3.4\] to integrate epidemiological and economic burden data generated by the consortium to predict the impact of investment into PEP treatment across 67 Gavi\-eligible countries and to model different outcome scenarios \[3.4\]. These scenarios included the scaling up of mass dog vaccinations and limiting wasteful PEP use by undertaking integrated bite case management—an approach to assessing the rabies status of the biting dog. Of vital importance to the impact model were UoG field studies that assessed how access to PEP can be improved \[3.5, 3.6\]. One study addressed uncertainty about treatment\-seeking behaviour in Tanzania and provided empirical estimates of the risk of death following a rabid dog bite in the absence of PEP or following late or incomplete PEP \[3.5\]. This vital work provided the first demonstration that even in a very resource\-poor country, ID vaccination can be easily adopted by health workers. A second study performed in Madagascar revealed the health improvements that are possible when PEP is provided for free: 84% of rabies\-exposed people sought PEP \(90% of whom completed\), while also reducing vaccine use by 50% through use of an ID regimen \[3.6\]. 

 The impact model showed that an investment to fund rabies PEP would prevent \~489,000 deaths of the 1 million forecasted to occur across 67 developing countries between 2021−2035, and that the number of vials needed globally \(73 million\) would remain the same if the ID regimen is used \[3.4\]. The study thus supports a case for increased investment in PEP by the global community and provides a tool to address specific scenarios needed by stakeholders.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Canine rabies is an infectious viral disease that is universally fatal following the onset of clinical symptoms. Rabies transmitted from domestic dogs is responsible for over 99% of human deaths from the disease. Annually, it causes \~59,000 human deaths worldwide, 3.7 million disability\-adjusted life years \(DALYs\) and costs the global economy USD8.6 billion. Effective and timely rabies PEP is a vitally important tool for reducing rabies deaths while canine rabies remains endemic. But in Africa, it is often unavailable in the communities that need it most, while in Asia it is resourced at great cost and used wastefully to treat all dog bites. 

 UofG modelling research has delivered vital data for international policy and investment strategies. This work provided a crucial framework that supported new global policy on rabies PEP by the WHO. This policy, together with the models that predict the impacts of PEP investment, provided the basis for a decision by Gavi \( [http://www.gavi.org/](http://www.gavi.org/)\) to add rabies PEP to their global vaccine investment strategy. Gavi brings together key global stakeholders, including WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF, governments of donor and developing countries, the vaccine industry in developed and developing countries, research agencies and philanthropic organizations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which are each represented on Gavi’s executive board. 

 **Engagement with Gavi** 

 In 2013, Gavi considered investing in rabies PEP as part of their 2015−2021 vaccine investment strategy \(VIS\). In an expert consultation, to which UofG’s Prof. Hampson contributed, Gavi considered a range of factors but decided in November not to support rabies PEP. In their decision, they cited key knowledge gaps that limited the feasibility of vaccine implementation, including a lack of consensus on PEP treatment regimens \(10 different regimens were recommended and in use at the time\), uncertainty about PEP demand and treatment\-seeking behaviour, and the cost\-effectiveness of different investment scenarios \[A\]. Gavi instead elected to fund a USD2 million ‘learning agenda’, awarded to WHO, to address these gaps for their next investment decision in December 2018. 

 **Revision of WHO policy on rabies vaccines** 

 A crucial step towards Gavi investing in rabies vaccination was for WHO to develop an updated consensus position statement on rabies PEP to address discrepancies between its earlier recommendations \(2010\) and how PEP was being used in endemic regions, and to consider evidence for newly proposed regimens that could be evaluated. To facilitate this work, in 2016 the WHO established a Strategic Advisory Group of Experts \(SAGE\) working group on rabies vaccines whose role was to develop practical and feasible recommendations to prevent human rabies. Concurrently, WHO used Gavi learning agenda funding to commission Hampson and Trotter to undertake two key modelling studies—the vaccine model \[3.3\] and the impact model \[3.5\]. In April 2017, WHO convened a meeting of the WHO Modelling Consortium to develop a consensus on the modelling approach and, through SAGE, to commission a portfolio of research from across the consortium, to address Gavi’s learning agenda and to feed data to the modelling studies led by Hampson and Trotter. 

 From June 2017, Hampson and Trotter discussed the findings of the vaccine model study with SAGE during several meetings, with SAGE endorsing a final, clear position on shorter and less costly PEP regimens in October 2017 \[B\]. The WHO published their position paper in April 2018 \[C\], ahead of Gavi’s investment shortlisting in June 2018 \[C\]. The WHO 2018 position paper draws on evidence about the magnitude of the global rabies burden established by Hampson et al. in 2015 \(global burden study\) \[3.2\] and the pivotal findings from the Gavi\-funded/WHO\-commissioned PEP modelling work \[3.3\], stating: “ *ID administration of rabies vaccines provides a cost\-saving and dose\-sparing alternative to IM vaccination. ID PEP regimens use at least 25% less vaccine vials than IM PEP regimens. As numbers of patients seen in clinics increase, ID regimens become increasingly cost\-effective, using up to 85% less vaccine vials”* \[C\]. A summary document published by the chair of SAGE explicitly sets out the updates to WHO’s position on vaccine regimens, stating that, “ *WHO now also recommends newer, shorter vaccine regimens that reduce costs, quantity of vaccine, and number of clinic visits…*” citing the UofG research \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\] throughout as background to changes \[B\]. 

 **Gavi invest in rabies PEP in their 2021–2025 investment strategy** 

 Drawing on the IVIR\-AC validated PEP regimens, the impact modelling study \[3.4\] was able to offer key insights into the health impact \(future deaths averted\), costs and value for money of various scenarios of investment in these PEP regimens, both with and without additional rabies control programmes. Hampson & Trotter shared these findings iteratively and responsively with Gavi to address the board’s questions \[D\]. In November 2018, Gavi announced the addition of rabies PEP to their 2021−2025 investment strategy \[E\]. The Gavi board’s documentation cited as strategic rationale for the investment case: 1\) the WHO recommendations on the choice of regimen \(2\-site, 1\-week ID regimen\); and, 2\) the UofG\-Cambridge modelling projections, citing Hampson and Trotter \[D, F\]. The Head of Policy at Gavi said, “ *The estimates that Dr Hampson and Trotter used formed the basis of our projections on future demand for and impact of rabies PEP. This was a critical foundation for determining financial implications for Gavi, the relative cost\-effectiveness of rabies PEP and other important criteria to support the Board’s ultimate decision to approve the investment case*… *The synthesis of research contributed by UofG researchers helped to simplify what had been a complicated investment proposition—contextualising the global burden and identifying a universal and simple strategy*” \[D\]. 

 Rabies PEP is for the first time one of Gavi’s strategic goals, opening an investment window across the 57 countries eligible to apply for Gavi vaccine support for the next five years, which could prevent an estimated 489,000 deaths from rabies. 

 **Emerging secondary impacts on national vaccination policies** 

 Despite significant disruption to international discourse in 2020 ahead of the Gavi investment window, and in response to the WHO position on rabies PEP, several countries have changed, or are in the process of updating, their rabies PEP policies to bring them into line with WHO recommendations. Currently the Philippines, Nepal and Bhutan have revised guidelines; Bangladesh, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar and Cambodia are in the process of revising \[G\]. In India, Pakistan and Tanzania implementation has been more regional. In India the state of Himachal Pradesh  [issued new guidelines](http://www.nrhmhp.gov.in/sites/default/files/files/Approved%20%20HP-IDRV%2017-6-2019%20%20Rabies%20Guidelines.pdf) in response to the WHO position statement \[H\]. UofG researchers led by Hampson have also supported a switch to the 1\-week ID regimen in the 28 districts of South Eastern Tanzania and in the Mara region in North West Tanzania.

 Starting in 2015, Milroy’s Hands On Art Workshops \( **HOAWs**\) have been delivered for school\-aged children in Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya \( **KRC**\) with support from Vodafone Foundation \( **VF**\) and the UN Refugee Agency \( **UNHCR**\). HOAWs are now established as year\-round programmes, supported by a UNHCR\-sponsored Hands On Coach \(for a secondary school graduate\) to deliver art workshops paid for by the Hands On Gateway Bursary. Also in place now are Hands On Art Workshops Scholarships, providing secondary school tuition for a primary school graduate associated with the HOAWs programme. In February 2020 artwork from KRC students was presented in “Hands On”, an exhibition curated by Milroy at Elephant West, London \(150 people on opening night\). During the COVID\-19 pandemic \(2020\) Milroy liaised with UNHCR Kakuma to provide workshops for students via mobile phone messaging. In total, 10,250 students and 150 teachers in KRC have benefitted from the HOAW programme, through which the VF and UNHCR have introduced visual art into their Instant Network Schools partnership programme, and UNHCR Kakuma engaged in their first delivery of a visual art programme.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Milroy’s artistic practice focuses on still life painting. Her research explores the cultural, collective and personal significance of everyday objects, investigating questions of identity and representation, and thematic subjects of time, presence and absence, and memory. Milroy is fascinated by the nature of painting and, in tandem with her focus on a human relation to objects, she investigates the experiential processes of painting, with attention to its histories and practices. These twin critical concerns of the genre of still life and the nature of painting have underpinned Milroy’s practice for four decades. 

 Milroy argues that the genre of still life painting is not just defined as the depiction of objects, but that it operates more as a ‘mind\-set’ for the artist and viewer to explore. In this, still life could include paintings that might initially be understood as landscapes or portraits. In her approach to still life, Milroy focuses on particular conditions related to ‘making’ and ‘looking’, which both artist and viewer engage in when producing or viewing a painting. For Milroy, painting is characterised by a duality embracing both action – the activity or movement of mind and body in responding to the world – and forms of contemplation allied to a sense of mental and physical stillness. Looking at still life painting can engender a heightened awareness of materiality, of touch and transformation, affecting one’s sense of everyday things in the world, as well as evoking memories related to objects and collections of things. Through her take on still life, Milroy also explores the poetics of ‘the everyday’. Through her conceptual approach to still life, Milroy has expanded the stylistic scope of the genre to include performance and audience\-interactive paintings, installation and site\-specific paintings, and 3\-D paintings alongside more traditional canvas and panel\-based works. 

 Milroy’s critical process was notably explored in her solo exhibition *Here & There: Paintings by Lisa Milroy* at Parasol unit foundation for contemporary art London, UK in 2018 \( **R1**\), which brought together a selection of Milroy’s paintings from the past 15 years. Motifs of clothing and shoes were foregrounded: object categories prominent in her work since the 1980s. On the ground floor, the exhibition focused on ‘Here’ and included paintings that addressed materiality and bodily presence through pattern and colour, 3\-D object\-paintings and audience\-interactive paintings. Two works, *Up & Down, 2016* and *Off the Rails \(Ahmedabad\), 2016*, invited physical interaction from viewers, while other paintings such as *Garment, 2017* and *FormLess, 2016* pictured items of clothing in various states of formation. The installation painting *Party of One, 2013* included a performance, repeated throughout the duration of the exhibition. On the first floor, the exhibition focused on ‘There’, presenting a selection of monochromatic paintings that explored absence in relation to loss, time and memory. Also featured was the monumental twenty\-two metre\-wide painting *Black and White, 2004 – 2005,* based on imagery of the artist’s studio and acting as Milroy’s manifesto, embodying her view of the interplay between art, painting and life; and *Shoes, 1985,* on loan from Tate and a touchstone painting for Milroy. 

 Milroy’s other recent solo exhibitions, *Handmade – Paintings by Lisa Milroy* at One Off Contemporary Art Gallery Nairobi, Kenya in 2018 \( **R2**\), and *Cloth,* Mansur Farm, The Retreat, Ahmedabad, India in 2016, \( **R3**\) further demonstrate her research into looking and touch, transformation, and questions of identity and representation. Recurrent motifs, for example, are clothing and shoes. Both exhibitions included installation\-based, audience\-interactive works \- editions from the *Off the Rails* series \(from 2016 and 2018\), \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\) and *Espadrilles, 2017* \( **R2**\). These interactive works demonstrate Milroy’s innovative approach to still life painting, presenting compositions of elements that visitors are invited to alter, rehang and change according to their inclination and taste. They solicit reflection on how the everyday activities of ‘choosing’ may contribute to the construction of identity and sense of self as well as foster aesthetic sensibility. Milroy also reveals how the act of looking can be a form of creative work, necessary for imaginatively engaging with artworks. Milroy’s research presented in **R1**, **R2** and **R3** demonstrates a powerfully phenomenological approach to her engagement with still life, where action and contemplation are both a methodology and thematic subject. 

 Milroy’s research investigating the human relation to objects and the nature of painting informs and underpins the pedagogy of the practical art workshops that she has devised over the years, such as *“Everyday Objects: a drawing workshop”,* for delivery to art students, artists and arts professionals and the general public, and more recently for the HOAW project.

 The significance of Milroy’s research can be demonstrated by the number of her paintings held in many national and international museum and gallery collections, including Tate, UK, Metropolitan Museum of Art, USA, Kunstmuseum Bonn, Germany, Frac Occitanie Montpellier, France and Fukuoka Art Museum, Japan. Her work is cited in numerous publications on contemporary art and still life, and is included in the UK GCSE curriculum as a case study for secondary school students studying art. Elected to the Royal Academy of Arts in 2005, Milroy was Artist Trustee at Tate from 2013 \- 2017 and Liaison Trustee to the National Gallery in 2015 \- 2017.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Milroy’s research has introduced and embedded an approach to visual art education through provision of practical art workshops stemming from her artistic practice and research within primary and secondary schools in Kakuma Refugee Camp \( **KRC**\), Kenya, through her creation and delivery of the ongoing Hands On Art Workshops \( **HOAW**\) initiative with support from Vodafone Foundation \( **VF**\) and the UN Refugee Agency \( **UNHCR**\). Between 2015 and 2019, Milroy’s HOAWs have been delivered to KRC via 8 formal video conference workshops; Skype sessions; and 3 in\-person mission visits. Now established as year\-round programme, HOAWs encompass: 

-  2 primary and secondary school art clubs \( **A**\); 

-  UNHCR\-sponsored employment of a Hands On Coach to deliver art workshops via the Hands On Gateway Bursary, providing one\-year salary for a secondary school graduate and tuition for a developmental programme of the recipient’s choice; 

-  Hands On Art Workshops Scholarship, providing secondary school tuition for a primary school graduate associated with the Hands On Art Workshops programme. 

 KRC \(established 1992\) is currently home to 196,000 refugees of 21 nationalities, including 75,000 school\-aged children, 42 primary and 7 secondary schools. Prior to Milroy’s workshops, KRC school children did not encounter visual art programmes through the school curriculum. Since Milroy’s initial engagement in KRC, HOAW has, as the UNHCR Education Officer confirms, ‘indirectly and directly benefitted 10,250 students and 150 teachers’, via 8 video conferencing workshops, and 3 trips to KRC, across 4 schools and the Community Centre \( **B**\). 

 In November 2015, VF invited Milroy to deliver *“Everyday Objects: A Drawing Workshop”* \(informed by **R1**, **R2**\) via Instant Network Schools \( **INS**\) video conferencing to 20 students in Dadaab Refugee Camp, Kenya. INS, an educational partnership between VF and UNHCR, gives young refugees, host communities and teachers access to digital learning content and the internet to improve the quality of education. Based on the success of this pilot workshop, VF invited Milroy to devise a programme of art workshops for primary and secondary school\-aged students in KRC, Kenya, working with UNHCR Kakuma. Reflecting her still life painting practice \( **R1**, **R2**\), Milroy centred the workshops on the themes of time, place and identity. In 2016 HOAW became an independent project within the INS programme, supported by UNHCR Kakuma. 

 **Establishing a new precedent for visual art education for primary and secondary school\-aged children in Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya \(KRC\):** 

 HOAW is the first visual art programme to have been delivered in partnership with UNHCR Kakuma in KRC, with support from VF. Through participation in HOAW, students in KRC have progressed in their artistic abilities, confidence, and articulacy: ‘from the tentative coal creations of the first video conferencing session where there were very few comments or questions among the student cohort, Lisa has helped the class develop into a passionate, vocal, energetic and highly skilled group’ \( **C**. former Head of Brand, Marketing & Events, Vodafone Foundation\).  Pupils \(from a 2016 HOAW\) attested that participation ‘give\(s\) me faith to believe that I can make it’ and ‘make me feel connected with nature’ \( **A**\); and that they enjoyed ‘drawing real objects’ \(of the type reflected in Milroy’s practice as seen in paintings such as *Shoes, 2017* \( **R1**\) and *Dress, 2018* \( **R2**\)\). When asked which objects they brought to draw and what it represented, pupils’ answers included: ‘I brought a shoe – shoe represents for me what I wear at school. It protects me from thorns and hot stones’; the ‘model of a dove – I love birds so much and there are a lot of them in Kakuma’; and ‘a model of a radio – I love radio because this is the means of getting information in rural areas’ \( **A**\). HOAW developed skills students identified as valuable to their futures: ‘It makes me happy’; ‘The art really means a lot to me. This is because it makes me work hard in order to achieve my goals and talent’ \( **A**\). 

 A selection of paintings and drawings created by HOAW students in KRC was presented in an exhibition curated by Milroy, “Hands On” from 6\-15th February 2020 at Elephant West, the freely accessible public cultural centre in West London run by Colart, the large international supplier of art materials. Colart’s Global Communications Manager confirms that the opening night attracted 150 people, ‘mainly consisting of new visitors’ including ‘due to the nature of the artworks on display \[...\] several art teachers and students from local schools. It represented a vital educational purpose within the local community’ \( **D**\). 

 **Promoting the sustainability of visual art education in KRC through the creation of art\-clubs, independent learning resources, and employment of artists to enable a year\-round programme:** 

 In 2016, in response to students’ enthusiasm for art\-related activities through HOAW, UNHCR Kakuma set up a week\-long Art Boot Camp \(led by Lodwar\-based artist Fatuma Abdul and subsequently Michael Adeer, professional artist living in KRC\), which grew into a regular event delivered during the academic breaks in KRC. In 2017, under Milroy’s guidance, HOAW students at 2 primary schools in KRC \(Angelina Jolie Primary School and Morneau Shepell Secondary School\) formed their own Art Clubs, initially naming them the “Golden Stars” and “Blue Sky Divers”. To facilitate independent art practice and encourage local ownership of the programme, Milroy devised the ever\-evolving ‘Hands On Self\-Directed Art Workshops’ manual, again stemming from her practice. Formatted on A4\-size paper, the manual has been shared via email and can be printed locally. It is offered to students, teachers and professional artists in KRC to facilitate HOAW, where the workshops may be tailored and the manual added to, to reflect and engage individual perspectives. 

 In 2018, Milroy addressed the lack of provision of art materials to support programme delivery in KRC schools, securing corporate sponsorship from Colart, who donated art materials with a retail value of GBP15,000 and the GBP4,000 cost of freighting them to Kenya, in recognition of ‘the unique programme Milroy had developed \( **D**\). UNHCR Kakuma administer the donation, providing designated INS schools in KRC with a store of art materials to support HOAW all year\-round. In summer 2020, Milroy set up the Hands On Gateway Bursary. In September 2020, the first recipient began her employment as Hands on Coach in KRC under the direction of UNHCR Kakuma. Drawing upon new workshop guidelines provided by Milroy as well as her own experience as a former secondary school student of HOAW, she delivered twice\-weekly art workshop sessions, open to all in a community hub during the Covid\-19 pandemic, where ‘approximately 30 participants per day’ attended \( **B**\). Milroy generates funds for the annual Hands On Art Workshops Scholarship and Hands On Gateway Bursary through her artistic practice, and both Scholarship and Bursary are administered by Windle International Kenya. 

 **Informing organisational approaches to visual art programmes by partnering with global bodies \(UNHCR\); charitable partners \(Vodafone Foundation\), and corporate sponsors \(Colart\).** 

 HOAW has assisted UNHCR in attaining key strategic goals. As the former UNHCR Senior Protection Coordinator attests: ‘The Hands On project aligns with UNHCR strategy to provide refugees with opportunity for artistic and talent development, as well as create connection, sense of community and overcome trauma and distress. Students and teachers have expressed their joy to be provided with a platform to break learning monotony and engage in the beauty of artistic expression’ \( **E**\). The 2018 UNHCR report *Turn the Tide: Refugee Education in Crisis*, which highlighted the need for strong partnership to break down the barriers to education for 7,400,000 refugee children under UNHCR’s mandate, called their Instant Network Schools programme a ‘bridge to the world’ and specifically cited HOAW as an example of how technology can improve the learning opportunities available to refugees \(p. 46; **F**\). In the report, UNHCR recognised the significance of ‘teaming up with technology’ and singled out Milroy as one of the ‘global leaders’ delivering video conferencing workshops in partnership with the VF. HOAW has also contributed to the organisational capacity of schools in Kakuma to deliver visual art education and thereby increased progress towards UN Sustainable Development Goal \(SDG\) 4: ‘Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all’, alongside benefiting the local professional artist community. In its encouragement and support of female students at Angelina Jolie Primary School and Morneau Shepell Secondary School, HOAW contributed towards the achievement of UN SGD 4, target 4.5: ‘By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education and vocational training for the vulnerable, including \[…\] children in vulnerable situations.’ 

 Colart’s donation of GBP15,000 of discontinued products assisted Colart in achieving their sustainability goals and KPIs. Their 2025 strategy aims to ‘remove, reduce, reuse and recycle throughout our production and supply chains’ and ‘engage with local communities’. HOAW was profiled prominently in their 2019 Sustainability Report \( **G**\). For VF, HOAW ‘acted as a catalyst \[...\] to consider how technology and connectivity can open up opportunities for learning and creativity for young people growing up in the confines of refugee camps’, and brought visual arts into the scope of their programme, which had previously ‘focussed on creating access to traditional education and STEM subjects’ \( **C**\). It ‘inspired employees, challenging typical perceptions of what our tech and network can provide’ \( **C**\) and led to a new collaboration with Milroy to mark the United Nations’ International Day of Education on 24th January 2020: the world’s first ‘live\-streamed school trip for refugees’ in which pupils in KRC visited the National Gallery using VR headsets and tablets. Milroy hosted the tour, exploring a selection of 9 paintings on the theme of ‘time’ \(a thematic focus of Milroy’s research as well\). The event attracted international media coverage, with the Director of Collections and Research at the National Gallery, commenting: ‘To think of children in Kenya, and all over the world being inspired by art here is truly wonderful,’ \(in **H**, ‘Young refugees in Kenya take a VR school trip to London's National Gallery’, CNN 24/01/2020\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Horizon 2020 RESIN project, building on a 20\-year programme of research at the University of Manchester, has improved planning and decision\-making for climate change adaptation and resilience across Greater Manchester and Europe. 

1.  Our research has advanced the development and implementation of the *Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020\-2025* and the *Climate Change and Low Emission Strategies: Whole Place Implementation Plan* *for Greater Manchester \(2016\-2020\)*, by giving adaptation and resilience strategy greater prominence on the policy agendas of Manchester Climate Change Agency and the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. 

1.  Our online spatial decision support portal, the European Climate Risk Typology, has provided a practical tool for policymakers, advancing their understanding of climate risk and shaping policy development. The portal has: supported the European Investment Bank in the development of its climate risk model; improved the European Environment Agency’s understanding and communication of climate risk; and informed the adaptation and resilience agenda advanced by the European Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Susceptibility to adverse impacts stemming from climate change varies significantly in form and extent between urban areas, depending on their location, socio\-economic circumstances, and biophysical characteristics \[1,2\]. University of Manchester \(UoM\) research has demonstrated the need to differentiate cities according to their vulnerability to extreme weather and climate change hazards \(e.g. floods and heat waves\), so that effective, city and region specific responses can be developed \[1,2\]. There is also a need for collaboration between cities and regions with similar climate risk profiles, to share experiences and learning \[2\]. These goals can be supported via the development of climate risk typologies \[1,2\]. 

 The Climate Resilient Cities and Infrastructures \(RESIN\) project brought together 17 partners from eight countries. Beginning in 2015, RESIN’s primary focus was to produce knowledge, tools and methodologies to support urban areas in becoming better adapted and more resilient to climate change. RESIN applied a risk\-based framework for understanding climate change impacts and developing adaptation responses to reduce those impacts \[3,4\]. Three key outputs from the UoM RESIN research are: 

 **Output 1\) The European Climate Risk Typology** \[4,5\]. Developed collaboratively by UoM with the input of RESIN project partners and end\-users, the Typology is an interactive online portal to visualise, compare and analyse climate risk across European cities and regions \(Figure 1\). The Typology helps users to understand and assess climate change risks in their area. It also helps them to identify other European cities and regions with comparable climate risk characteristics, in order to develop links and share experience. 

 **Output 2\) An online portal for new spatial datasets.** The data underpinning the Typology is freely available via an online portal \[5\]. These new spatial datasets, covering all of Europe, are organised around the four climate risk themes of hazard, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity \[3\]. This data can support climate change adaptation and resilience strategy in cities and regions across Europe by enhancing the development of evidence bases to help decision\-makers identify their most pressing climate risks and thereby develop strategy accordingly. 

 **Output 3\) An extended evidence base for Greater Manchester.** Alongside the Typology and data portal, our research has generated new datasets that identify climate change risks to critical infrastructure, and flood risk to transport infrastructure, in Greater Manchester \[6\]. These datasets have informed and supported the development and implementation of climate change adaptation and resilience strategies in Greater Manchester.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our research has positively impacted on urban climate change adaptation and resilience planning in Greater Manchester and at the European level by strengthening knowledge and providing practical tools used by policymakers to inform climate risk modelling and support the development and implementation of climate change strategies and frameworks. 

###  a\) Strengthening Greater Manchester climate adaptation and resilience strategies and frameworks 

 UoM researchers collaborated with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\) and the Manchester Climate Change Agency to co\-produce knowledge of local climate risks and support the development and implementation of climate change adaptation and resilience strategies and frameworks. The European Climate Risk Typology, launched in October 2018 \(Output 1, \[5\]\), and our extended evidence base for Greater Manchester \(Output 3, \[6\]\) were used to develop and implement local climate change adaptation and resilience strategies. 

 The *Climate Change and Low Emission Strategies: Whole Place Implementation Plan for Greater Manchester \(2016\-2020\)* \[A\] is Greater Manchester’s overarching climate change strategy \[B\]. As noted by GMCA’s Assistant Director of Environment, “ *Completion of the RESIN project itself represents the delivery of one of the first actions of the implementation plan. RESIN project outputs \(including the European Climate Risk Typology and reports on climate risks to critical infrastructure\) have acted as an overarching resource to inform and support the delivery of subsequent actions listed in the strategy. For example, a RESIN project report allowed us to identify the key risks to Greater Manchester’s transport infrastructure posed by increased incidence of flooding, as part of our transport strategy and planning*” \[B\]. Collaboration between GMCA and the UoM RESIN project has also helped to establish Greater Manchester as one of four pilot areas to develop new approaches to the protection and enhancement of the natural environment, as part of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 25\-year environment plan. RESIN research outputs have subsequently enabled Greater Manchester to advance its Urban Pioneer programme, which assesses new tools and methods for managing the natural environment \[B,C\]. 

 The *Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020\-2025* \[D\] was developed by the Manchester Climate Change Partnership. Comprising 60 members across ten sectors, the Partnership used RESIN research outputs to set Manchester’s adaptation and resilience priorities and objectives. Citing RESIN research on climate change risks to critical infrastructure, the Framework states \(p. 20\): “ *Floods and storms account for the highest risks, and these events stand out as priorities for adaptation and resilience planning and action*” \[D\]. The Framework also makes direct reference \(p. 21\) to the use of the RESIN European Climate Risk Typology to progress Manchester’s adaptation and resilience objectives and “ *… identify and then learn from cities and urban areas that have a similar climate risk profile as Manchester*” \[D\]. 

 Summarising the impact of the RESIN project on the development of climate change adaptation and resilience in Manchester, the Programme Director of the Manchester Climate Change Agency noted that “ *The RESIN project has made a valuable contribution to the evidence base on topics linked to climate change adaptation and resilience in Manchester and has developed tools to help drive forward progress. In doing so, the RESIN project has helped the City of Manchester to establish a formal policy commitment to address the challenges associated with the changing climate*” \[E\]. 

###  b\) Impact on European institutions working to strengthen urban climate change adaptation and resilience knowledge and planning 

 As a result of direct engagement with European agencies, the reach and impact of the RESIN project extends across Europe. Drawing on Google analytics data \(which understates the totality of traffic to the website\), the European Climate Risk Typology website \(http://european\-crt.org/index.html\) was accessed during 1663 sessions \(occasions where a user interacted with the website\) by users from 87 countries, between February 2019 and October 2020 \[F\]. \(Capture of Google data analytics on use of the typology website only began in February 2019, following its release in October 2018.\) The Typology and associated datasets \(Outputs 1 and 2, \[4,5\]\) have directly supported European institutions working to strengthen urban climate change adaptation, and to improve the information they provide to cities and regions. 

 The European Investment Bank \(EIB\) is the lending arm of the European Union, the largest multilateral financial institution in the world and one of the largest providers of climate finance \[G\]. EIB has developed a climate risk model to assess the climate risk of its counterparties. The model provides transparency regarding the EIB’s exposure to climate risk, and enables it to meet the disclosure requirements of the European Central Bank \[G\]. The RESIN European Climate Risk Typology data *“…provided valuable support to the development of the prototype of the EIB Climate Risk model” by delivering an “assessment of the physical risks arising from climate change at the level of European regions*” \[G\]. EIB benefited from the Typology data which is “… *provided in a consistent, well\-structured and easily accessible way. Without the European Climate Risk Typology data, more time would have been needed to access and aggregate data on physical climate risk at the level of European regions*” \[G\]. 

 The European Environment Agency \(EEA\) is an agency of the European Union, whose task is to provide 32 member countries and six cooperating countries with robust information on the environment. The EEA used the Typology to inform their European Climate Adaptation Platform, Climate\-ADAPT, an online resource which helps users to access and share data and information \[H\]. Climate\-ADAPT incorporates an ‘Urban Adaptation Map Viewer’ which collates information to provide data on climate risk, using data from the UoM Resin Typology \[H\]. “ *The Typology has helped us to highlight the complex nature of climate risk at the European scale, and also to emphasise the importance of the exchange of experiences and learning between cities that share similar climate risk profiles*” \[H,I\]. EEA has drawn on the Typology to inform their recent report, *Urban adaptation in Europe: how cities and towns respond to climate change* \[I\]. This report notes that the Typology “… *emphasises that all of Europe’s cities and NUTS 3 regions* \[areas of 150000\-800000 inhabitants\] *are at risk from climate change, albeit for different reasons*” \[I\]. The EEA has undertaken additional work, drawing on the Typology, to classify cities according to their size, climate change vulnerability and risk characteristics \[H\], concluding that “ *The Typology is a useful strategic decision\-aid that supports more efficient and effective approaches to assessing and adapting to climate risks in European cities and regions*” \[H\]. 

 The Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy brings together over 10,000 local and regional authorities across 59 countries voluntarily committed to implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. Climate change risk and vulnerability assessments \(RVAs\) are required from all Covenant of Mayors signatories, and “… *the Covenant of Mayors recommends the use of the European Climate Risk Typology to signatories in order to support their climate change adaptation work*” and to develop their RVA \[J\].  As the Typology helps users to identify other regions with similar risk profiles, “ *this can help Covenant of Mayors signatories and their coordinators to find cities and regions that share their underlying climate risk characteristics, and to obtain and share knowledge with them and possibly develop exchange networks*” \[J\]. 

 The data underpinning the European Climate Risk Typology is of real value in light of the difficulties in accessing locally relevant climate risk data to inform climate change adaptation and resilience planning. Users can access a wide range of indicators in this database, covering different elements of climate risk, including new data produced within the RESIN project and data that was previously difficult for potential end users to access \(Output 2 \[5\]\). The Covenant of Mayors acknowledges this: “ *As data on climate change hazards, vulnerabilities and risks are not always readily available to European cities and regions*”, the Covenant of Mayors recommends the Typology as “ *a useful resource for aiding Covenant of Mayors signatories in meeting their commitments*” \[J\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Public bodies, such as health boards or government departments, must reliably interpret evidence to properly inform their decision\-making. Illari and Clarke’s work explores the diverse types of evidence obtained from biological and social mechanisms and systems, and how these are used for multiple **purposes**. This has impacted on **1\) international** **methodologies for evidence assessment in health** by increasing the **plurality** of evidence they use, particularly **evidence of mechanisms** \(NICE, IARC\), and on **2\) UK ethical frameworks for AI and data science** by improving their evidence use, particularly their attention to anticipating and monitoring how systems including populations **react** to new ethics frameworks \(Cabinet Office, DCMS, West Midlands Police, the NHS\). The beneficiaries are patients who need high quality medical advice both in England and Wales and internationally, and all people in the UK affected by government and NHS data projects such as the UK Cabinet Office Framework for Data Ethics and the NHS Code of conduct for data\-driven health and care technology.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Phyllis Illari’s research has focused on causality, mechanism, and information quality in clinical contexts and the policymaking sphere, arguing in each of these areas that sound approaches to evidence and methods need plural, diverse forms of evidence for multiple *purposes.* For example, the clinic serves a diverse range of purposes, and clinicians benefit from a variety of types of evidence tailored for those different purposes. Policymakers, likewise, require different kinds of evidence to inform their interventions, depending on what policy goal they are pursuing. Hence evidence cannot be graded and ranked in abstraction from those purposes. 

 Illari argues that information quality is fitness for *purpose* \( **\[R1\]**, particularly Illari’s sole\-authored chapter\), and hence that information quality is purpose\-specific rather than global. Illari’s co\-authored book with Russo **\[R2\]** argues for a *pluralist* approach to causality: multiple approaches to causality should be accepted, because they are each useful for different purposes. Illari’s co\-edited book on mechanisms **\[R3\]**, shows how the idea of mechanisms can and should extend far beyond biological mechanisms such as DNA replication to include also social mechanisms such as stigmatisation; Illari’s co\-authored chapter with Glennan **\[R3\]** examines the varieties of mechanisms. 

 Illari collaborated with Brendan Clarke as Co\-Is on the AHRC\-funded ‘Evaluating Evidence in Medicine’ \(EBM\+\) project \( **\[i\],** PI Williamson, University of Kent, 2015\-2018\). This project studied diverse ways of getting evidence of mechanism, such as of how diseases progress in the body, or how drugs act on targets to stop or inhibit disease progression. The project studied how evidence of the entities and activities of such mechanisms, and their organisation, is gained and used, and created the EBM\+ network of researchers interested in these problems. 

 The core of Clarke and Illari’s joint work \(in two books **\[R3, R4\]**, and several papers including **\[R5, R6\]**\) is in what they are arguing *against*. Clarke and Illari oppose a dominant trend in public agencies’ official use of evidence, which prioritises a restricted range of evidence methods, so\-called ‘gold standard’ evidence such as randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\). Instead, they argue that one single ‘best’ form of evidence cannot address the *plurality* of purposes for which evidence is used. Such purposes range from, for example, identifying subpopulations of patients who have different treatment risks, to deciding whether it is justifiable to use a surrogate outcome \(an outcome that is easier to measure than the real target outcome\) in a randomised clinical trial. This focus on purpose and context of use makes even characterising good evidence difficult, but one key finding is that proper *evidence of mechanism* \(of disease causation, mechanisms of actions of drugs, and social mechanisms of health policy\) is needed. 

 Clarke and Illari’s work **\[R4\]** meets this challenge by providing detailed guidance on evaluating evidence of mechanism alongside the already universally used RCT evidence. It also raises a central problem for mechanisms in the context of policy: reactivity—the fact that when mechanisms and systems are acted on, they change. Illari first writes about changing experimental systems as a central scientific problem in **\[R2\]**. Understanding this is vital to any use of evidence of mechanism and of system by policy bodies, because policy decisions \(including publishing evidence assessment guides or data ethics frameworks\) are actions that the system being governed *reacts* to. After Clarke and Illari’s joint work, public bodies should use diverse evidence of mechanism or evidence of system to make good policy decisions, but they also need to take account of the fact that any policy decision they make will change that system.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 There is strong public pressure for agencies to make transparent and publicly justifiable decisions about complex questions such as when the identification of potential cancer hazards should trigger a public health response, which rapidly\-emerging technologies and treatments to fund, and how to regulate AI and data driven technologies. The idea that a single, narrow, ‘gold standard’ of evidence is available, and can help public decision\-making is tempting, but illusory **\[R2, R4**, **R6\].** Clarke and Illari worked alongside practitioners and policy\-makers to impact evidence assessment methods in healthcare, and ethics frameworks for data science and AI in public bodies. Their research **\[R4**, **R6\]** increased the **plurality** of evidence taken into account in formal evidence assessment methods in healthcare, including or improving attention to **evidence of mechanism**, increasing the fitness of evidence for multiple **purposes** **\[R1\]**. It also **\[R3**, **R1\]** illuminated where knowledge is crucial, particularly when systems, including populations, **react** to new AI and data science ethics frameworks **\[R2\].** 

 **1\) Shaping international methodologies for evidence assessment in health** 

 From 2015\-18, as part of the ‘Evaluating Evidence in Medicine’ \(EBM\+\) **\[i\]** project team at UCL and Kent, Clarke and Illari worked with stakeholders from the International Agency for Research on Cancer \(IARC\) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). Beth Shaw, senior technical adviser in the Centre for Guidelines, Michael Kelly, retired Director of Public Health, NICE, and Kurt Straif, Head of the Section of Evidence Synthesis and Classification, IARC, were associate members of the project. This team developed a methodology to show how formal evidence assessment frameworks can take account of evidence of mechanism for multiple purposes. Project members then sat on formal consultations with IARC and NICE on their methodologies for evidence assessment, and submitted written material to them recommending inclusion of evidence of mechanism. This led to both organisations changing their methods to reflect the project findings; as Kelly explains “changes to the methods officially adopted by these extremely influential health agencies are very significant and have global reach” **\[A\]**. These are illustrated below: 

 *IARC*: IARC is the specialized cancer research agency of the World Health Organization \(WHO\), responsible for assessing all carcinogenic hazards. IARC’s *Preamble to the Monographs* is the methodology manual governing how these assessments are performed, and as IARC’s Head of the Section of Evidence Synthesis and Classification explained “WHO and National health agencies use this information as scientific support for their actions to prevent exposure to potential carcinogens” **\[B.1\]**. Before consulting with EBM\+, IARC included mechanistic evidence in the *Preamble*, but it was tentative and secondary to other evidence; by 2017 they confirmed: “the EBM\+ programme has already led us to think in new ways about the nature and kinds of evidence of carcinogenicity and to scrutinize our own approach” **\[B.1\].** This was reflected in the update to the 2006 *Preamble* which was published in 2019 and is likely to be used for many years **\[B.2\]**. The project PI represented the project on the international Advisory Group recommending revisions to the *Preamble*, which “led to significant changes in the way mechanistic evidence is evaluated in the new *Preamble*, with mechanistic evidence now treated on a par with epidemiological studies on humans and with animal studies. Mechanistic evidence thus plays a much more substantial role in the new *Preamble* than in previous versions of the *Preamble*.” **\[B.3\]** This improves treatment of **evidence of mechanism**, and **plurality** of evidence used. The *Preamble* explicitly refers to **\[R4\]**, including its systematic review methods for evidence of mechanism. It now includes much more information about kinds of mechanistic evidence that might be relevant and how to get it. There are many more extended treatments through the second half of the *Preamble*, and attention to grading of overall mechanistic evidence in **\[B.2\],** section 6c, reflecting **\[R4\]**. This contribution is deeply and internationally significant: as the *Preamble* puts it, “Cancer prevention is needed as much today as it was when IARC was established, because the global burden of cancer is high and continues to increase” **\[B.2\]**, p1. By changing IARC’s methodology to improve treatment of evidence of mechanism and plurality of evidence, Illari and Clarke have thus contributed to robust and responsible public decision\-making in the assessment of cancer risk and prevention. 

 *NICE*: NICE improves outcomes for all people using the NHS, by providing assessments of the value for money of new technologies and medicines proposed for adoption in the NHS, and evidence\-based guidance for clinicians. NICE’s *Methods Manual* **\[C.1\]** is, as Kelly puts it: “core to what it does and how it does it”, **\[A\]** and is used in all assessments of evidence NICE runs for medical treatments in England and Wales. NICE “is a leading health agency internationally, with many European countries simply adopting NICE guidelines, and NICE influencing pharmaceutical companies”, **\[A\]** and it is copied across the world because, “It is internationally recognized for its independence and methodological rigour” **\[C.2\]**. Illari and Clarke’s research **\[R2, R4, R6\]** changed the methodology recommended by NICE in the methods manual. To change these methods is to shape social policy interventions, domestically through NICE’s role in evidence assessment, and internationally through the wider impact of NICE’s methods of appraisal. 

 In 2017, NICE’s Senior Technical Advisor stated that “the work of the EBM\+ group is helping us to explore the question around the value and use of different types of evidence \(including the use of evidence of mechanisms\), from a multi\-disciplinary perspective, in order to make practice recommendations that are robust and justifiable” **\[C.3\]**. After further consultation by the project team **\[i\]**, evidence of **pluralistic** types, particularly **evidence of mechanism \[R2**, **R4**, **R6\]**, were explicitly recognised in the 2018 manual **\[C.4\],** and remain in the 2020 version **\[C.1\]**. As Kelly writes, Clarke and Illari “worked particularly intensively” on the evidence assessment tables in section 4 \[of **R.4**\] which “connect\[ed\] their theoretical work to evidence assessment processes, particularly those used at NICE” **\[R4\]**. Kelly explains that “These showed how to incorporate better assessment of evidence of mechanism into existing evidence assessment processes, particularly focusing on the justification of intervention methods and surrogate outcomes used” **\[A\]**. The manual has changed to include “explicit recognition of the importance of combining statistical evidence and evidence of mechanisms” **\[C.2\]**. It now recognises key purposes **\[R1\]** for which evidence of mechanism is required, including for identifying relevantly different sub\-populations and for assessing potential interventions or risks. The former recognises that people do not always react in the same way to a treatment, necessitating assessment of whether trial evidence gained in one population will apply to a different group or a sub\-group \( **\[C.1\]**, p26\) while the latter has led to explicit recognition in the manual of causal mechanisms linking factors to outcomes, and “mechanism of action” of potential treatments as two of nine recommended review questions \( **\[C.1\]**, p58\). Mechanism as important to understanding how the medical intervention being assessed works now appears in four other places \( **\[C.1\]**, p62, p63, p72, p113\). Finally, there is implicit recognition of evidence of mechanism as important in justifying use of a surrogate outcome in trials in two places \( **C.5** **Appendix A**, 2020, p7\), with reference to evidence of process, and of intermediate outcomes. As Kelly puts it, “The work of the project increased the presence of evidence of mechanism in the manual from very close to zero, thereby increasing the variety of evidence taken into account, and explicitly acknowledging the importance of evidence of mechanism for particular purposes”. These research\-led changes to IARC and NICE methodologies reach an extremely broad population globally: “it includes anyone exposed to a carcinogen, or treated with a pharmaceutical intervention or other treatment, or subject \[to\] a public health improvement” **\[A\]**. 

 **2\) Influencing UK ethical frameworks for AI and data science** 

 *Cabinet Office and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\):* In 2014, due to the expertise demonstrated in **\[R1\],** Illari was invited onto a months\-long consultation by the Cabinet Office on the first major ethical framework for government data science. As the co\-chair of the Committee writes: “Illari’s expertise in information and evidence, *and* in causality and causal inference, is almost unique” \[ **D**\]. This consultation created the 2016 Cabinet Office Framework for Data Ethics **\[E.1\],** which applied to all government data projects. It was the precursor of the framework still in force with DCMS \(2020\) **\[E.2\]**. Using attention to purpose **\[R1\]**, Illari was “responsible for Point F” **\[D\]**, presenting **reactivity** **\[R2\]** as one of 11 key checks that frame the whole document \( **\[E.1\]**, p5, elaborated p12, remaining in force now \( **\[E.2\],** p14\). Illari also fed into Point D on data quality **\[R1\]**, \( **\[E.1\]**, p5; \( **\[E.2\],** p27\). The co\-Chair of the Committee explains that “this work probably prevented significant problems in government data science and public sector data projects are supposed to apply this framework to guide their data projects” **\[D\]**. 

 Following this, Illari was appointed from Sept 2016\-20 as a founder member of the Data Ethics Group \(DEG\) of the Alan Turing Institute, which is the UK’s flagship Institute for Data Science and AI. The DEG has been consulted by many significant UK public bodies, so that, with the DEG’s interdisciplinary team, Illari has improved attention to **plural evidence** and **reactivity** in national approaches to data ethics. This included informal consultations with DCMS on setting up the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, with the Information Commissioner’s Office, and with Police frameworks on predictive policing. Illari as part of the DEG particularly pressed for serious consultations with stakeholders from minoritized groups, and for the need for all projects to monitor for ongoing evidence of impact on them. 

 In one particularly important case in 2019, NHS England consulted the DEG on a Code of Conduct for data\-driven health and care technology ethics **\[F.1\]**. As the resulting DEG report put it, “The Code is intended to form the basis for the NHS’s long\-term strategy of developing, procuring and deploying data\-driven tools.” **\[F.2\]** Illari and her UCL colleague Melanie Smallman argued that the Code’s focus on individual providers or technologies provided no protection against system\-level harms \( **reactivity** of a system to a policy intervention\) that NHS England had a duty to prevent. Instead, there needed to be thorough and sustained attention to “wider social implications of data\-driven and AI technologies on health” **\[F.2\].** Instead of the consultation on the Code of Conduct closing, as planned, they were successful in maintaining a consultative status following the 2019 launch. As the Chair of the DEG explains, “The civil servants involved are to be commended in taking seriously Illari and Smallman’s representations, as DEG members, that NHSX had a duty to understand and monitor the potential collective effects of the use of technologies which, even if individually ethically reasonable, might collectively create serious harms, especially for vulnerable groups.” **\[D\]** Given current COVID\-19 circumstances this work is not complete. The Chair notes that “the Cabinet Office, and NHSX, wish to keep a high standard – and *demonstrate* that they are keeping to a high standard – so that public confidence in government and the NHS can be maintained. Illari played an important role in advancing this in these consultations” **\[D\]**. Furthermore, “She has helped to establish robust practices in public bodies that are more sensitive to evidence, taking into account reactivity, that have raised the quality of data projects in the UK and prevented harm” **\[D\]**. 

 The significance of this contribution extends beyond even all UK government data science and the NHS use of data\-driven tools. These have been crucial years for data ethics and good work is rapidly copied. For example, recent documents on such strategies for the Scottish Government cite links to the Turing Institute work. Illari’s focus on **pluralistic evidence** of what the system is doing and how we *continue* to know this as it changes is vitally important. Both here and in medical methodology this research has wide\-ranging and long\-lasting impact in encouraging and enabling robust and responsible public decision\-making.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 120/100 words\) 

 Upper limb disability due to neurological or musculoskeletal disease affects millions of people in the UK and worldwide. Physical therapy is beneficial, but requires high\-intensity, repetitive training. Conventional physical therapy involves direct interactions between therapist and patient, which limits its delivery. To overcome this and reduce costs for upper limb physical therapy, Imperial Researchers invented ‘GripAble<sup>TM</sup>’, a low\-cost portable device that enables *self\-directed* arm movement training. The Imperial College researchers commercialised it in 2018 as GripAble, Ltd., xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  It is now the most widely adopted technology in the UK upper limb therapy market.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Arm and hand weakness after stroke should be treated with repetitive task training.  However, conventional delivery in 1:1 sessions between patients and physical therapists limits the intensity with which this can be done.  Robotic tools enabling self\-directed therapy have long held promise to supplement arm training and reduce the need for continuous, direct interactions between physical therapists and patients, but previous arm rehabilitation robots were cumbersome and costly, limiting their practical application. 

 Addressing this, research at Imperial College showed that small robotic devices able to promote functional hand interactions with real objects provide effective rehabilitation both for the hand and the entire arm \(1\). The Imperial team also showed that arm weakness after stroke arises not only as a consequence of brain injury affecting motor pathways, but also from damage to cognitive networks, which can be trained using grip\-control software games \(2\). 

 Combining these insights, the researchers developed a small, simple, mobile device \(‘GripAble<sup>TM</sup>’\), which “gamifies” physical therapy exercises for improving functional arm and hand movements. Product design was optimised over several years using a patient\-centred “double\-diamond” process in collaboration with medical device designers from the Helen Hamlyn Centre, Royal College of Art. This involved hundreds of patients with varying arm\-disabilities testing multiple iterations of hardware and software prototypes, in order to maximise the range of patients that could benefit from the innovation. 

  

 The device is innovative. It has a unique patented sensor mechanism \(paired cantilevers\) that enables highly\-sensitive and robust force measurement, whilst also mimicking the flexibility of everyday objects. This flexible sensor design improves comfort, motivation and motor performance compared to standard rigid sensors \(3\). The device has also been tailored to the needs of physical therapists and allows for a range of exercises and remote assessments of both upper \(shoulder/elbow\) and lower \(hand/wrist\) arm. 

 Clinical studies have investigated accessibility and usability of GripAble<sup>TM</sup> in real world scenarios. GripAble<sup>TM</sup> was able to be used by 93% of unselected stroke patients with arm weakness \(4\). This makes it the most highly accessible technology for self\-directed training in natural cohorts of stroke survivors with arm weakness. 

 Exercise intensity is one of the strongest modifiable factors determining physical recovery after stroke and providing the device to stroke inpatients \(plus a single training session\) increases the total time they perform arm exercises 2\-fold, and exercise repetition counts 10\-fold, compared to standard care \(5\). This  study is the first clinical trial to show that a self\-directed arm rehabilitation technology increases exercise intensity among *unselected* stroke patients, including those with severe arm disability and co\-existing cognitive impairment, relative to standard care. 

 Gripable<sup>TM</sup> also has been employed in research studies investigating optimal exercise training schedules for motor learning in stroke and in people with cerebral palsy.  Motivation and performance gains using Gripable<sup>TM</sup> were shown to improve further through collaborative exercises between abled and disabled people relative to training alone \(6\). This discovery was the basis for a £1,100,000 NIHR award which is developing the world’s first “Online Social Physiotherapy Network”, which is enabling directly interactive arm exercises between remotely located patients with each other or with healthy volunteers using either Gripable<sup>TM</sup> or standard mobile phones/tablets.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Functional impairments of arm and hand movement comprise the commonest stroke related disabilities, affecting 75% of the 100,000 new stroke cases each year in the UK. Guidance from the Royal College of Physicians in 2016 and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) in 2013 recommended that arm weakness after stroke should be treated with repetitive task training, outcomes of which are dependent on frequency and repetition. However, the amount of upper limb therapy provided on the NHS is markedly less than what is known to be effective because of inadequate provision of therapists delivering services \[ **A**\]. Although UK NICE guidelines recommend at least 45 minutes of therapy per day for meaningful improvements after a stroke, the 2019\-20 UK national stroke audit showed that actual inpatient therapy is an average 25 minutes per day, which decreases still further when patients were discharged \[ **B**\]. 

 Conventional physical rehabilitation requires 1:1 interactions between a physical therapist and patient and therefore is expensive to deliver and limited by staff time. Service provision could be improved for better patient outcomes using technologies enabling patient\-directed rehabilitation.  This is not a new idea, but previous rehabilitation technologies were not widely adopted because of unit costs, complexity, and special site requirements. To address these challenges, researchers at Imperial College developed ‘GripAble<sup>TM</sup>’, a low\-cost, accessible, mobile patient\-directed upper limb rehabilitation device. GripAble<sup>TM</sup> was designed to enable a broad range of patients with arm disability to engage in self\-directed arm training without the need for professional supervision, including those with severe weakness and cognitive impairment.  It can be used by patients in their homes, as well as in hospitals, with the option that home performance can be monitored by physical therapists or doctors logging in remotely. 

 GripAble<sup>TM</sup> \[ **C**\] prototypes were used by therapists at Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust and Imperial Private Healthcare to supplement standard upper rehabitation exercises for stroke and other neurological causes of arm weakness from early 2019. By 2020, the system was being offered to all patients with arm weakness as part of standard of care therapy;  10\-20 new patients per month have been using the protocol system for part or the entirety of their hospital stay and, in selected cases, for up to several months post\-discharge. 

 In the same year, Imperial College researchers founded Gripable Ltd to manufacture, distribute and further develop the system. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 

 Gripable Ltd. launched its first Gripable<sup>TM</sup> product line in Summer 2020. By the end of 2020, Gripable<sup>TM</sup> was deployed to neurological and rehabilitation centres across 17 countries; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx including the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability, North\-West London, and Aldebourne Rehabilitation Centres, King’s College Hospital, St Georges NHS Trusts,  Cereneo \(Switzerland\) \[ **D**\], Hobbs \[ **E**\], BMI, HCA, and 12 Centres in the USA, India, Canada, Singapore, S Korea, Japan, UAE, and Qatar. Measured in terms of units in use, Gripable<sup>TM</sup> became the most adopted technology in the UK for upper limb rehabilitation by the end of 2020. It also is the only rehabilitation system shown to allow patients continued use in the transition from hospital\-based rehabilitation to home and fully self\-directed rehabitation \[ **C**\]. 

 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx This demonstrates that as barriers to conventional physiotherapy increased and the number of supervised rehabilitation sessions dramatically decreased, GripAble<sup>TM</sup> enabled patients to continue their essential rehabilitation exercises at home supervised remotely by their therapists using the patient’s online performance records. 

 While thus far GripAble<sup>TM</sup> has predominantly benefited stroke patients, it is now increasingly used in the treatment of a wider range of conditions. GripAble<sup>TM</sup>’s digital register currently includes xxxx patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, sporting injuries or complex hand surgery \[ **C**\]. Furthermore, at Great Ormond Street and the PACE Centre children with cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental disorders are now using GripAble as part of their treatment. 

 The availability of GripAble<sup>TM</sup> has added to options for upper limb physical rehabilitation endorsed by the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Neurology \[ **F**\].  The President of the Association, Prof. Jane Burridge wrote: 

 *“\[GripAble\] fulfils a need for higher intensity, home\-based, self\-administered rehabilitation that cannot be practically met by increasing therapist numbers given NHS resource constraints… ACPIN fully support the translation of GripAble into routine clinical use and have actively supported dissemination of the evidence and information about the device.”* 

 GripAble<sup>TM</sup> also has had an impact on therapies recommended by other national rehabilitation information sites such as the UK’s leading online disability lifestyle magazine \(AbleMagazine\) **\[G**\]. Use by Key Opinion Leaders and Rehabilitation Centres was highlighted by a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Care \[ **H**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 High levels of second\-hand smoke \(SHS\) in Scotland’s prisons placed the health of staff and people in custody at risk. From 2015, UofG researchers have partnered with the Scottish Prison Service \(SPS\) to support delivery of an evidence\-based smoking ban, implemented across all 15 Scottish prisons on 30 November 2018 \(approximately 4,000 staff and 8,200 people in custody\). SHS levels were reduced by 80% immediately after the ban, and by 91% at 6 months. Concentrations of SHS in Scottish prisons are now similar to those in most smoke\-free environments. Health economic analyses found the policy highly cost\-effective in both the short\-term and long\-term. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Smoking has been prohibited by law in enclosed public spaces throughout Scotland since March 2006, to protect non\-smokers from SHS. The effect of these smoke\-free laws on health was the subject of a  [REF2014](https://ref2014impact.azurewebsites.net/casestudies2/refservice.svc/GetCaseStudyPDF/32321) impact case study \( **Pell**\). Nonetheless, some locations were exempt from this legislation, including Scotland’s 15 prisons. In 2013, the Scottish Government published its  [Tobacco Control Strategy](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2013/03/tobacco-control-strategy-creating-tobacco-free-generation/documents/creating-tobacco-free-generation-tobacco-control-strategy-scotland/creating-tobacco-free-generation-tobacco-control-strategy-scotland/govscot%3Adocument/00417331.pdf), which outlined the ambition to create a tobacco\-free generation of Scots by 2034. To mitigate the health risks posed to staff and people in custody from exposure to SHS, the Tobacco Control Strategy stated a commitment to “ *work in partnership with the Scottish Prison Service and local NHS Boards to have plans in place by 2015 that set out how indoor smoke\-free prison facilities will be delivered*.” A ban on smoking in prisons was highlighted as a key step towards creating a smoke\-free Scotland. 

 **UofG partners with SPS to support development of a smoking cessation policy for Scottish prisons** 

 In March 2015, SPS announced it would lead a Scotland\-wide Tobacco Strategy Workstream to develop a joint action plan related to smoking in prisons. Previous prison\-based research by UofG had established links with the SPS Head of Health and Wellbeing, including a shared interest in prisoner smoking and health. In April 2015, **Hunt** and **Sweeting** presented early plans for the Tobacco in Prisons \(TIPs\) study \(outlined below\) at an SPS Tobacco Strategy Workstream meeting. Subsequently, they were commissioned to conduct a literature review on prison smoking and smoking bans to inform SPS decisions on how best to move towards the introduction of a smoke\-free prisons policy in Scotland \[3.1\]. 

 **The TIPs study: an evidence\-based approach to the Scottish prisons smoking ban** 

 TIPs was developed in 2015–2016 as a three\-phase, multi\-method study exploring the periods before announcement of a Scottish smoke\-free prisons policy \(Phase 1\); during preparation for implementation of this policy \(Phase 2\); and after implementation of this policy \(Phase 3\). Its aim was to evaluate the process and impacts of implementing enhanced tobacco control in Scottish prisons. TIPs was funded by the National Institute for Health Research \(grant PHR 15/55/44\), with **Hunt** as Principal Investigator. TIPs Co\-Investigators included other UofG researchers \( **Sweeting**, **Pell**, **Demou**, **Leyland**, **Craig**, **Boyd**\), with researchers from the University of Stirling and the University of Aberdeen. **Hunt** and **Brown** moved to the University of Stirling in March 2018; however, **Hunt** holds an Honorary Chair at UofG and remained Principal Investigator for TIPs. Phases 2 and 3 of TIPs involved a joint collaborative programme between UofG and the University of Stirling, with researchers from each institution leading workstreams \(see section 4\). 

 TIPs Phase 1 was conducted during September 2016–July 2017. This phase included a survey that confirmed high prevalence of smoking among people in custody in Scotland \( [74%](http://www.sphsu.mrc.ac.uk/university-files/reports/TIPs/Prisoner%20Feedback%20Summary.pdf)\); by contrast, the 2016 Scottish Health Survey recorded a 21% smoking rate within the community. **Hunt**, **Sweeting**, **Demou** and **Logan** led a multiple\-method approach to characterise SHS exposures in all Scottish prisons, with Co\-Investigator Dr Sean Semple \(Respiratory Health Team, University of Aberdeen; now at University of Stirling\). This novel research produced the largest dataset of SHS measures from any prison service worldwide \[3.2\], including measurement of fine particulate matter, airborne nicotine and biological markers of exposure. It provided evidence of SHS exposure in cells, landings, halls and other communal areas across all Scottish prisons, showing variations by time of day. Overall, the findings suggested that exposure to SHS for prison staff was likely to be similar to that of a non\-smoker living with a smoker, although large between\-prison variation was observed. Measurements taken during daily activities showed that some common tasks performed by staff \(e.g. cell checks and maintenance\) were likely to lead to high occupational SHS exposures, similar to those experienced in bars before the 2006 Scottish smoke\-free laws \[3.2\]. 

 Attitudes and opinions of staff and people in custody were also evaluated in all Scottish prisons ahead of SPS announcing the new policy to ban smoking, through focus groups and surveys conducted by UofG researchers. This research suggested that most staff \(but a lower proportion of people in custody\) felt positive about a smoking ban, while recognising potential major operational difficulties. It also suggested that support for the policy might be strengthened if staff had access to objective measures of SHS exposure \( **Sweeting**, **Demou**, **Brown**, **Hunt**\) \[3.3\]. Factors felt to be critical for successful implementation of a prison smoking ban included effective and timely communication, as well as enhanced training and support, before launching the policy \( **Brown**, **Sweeting**, **Logan**, **Demou**, **Hunt**\) \[3.4\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Tobacco is the world’s leading cause of avoidable ill health and premature death, with 27% of UK cancer deaths and 22% of all deaths in 2010 attributable to smoking. High levels of smoking and SHS exposure contribute to health inequalities among prison staff and people in custody for jurisdictions without a smoke\-free prisons policy. To address this issue, the Scottish Government included cessation of smoking in its prisons as part of the ambition to create a tobacco\-free generation of Scots by 2034. UofG research conducted in partnership with SPS and other key stakeholders was critical in terms of: **\(1\)** demonstrating high levels of SHS risk in 2016; **\(2\)** supporting planning and implementation of a service\-wide smoke\-free policy for Scottish prisons; and **\(3\)** demonstrating its effectiveness by confirming substantially reduced SHS concentrations after policy implementation in 2018. 

 **Shaping the Scottish prisons smoking cessation policy \(March 2015–July 2017\)** 

 From 2015 onwards, **Hunt** and **Sweeting** regularly met with SPS \(including people in senior positions in SPS headquarters and union leaders representing prison staff\), as well as people working in smoking cessation services and tobacco control in NHS Health Scotland and the Scottish Government, to discuss how UofG research could inform, and evaluate, the policy\-making process. Their literature review \[3.1\] provided key evidence to support an SPS strategy paper, which was submitted to the Scottish Government in February 2016 \[5.A\]. This document recommended a comprehensive smoke\-free policy for Scottish prisons as “ *the most effective option to address the negative health impacts associated with exposure to SHS to those in custody and those working in or visiting prisons*.” The Cabinet Secretary for Justice accepted the SPS recommendations and requested further advice on timescales to embed a culture of smoking cessation. In September 2016, activities and timelines for development and implementation of the smoke\-free policy were outlined to the Governors and Deputy Governors of Scottish prisons \[5.A\], citing the UofG literature review \[3.1\]. 

 High baseline measures of SHS levels recorded in 2016 in residential areas across all 15 Scottish prisons \(TIPs Phase 1\) \[3.2\] highlighted the severity of the issue, and were shared with the SPS Tobacco Strategy Workstream group ahead of publication \[5.A\]. These SHS exposure data \[3.2\] supported the decision taken by SPS that all prisons in Scotland should become smoke free in November 2018. This service\-wide smoking ban was announced by the SPS Chief Executive at a joint press conference with **Hunt** in July 2017, on the day the SHS data were first published online \[3.2\]. The accompanying press release highlighted that the move to smoke\-free prisons had been informed by TIPs \[5.B\]. The Chief Executive of SPS described the UofG findings as *“a call to action. It is not acceptable that those in our care and those who work in our prisons should be exposed to second hand smoke*” \[5.B\]. Announcement of the Scottish prisons smoking ban attracted considerable media interest \[5.B\]. 

 The SPS lead for smoke\-free policy implementation described the SHS results as “ *an absolute game changer .. finding out that very broadly speaking .. working in a residential area of a prison was like living with a smoker. It was shocking and unacceptable, .. so that effectively moved things”* \[5.C\]. A representative of the Scottish Government said “ *What TIPs brought us was the catalyst .. without TIPs I think we probably still wouldn’t have smoke\-free prisons .. and the transition certainly would not have been as smooth. It gave us some credible evidence which was very persuasive politically for the decision makers, but also for the people who’d have to implement it. So, the timing for implementation became suddenly very accelerated .. without TIPs that wouldn’t have happened .. in terms of the focus of TIPs and the quality of TIPs it was absolutely perfect”* \[5.C\]. 

 **Preparation for implementation of the smoke\-free policy \(July 2017–November 2018\)** 

 Following announcement of the smoking ban in July 2017 \[5.B\], **Hunt, Brown** and **Sweeting** joined colleagues from SPS, NHS Scotland, University of Stirling and the Scottish Government as members of the SPS Smoke\-Free Prisons Stakeholder Advisory Group \(SAG\). Research updates were a standard agenda item at these monthly meetings. A lead on public health and tobacco control in Health Scotland said “ *I can’t think of a better example of where there has been a piece of research and then a policy change as a result of it. \[TIPs\] has a great study design .. it had both the numbers which had come from the exposure data, then also had the story of what that means in terms of the perspective of the staff, .. the narrative was so strong and that’s why I think it had this huge impact”* \[5.C\]. 

 The TIPs Phase 1 survey found that  [53%](http://www.sphsu.mrc.ac.uk/university-files/reports/TIPs/Prisoner%20Feedback%20Summary.pdf) of people in custody who were current smokers wanted to quit. UofG researchers also identified key factors likely to influence the successful implementation of the smoking cessation policy \[3.3, 3.4\]. TIPs Phase 2 aimed to determine whether smoking behaviours, attitudes and cultures changed ahead of the ban; for example, would smoking rates reduce as people in custody attempted to become non\-smokers before being required to quit or abstain. UofG \( **Sweeting**\) led surveys of staff and people in custody among all Scottish prisons \(May 2018–July 2018\). Furthermore, in\-depth interviews with people in custody, prison staff and smoking cessation staff in six case study prisons were conducted initially by UofG \( **Hunt**, **Brown**; November 2017–February 2018\) and by University of Stirling thereafter \(March 2018–November 2018\). Survey and interview findings were regularly communicated to SPS via meetings, presentations and summaries during the pre\-ban period. Measures adopted by SPS to facilitate smoking cessation before the ban included extensive communication and diversionary activity programmes to promote the smoke\-free policy. 

 A Scottish Government representative involved in the SAG meetings said “ *I think the Phase 2 \[of TIPs\] was as important as the Phase 1. The Phase 1 gets us to an evidence base for making decisions. The Phase 2 is much more focussed on how the actual policy change would be made .. it’s one of the rare brilliant times where you can see the research smoothing the way for the policy”* \[5.C\]. The SPS lead for the smoke\-free prison implementation said *“The fact that you guys were doing some very informed and robust focus groups and questionnaires allowed us to check whether our message was getting home. So having you as part of our SAG meetings was really important. And you feeding back on some of the research .. was really helpful for us”* \[5.C\]. A lead on public health and tobacco control in Health Scotland described TIPs as *“a great example of how Health Scotland and third sector and then academia can work together”* \[5.C\]. The SPS Head of Health and Safety who helped to facilitate the collection of the SHS data praised the way that prison staff were brought on board through the research process, and the positive impact of the research process on continuing professional development \[5.C\]: “ *It’s been fantastic that we’ve went through the stages \[of the research\] and provided \[staff and the Unions\] a baseline \[SHS exposure\] to what it is now, through a proper process that they understand .. how it was monitored and measured .. that’s all in all perfect for me… it’s been a benefit, a massive benefit, to transfer information to the people on the shop floor*” \[5.C\]. 

 The smoke\-free policy, informed by UofG research, came into force in all 15 Scottish prisons on 30 November 2018, an event widely covered by the media \[5.D\]. In addition to affecting approximately 8,200 people in custody, the smoking ban ended the inequity of over 4,000 prison staff experiencing occupational exposure to SHS, a situation that had been illegal in almost all other Scottish workplaces since 2006. The journey taken by one Scottish prison \(HMP Kilmarnock\) to implement the policy was outlined in a video commissioned to mark the first year of being smoke free \[5.D\]. 

 **Evaluation of the smoke\-free policy \(December 2018–present\)** 

 Implementation of the smoking ban in November 2018 fulfilled the Scottish Government’s commitment to achieve smoke\-free prison facilities by 2034. TIPs Phase 3 was designed to evaluate the outcomes of this policy, including post\-ban SHS levels and cost effectiveness. 

 Air quality monitoring data collected during the first days following implementation of the smoking ban demonstrated an immediate impact of this policy \(Semple, Hunt, with **Sweeting**\) \[5.E\]. Exposure to SHS was reduced by approximately 80% when compared with measurements from 2016, providing evidence for high levels of compliance with the smoking ban as soon as it was introduced. This early success was highlighted by the media \[5.E\]. Data collected in all prisons at 6 months after implementation of the smoking ban demonstrated further reductions in SHS exposure \( **Demou**, **Sweeting**, with Hunt, Semple\) \[5.E\]. Fixed\-site measurements in residential halls demonstrated that SHS levels were 91% lower than those in 2016, with measurements taken during staff activities showing decreases for previously high\-exposure tasks \(e.g. unlocking cell doors\). SHS exposures among people in custody and prison staff are now similar to those found in most smoke\-free environments. The majority of prison staff also reported no longer being exposed to SHS at work \[5.E\]. The SPS Head of Health and Safety described the post\-implementation reduction in SHS as “ *absolutely magnificent,”* praising the outcome and the process, which made it *“a safer place for prisoners in terms of health and for staff.”* \[5.C\]. 

 Health economic analyses pointed to the clear cost\-effectiveness of the smoke\-free policy \[5.F\]. Long\-term analyses showed total costs were lower with the smoke\-free policy compared to without it for both people in custody \(GBP32,848 versus GBP33,749\) and prison staff \(GBP10,462 versus GBP11,183\). Quality\-adjusted life years were higher in the smoke\-free comparator for both groups, suggesting that prison staff and people in custody benefit from an increase in quality of life with a smoke\-free policy. At the GBP20,000 willingness\-to\-pay threshold set by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the smoke\-free policy for both groups would be considered highly cost\-effective compared to not having the smoke\-free policy. 

 **A model for implementation in other countries** 

 The Scottish smoke\-free prisons policy was the first service\-wide implementation founded on a comprehensive multifaceted evidence base, and so offers a clear model for other countries to follow. The Scottish ban was highlighted for World No Tobacco Day in May 2019, an event led by the World Health Organization to promote effective policies for reducing tobacco consumption. During October–November 2019, the Northern Ireland Prison Service \(NIPS\) held a consultation on its intention to make all prisons nationwide smoke\-free. NIPS highlighted that this change in policy was “ *informed by the success of the implementation of smoke free prisons in the Scottish Prison Service*” \[5.G\], with the TIPs investigators invited to contribute to the consultation process.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In response to the 2006 Cooksey Review of UK health funding, nationwide networks of applied health research centres were piloted from 2008 to 2013. These centres, called CLAHRCs \(Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research & Care\), were funded by the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) and designed to improve healthcare by more effectively translating clinical research into practice. Professor Graeme Currie was Director for CLAHRC Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire until December 2010, after which he moved to Warwick Business School \(WBS\). 

 Drawing on research which analysed the pilot phase, Prof. Currie of WBS, with colleagues from Nottingham, developed a new implementation model, founded on organisation science research that was adopted by the West Midlands during the second phase of CLAHRCs. This research led to Prof. Currie’s appointment as Deputy Director of the CLAHRC West Midlands, which ran from 2014 to 2019, supported by a GBP9,000,000 investment from the NIHR. During this period, Prof. Currie and colleagues at WBS applied and refined the implementation model, which improved knowledge brokering, distributed leadership towards the middle of the organisation and strengthened human resource management. The application of the model within CLAHRC West Midlands has resulted in evidence\-based change in frontline NHS services, leading to benefits for staff and patients in maternity, musculoskeletal disease, mental health and cancer services in the region \- and in Australia and India, where the model has also been adopted.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Billions are spent on generating research evidence to explore what clinical interventions work to address long\-term health conditions, in terms of effectiveness, cost efficiency, and patient experience. However, such research evidence is slow to trickle into frontline service delivery. 

 CLAHRCs were introduced by the NIHR, which was established in response to a new research and development strategy in the NHS: Best Research for Best Health. They were designed to address the “second gap in translation” identified by the Cooksey Review of 2006; namely, the need to improve healthcare in the UK by accelerating the translation of clinical research evidence into practice. 9 CLAHRCs, each encompassing a university in partnership with local NHS bodies, were funded and piloted over the period 2008 \- 2013. WBS research has involved the application of theoretical perspectives from organisation science alongside empirical studies of the creation, translation and use of knowledge and innovation. From 2010, this expertise was applied to the CLAHRC initiatives and became a focus of new research, including: 

 2011 to 2014: Professors Lockett and Currie, and colleagues from WBS, were funded by NIHR to conduct intensive research studies, examining pilot CLAHRCs in the UK. The research was carried out over two overlapping time phases to capture changes in the new CLAHRCs over time. The project underpinned a published report, which provided an independent and theory\-based evaluation of CLAHRCs. The findings highlighted that translation of clinical research evidence into practice was supported by knowledge brokering and distributed leadership, and that human resource management interventions in the realm of recruitment and selection, training, performance management and job design shaped this **\(3.1\)**. 

 2011 to 2012: As Director of one of the pilot CLAHRCs \(Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire\), Prof. Currie had implemented a model for translation of clinical research evidence into practice, which, following his move to WBS, he evaluated with colleagues from the University of Nottingham 2011 \- 2012 **\(3.2\)**. This research demonstrated that barriers to implementation of evidence\-based innovation can be overcome if knowledge is coproduced by academic and clinical service staff, taking account of the organisational context in which it is to be applied. This approach was founded on organisational science theory. 

 In 2013: 13 new regional CLAHRCs were competitively awarded for the period 2014 \- 2019, including CLAHRC West Midlands, an ambitious initiative designed to build capacity for implementing evidence\-based innovation across academia, the health service, and among public and patients in the West Midlands, and to enhance the capacity of these sectors to interact with the other. Based on WBS’s previous research and expertise in this area, Prof. Currie was appointed Deputy Director of the CLAHRC West Midlands, and led a WBS\-based research team working at the centre of the CLAHRC throughout the 2014 \- 2019 phase. Drawing on the findings of the earlier research into “what works” for effective knowledge transfer of evidence\-based innovation in complex health settings, the team undertook a comprehensive programme of applied research. This programme, conducted under a cross\-cutting *Implementation and Organisational Studies* theme within the CLAHRC, delivered state\-of\-the\-art management expertise for the implementation of evidence\-based innovation across four clinical service themes, relating to maternity and child health, youth mental health, disease prevention and chronic disease. 

 Research conducted by the WBS team within CLAHRC West Midlands: 

1.  Identified what healthcare providers should do to ensure receptive context for evidence\-based innovation, including in Australia and India **\(3.1, 3.2, 3.3\)**, specifically how best to mobilise knowledge **\(3.2, 3.3, 3.4\)**. 

1.  Identified how leadership should be distributed across healthcare providers to support implementation and scale up of evidence\-based innovation, including in India and Australia **\(3.5, 3.6\)**. 

1.  Identified what human resource policies and practices healthcare providers should implement to best engage their clinical workforce in implementing and scaling up evidence\-based innovation **\(3.7\)**. 

1.  Identified how middle managers represent crucial conduits in scaling up evidence\-based healthcare **\(3.8\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The pilot NIHR CLAHRC West Midlands \(WM, then termed ‘Birmingham and Black Country’\) was based on a clinical\-academic tradition which focused on the production of high\-quality academic publications, assuming frontline managers and clinicians would adopt guidance and evidence published in academic journals intuitively. This had limited impact upon frontline practice and clinical outcomes. Contrasting with this, during the 2014 \- 2019 CLAHRC WM, Prof. Currie and the WBS research team worked alongside hospital practitioners and clinical academics to ensure evidence\-based innovation was embedded in frontline practice more effectively, using approaches to implementation derived from their organisation science focused research \(e.g. **3.1\-2**\). Director of the CLAHRC WM, Richard Lilford, confirms that the research centre adopted the implementation model developed by Prof. Currie, stating, “ *As a cross\-cutting theme, the implementation model of coproduction and knowledge brokerage was embedded within our clinical themes/health care settings. This has been an extremely effective implementation model to deliver service change and improvements in both managerial and clinical outcomes; for example, in maternity services \(BSOTS triage intervention with Birmingham Women’s Hospital\)\) and musculoskeletal disease \(StartBack intervention for lower back pain across Staffordshire*\)” **\(5.1\)**. 

 Senior Manager for CLARHC WM from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Paul Bird, further attests to the impact of this approach, stating, “ *There is no doubt that the team from Warwick Business School provided lessons from their research that caused a major restructuring of the CLAHRC in the West Midlands towards a model of translational health research that encompassed knowledge brokering in our system to draw down and use evidence for service improvement*…We see the results in a step change in services ranging from maternity triage, to lower back pain interventions, to early intervention in youth mental health, right across healthcare providers in the West Midlands, with significant patient benefit"" **\(5.2\)**. 

 Benefits arising from the 2014 \- 2019 CLAHRC WM included: 

 **The scale up of an evidence\-based intervention in maternity units:** Women are traditionally seen in the order in which they arrive at a maternity unit, if experiencing problems prior to, or after, birth. This differs to an accident and emergency unit where patients are triaged by clinical priority. Prof. Currie’s research team supported implementation of a maternity triage system \(BSOTS\) by providing lessons focused upon clinical engagement, midwifery leadership and strategies to adapt the intervention for different maternity units **\(3.1\-5\)**. Lead Clinician Sara Kenyon testified that: “Work from the qualitative research elements helped the BSOTS team develop new knowledge about how the BSOTS tool had been implemented in different maternity units, in preparation for national and international roll out” **\(5.3\)**. Following the WBS implementation support, the evidence\-based triage system has been introduced in 14 maternity units, with another 27 in progress with “54% of women seen within 15 minutes \(compared to 39% before\). This means the service is safer"" **\(5.4\)**. 

 **The scale up of an evidence\-based intervention in musculoskeletal services:** Research **\(3.4\)**, coproduced with primary care clinicians, exemplifies the effective application of the knowledge brokerage implementation model proposed by earlier research **\(3.2\)** to support the scale up of a new non\-surgical service model called ‘STarT Back’ – Stratified care for low back pain. Krysia Dziedzic, Director of the Impact Accelerator Unit, Keele University, confirmed that “ *this new model results in greater health benefits, achieved at a lower average health\-care cost, with an average saving to health services of GBP34.39 per patient and societal savings of GBP675 per patient”,* and that *“your research on the implementation and scale up of primary care innovations informed efforts by our Impact Accelerator Unit \(GPs, physiotherapists and patient representatives\) to spread STarT Back for patient benefit”* **\(5.5\)**. 

 **Scaling up the use of a Dimensions of Health and Wellbeing Tool, designed to help young people self\-manage their mental health condition and access services developed by Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust \(CWPT\):** CWPT provide mental health and learning disability services for more than 1,000,000 people of all ages. Despite the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions presenting in young people, services have not kept pace and youth mental health has been under\-resourced, hence dubbed the ‘Cinderella’ of healthcare provision. This necessitates much more emphasis upon young people and their carers self\-managing their condition. Drawing upon their insights about the need for distributed leadership to scale up innovation **\(3.5\)** and the knowledge brokering capabilities of middle managers to embed innovation in practice **\(3.8\)**, the research team from WBS worked alongside frontline clinicians and managers to put the Dimensions of Health and Wellbeing Tool in place to support patient self\-management. Dr. Sharon Binyon, Medical Director, and Dominic Cox, Director of Strategy and Development, at CWPT, describe how WBS research alerted them to, and suggested solutions for, diffusing the innovation, stating that “This has ensured smooth roll out of the tool with maximum patient benefit; i.e. those young people that need access to services are able to identify and get the care they need quickly, and so outcomes for them are much improved"" **\(5.6\)**. 

 **Supporting Leadership and Digital Innovation at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire’s \(UHCW\):** As part of CLAHRC WM research, the WBS research team worked closely with the management at board, middle and frontline levels within UHCW, an NHS Trust that manages 2 major hospitals in Coventry and Rugby, serving a population of over 1,000,000 people. UHCW CEO, Andrew Hardy, confirmed the research **\(3.5\-6\)** had supported the hospital’s Executive Board saying it “ *was very useful for the board to understand the strategic context in which we work and the part that we play in it as leaders and our interaction with them. We now have a common way of trying to lead in the organisation, a common language, and actually understanding what we are about, and that feeds directly into patient care’’* **\(5.7\)**. 

 CEO Hardy added that the research **\(3.6\-8\)** had also “ *brought attention to the role of the middle manager \- what the tensions are, the pressures in house and how you deal with that and the effects it can have as well”* **\(5.7\)**. This insight led UHCW to commission a leadership development programme, which embeds lessons from research to support a newly\-constituted clinical directorate leadership team to enhance their capability to develop supportive HR practices for their departments **\(3.7\)**. The Hospital also changed its existing distributed leadership development programme delivered to frontline staff, to drive evidence\-based service innovation, based on WBS research insights **\(3.5\)**. CEO Hardy recognised the contributions made by the WBS team to improving leadership across the organisation more broadly, linking this to a recently awarded, improved rating of 'Good' from the Care Quality Commission **\(5.7\)**. 

 Additionally, CEO Hardy confirmed **\(5.7\)** that the research **\(3.5\)**, conducted alongside Consultant Clinical Oncologist, Penny Kechagioglou, informed UHCW’s digital healthcare innovation strategy, enabling digital technology to be embedded in the oncology care pathway across different organisations and professions, with improvements to services and clinical outcomes. 

 **The implementation model and innovation approaches have been applied internationally, improving health service delivery in India and Australia:** In India, WBS researchers worked with the Schizophrenia Research Foundation \(SCARF\), a non\-governmental, not\-for\-profit organisation providing psychiatric care and rehabilitation services across the whole of Tamil Nadu State. The body of WBS research **\(3.1\-8\)** supported SCARF with the implementation and scale up of an early intervention services for young people with psychosis **\(5.8\)**. SCARF Director, Dr. Thara Rangaswamy, said insights from research outcomes had been “ *eye\-opening”,* writing that: *“T*hrough incorporating lessons learnt from your implementation science research, we have improved our services, reaching 10\-15% more people than we have done before to reduce prospects of serious mental health among this group’’ **\(5.9\)**. 

 In Australia, WBS research **\(3.1\-4\)** has supported Monash Partners Academic Health Science Centre \(MP AHSC\) and other AHSCs across Australia to improve implementation and scale up of evidence\-based healthcare innovation. Director MPAHSC, Prof. Helena Teede, confirmed that the research insights had been “invaluable”. She added that reciprocal exchange of ideas had “informed and accelerated our impact in implementation and healthcare improvement” and the research had made a “national impact on the thinking and evolution of AHSCs \[the Australian equivalent to CLAHRCs\] across Australia” **\(5.10\)**.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Centre for Electronic Imaging \(CEI\), a collaboration between The Open University and Teledyne e2v \(Te2v\), is dedicated to the research and development of advanced image sensor technologies. Led by Professor Andrew **Holland**, the CEI has over 30 academics, researchers and PhD students. Since its formation in 2004, CEI members have contributed to over 14 international space missions led by European, US and Indian agencies. 

 Our fundamental semiconductor research has led to improvements in device design and the development of new analysis methods for in\-flight and laboratory use. In 2014, a **new technique called ‘trap pumping’** was developed **\[O1\]** for characterisation of defects in silicon caused by spaceborne radiation. Trap pumping has orders of magnitude greater sensitivity in defect identification than previous methods and provides a **step change in the understanding of radiation damage effects**. This knowledge was used to optimise the operation and the working temperature of the imagers and has led to key developments in the applications of Charged Coupled Devices \(CCDs\) for space\-based imaging **\[O2\]**, including the development of radiation hard p\-channel CCDs **\[O3\]**. 

 Since 2013, we have been developing soft\-X ray imaging systems and analysis software that improve the energy and the spatial resolution of Electron Multiplying CCDs \(EMCCDs\), opening up new applications in synchrotron imaging **\[O4\]**. Following this research, we demonstrated excellent **single\-photon\-counting performance in electron multiplying CCDs** \(EMCCD\) after irradiation equivalent to that experienced in\-flight. Subsequently, through further device design and simulation, we showed for the first time that CEI\-modified Te2v **EMCCDs are suitable for space\-based astronomy**. 

 The CEI demonstrated a new charge transport channel and output in CCDs with a factor of 4 improvement in radiation hardness and much reduced readout noise. Coupled with optimisation of the operating conditions, we showed that the **X\-ray detection threshold can be improved** from 2,000 eV to below 300 eV in a large area CCD, even at the expected end\-of\-life irradiation dose in a space environment. 

 Further expanding our sensor and radiation damage expertise, we formed a new research team on complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor \(CMOS\) image sensor development. With UKSA funding, the CMOS research team was able to **qualify the Te2v CIS115 sensor** for the harsh radiation environment that will be experienced by ESA’s JUICE spacecraft around Jupiter and its moons. Furthermore, the team has optimised the linearity and image lag behaviour of CIS115 **\[O5\]**, leading to better performance of the flight camera. 

 Working under a grant jointly awarded to the CEI and Te2v during 2012\-2015, the CMOS research team was tasked with addressing several challenges in image sensor technology. The most pressing of these was increasing the sensitivity to near\-infrared \(NIR\) light of silicon devices based on the ubiquitous pinned photodiode photosensitive element. Simulation work yielded a novel pixel design, subsequently called ‘HiRho CMOS’, for which a **patent application was granted** **\[O6\]**. The new pixel delivers **an order of magnitude higher NIR quantum efficiency** than CMOS image sensors available in 2020 and was experimentally proven in 2016 in a project funded by the UK Space Agency **\[O7\]**. This invention also allows CMOS image sensors to be adopted as soft X\-ray detectors due to the much thicker sensitive detector volume, marking another milestone in the adoption of CMOS technology over the previously preferred CCD. Presently, a sensor based on this patent is being developed by us for the forthcoming THESEUS X\-ray space telescope led by ESA.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Our ground\-breaking research in CCDs and CMOS image sensors has led to benefits for industry and space agencies. Impacts in the area of **commerce and the economy** include increased sales, new and improved products, and protected jobs for a range of beneficiaries, including a large UK\-based multinational \(Teledyne e2v\), its subsidiary \(Teledyne AnaFocus\), ESA and a SME \(XCAM Ltd.\). The improved performance of our novel, patented technology has also created opportunities beyond space, in Medical and Scientific imaging. 

 **Impact on Teledyne e2v** 

 Our strategic collaboration with Te2v over the last 16 years \(12 years at the OU\), as well as our close working relationships with the Space Agencies, who are a core market for Te2v products, have been our primary **pathways to impact.** This is confirmed by the comments of the Te2v President \(Space & Quantum\) and Site Director at Chelmsford, who says: 

 ""*The \[CEI\-Te2v\] collaboration brings both parties increased academic and commercial success, with the CEI producing key IP for future projects and being involved with over GBP4M of Teledyne e2v customer contracts in the past 12 months alone*"" **\[C1\]**. 

 The Chief Engineer of Te2v explains: 

 *“Teledyne e2v is a world\-leading manufacturer of CCD and CMOS image sensors for science and space applications. Our high\-performance devices have been deployed in a large number of ground and space\-based telescopes such as Hubble, VLT and Gaia, and also in numerous space probes by ESA and NASA, such as New Horizons. Our image sensor sales are almost exclusively for export and \[text removed for publication\] we employ around 250 staff in the UK. Understanding radiation damage effects in CCDs and CMOS image sensors is very important to our business. The research conducted by the CEI has been crucial in mitigating the radiation damage effects in CCDs for many space\-based imaging instruments*” **\[C2\]**. 

 CEI’s research **\[O1\]** has greatly improved the radiation resistance of CCDs used in major ESA and NASA space missions such as Euclid, SMILE and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope \(formerly WFIRST\). Our research has improved the performance of CCD technology through design and optimisation **\[O2\]**, so that the science requirements of the missions can be met. By demonstrating this, the sensors were adopted for the missions, resulting in major contracts for CCD manufacture to Te2v. The Chief Engineer continues: 

 “*The CEI\-Te2v collaboration has been crucial to demonstrate that CCDs are suitable for the Euclid, SMILE, and WFIRST space missions. This has helped us secure contracts for CCD manufacture \[text removed for publication\] \[during the period 2013\-2020\] supporting a significant fraction of the jobs at our plant in Chelmsford*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Our work on CMOS imaging technology started much later than that on CCDs, but the impact is increasing rapidly and is on track to prove equally significant. Following the radiation characterisation and optimisation conducted at the CEI, the Te2v\-made CIS115 has been adopted into ESA’s billion\-euro JUICE mission to Jupiter \[text removed for publication\] **\[C3**, p.1 **\]**. JUICE makes full use of the excellent radiation performance of CIS115 **\[O4\]** and its higher operating temperature. This allows the spacecraft to be lighter and survive longer in the harsh radiation environment in orbit around Jupiter for greater scientific return. Our research has been crucial for the selection of CIS115 and for the achievement of the mission’s planned objectives. 

 CIS115 has now been adopted by several future space missions, such as ALTIUS \(funded by the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy \[text removed for publication\]\), and for an instrument on the future Comet Interceptor spacecraft. Due to extensive characterisation and optimisation conducted at the CEI, the CIS115 sensor is now being offered by Te2v as a fully space\-qualified product **\[C4\]**. 

 Using a patent **\[O6\]** generated by the CEI, Te2v has developed a new product line of CMOS image sensors with ten\-fold increase in their near\-infrared quantum efficiency, aimed at the scientific and space markets. The Chief Engineer at Te2v testifies: 

 “*The IP in CMOS image sensors generated by the CEI is now being used to develop two new image sensor families at Te2v. The first one to be launched is the HiRho fully depleted sensor with enhanced near\-infrared sensitivity, based on a patented invention at the CEI. We have already received \[text removed for publication\] contracts from ESA with a follow\-on contract expected soon for the development of these sensors for space\-based imaging. Over the last few years we have been observing an increased demand for CMOS imagers with high quantum efficiency at visible and near\-infrared wavelengths for various applications, including astronomy and adaptive optics, but also for hyperspectral imaging from space, microscopy, spectroscopy and surveillance. The development of such high QE devices will help strengthen our market position*” **\[C2\]**. 

 Teledyne AnaFocus has also developed a new product based on the same patent **\[O6\]**, aimed at industrial time\-of\-flight and machine vision applications. The VP and General Manager of Teledyne e2v and Teledyne AnaFocus comments: 

 “*By using the HiRho patented technology invented at Open University **\[O6\]**, we have developed a new Time\-of\-Flight CMOS image sensor with much increased near\-infrared sensitivity \[…\]\[text removed for publication\]we have also established a dedicated team \[…\] and created 15 new jobs. Furthermore, Teledyne e2v has started two new projects in Medical and Scientific imaging with HiRho technology, which will allow both new products to benefit from this invention and achieve outstanding performance*” **\[C5\]**. 

 **Impact on XCAM** 

 XCAM is an SME based in Northampton that specialises in providing innovative CCD and CMOS\-based solutions for challenging imaging applications **\[C6\]**. Long\-term collaboration between the CEI and XCAM has helped develop expertise in complete camera systems, with demonstrated history in vacuum\-compatible applications and large\-area, multi detector solutions. XCAM’s CEO states: 

 “*Through collaboration agreements with the Centre for Electronic Imaging \(CEI\), we have worked together to apply their research outputs \(e.g. Soman et al. \(2013\) NIM\-A, vol. 731 pp 47\-52\) **\[O4\]** into next\-generation X\-ray cameras designed for the Resonant Inelastic X\-ray Scattering technique at synchrotron facilities*” **\[C6\]**. 

 \[Text removed for publication.\] 

 **Impact on ESA and the UK Space Agency** 

 The European Space Agency \(ESA\) is tasked with delivering space capability to its 22 member states, with much of the UK’s role directed by the UK Space Agency \(UKSA\). ESA and the UKSA conduct space exploration, earth observation and technology development for the benefit of the citizens of Europe and the world. 

 Cryogenic irradiation and trap pumping, two of the new research methods developed and championed by the CEI **\[O1\]**, have helped reduce the radiation damage effects in CCDs and have increased the performance of the Euclid VIS instrument. This is equivalent to increasing the lifetime of this EUR600,000,000 space telescope by 20% \(an additional year\) **\[O2\]**, with the corresponding greater scientific return. Without our radiation damage research Euclid would not have been selected by ESA, and no contracts for CCD manufacture would have been placed. UKSA’s Director of Programmes states: 

 “*New techniques developed and demonstrated by the CEI \[…\] have had a dramatic improvement on the understanding of radiation damage in silicon with subsequent impact to many space missions using CCDs*” **\[C7\]**. 

 UKSA’s Director of Programmes continues: 

 “*Furthermore, CEI research on Teledyne e2v’s p\-channel CCDs has firmly established that p\-channel CCD technology can offer better radiation hardness than the usual n\-channel CCDs. The results of their initial study **\[O3\]** generated great interest in the technology and led to the production of a new device based on the results of the initial research by the CEI*” **\[C7\]**. 

 Our research into p\-channel CCDs resulted in two follow\-on contracts between ESA and the Open University \[text removed for publication\] **\[C1\]**. Our research into soft X\-ray detection by CCDs **\[O4\]** enabled the required science performance for the SMILE mission to be met and this joint European\-Chinese satellite to go ahead. Modified Te2v EMCCDs are now \(2020\) in production for NASA’s Roman Space Telescope, the first use of this technology in space\-based astronomy. The new devices are being tested in the CEI laboratories in collaboration with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a novel detection technique, known as Mass Photometry, which is capable of weighing molecules with light. It enables the accurate mass measurement of proteins and other molecules in solution, in their native state and without the need for labels – a simple yet powerful capability that is useful across the life sciences, in research and in industry. In June 2018, the University of Oxford spin\-out company Refeyn was formed to commercialise the research. Following formation, Refeyn **\[text removed for publication\]** has since sold and installed **\[text removed for publication\]** of its first generation Refeyn OneMP mass photometers to pharma companies, research laboratories and facilities worldwide, accelerating and enabling new science for working with and studying biomolecules in both the academic and pharmaceutical space. **\[Text removed for publication\]** 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professors Philipp Kukura and Justin Benesch from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oxford have pioneered a new technique known as Mass Photometry \(MP\). MP relies on the accurate determination of scattering contrast for single molecules as they approach a refractive index interface, for example between a solution and a glass slide. The scattering contrast of biomolecules is closely related to its mass and therefore simply by imaging a molecule as it binds to a microscope slide, the mass can be accurately calculated \[ **R1**\]. 

 This discovery follows a significant period of foundational research. Professor Kukura’s group has been working the related technique, interferometric scattering microscopy \(iSCAT\), for more than 10 years. The group had previously shown the utility of iSCAT for studying molecular motors, such as Myosin 5a \[ **R2**\]. Arguably, the group’s most important breakthrough was the 2014 demonstration that iSCAT is sufficiently sensitive to detect and image individual proteins without any labels \[ **R3**\]. Additional advances in detection sensitivity by an order of magnitude \[ **R4**\] led to the further demonstration that light scattering can be used not only to visualise single molecules, which has intrinsic advantages over ensemble\-based methods, but also – by careful quantification of the detected signals – to measure their mass with high accuracy, precision, resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range \[ **R1**\]. 

 In recognition of its potential to become an indispensable tool for researchers working across the life sciences, two grants were awarded to further develop the technology and bring it to market: an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account award \(2017\) and an ERC Proof of Concept Award \(2018\). 

 In Professor Benesch’s group, research over the previous decade focussed on developing, enhancing and demonstrating the value of measurements of mass and mass distributions for quantitatively characterising biomolecules and their interactions. In the growing field of native mass spectrometry \(MS\), his group has led efforts to bring both the experimental approach and its analysis onto a quantitative footing. Advances made by the group have been key in driving mass measurement to the forefront of biophysical investigation, showing that it is the best way to quantify the assembly states of biomolecules and the strengths of their interactions. This work is paving the way to a new era of molecular biology understanding, grounded in the fundamental quantities of physical chemistry \[ **R5**\]. 

 The success and potential of MP comes from the confluence of advances in the Kukura and Benesch groups: the Kukura group’s development of a fundamentally new method of measuring mass and the Benesch group’s work advancing mass itself as a valuable measure for the life sciences.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Pathway to impact: from research to commercialisation 

 The research and development of mass photometry \(MP\) in Kukura and Benesch’s research groups attracted attention after publication in Science in 2018 \[ **R1, E1**\- **2**\]. The combination of experimental power and feasibility led many academic institutions and commercial enterprises to express an interest in obtaining the technology to analyse their own samples. In the 18 months following publication of MP, an enormous variety of samples and scientific questions were brought to the Kukura lab by more than 30 international collaborators from a variety of scientific backgrounds. The interests of these groups ranged from developing and interrogating antibody\-based pharmaceuticals to the manufacture and quality control of inorganic nanoparticles. 

 Throughout MP’s development, the researchers worked closely with Oxford University Innovation \(OUI\), the technology transfer company for the University of Oxford, to protect the new IP being developed. Recognising the potential impact of this technology, OUI filed 2 patents, with one covering the key aspects of the MP device, *Interferometric scattering microscopy* \[ **E3**\], and another a key implementation of the technology, *Method of determining lipoprotein concentration in solution using light scattering* \[ **E4**\]. The former has been granted in the US and in Europe. 

 OUI and the academic team identified the formation of a spin\-out company as the most appropriate route to maximise the impact from this platform technology. In June 2018, University of Oxford spin\-out company Refeyn \(initially known as Arago Biosciences\) successfully raised **\[text removed for publication\]** from several sources, including Oxford Sciences Innovation, to further develop the technology and make it widely available as an instrument accessible to non\-expert users. Within months, the company had made its first sales to academic institutions and continued to expand the capabilities of the microscope. The founding of the company was extremely rapid: an EPSRC IAA award in October 2017 enabled construction of a first commercial prototype, which was presented at an international conference in February 2018, 2 months before the original manuscript was published, which in turn was 4 months before Refeyn was founded. \[ **E5**\] 

 Following a highly successful first 8 months in operation, Refeyn raised a further **\[text removed for publication\]** led by Foresight Williams and Oxford Sciences Innovation with the aim of expanding its development pipeline and scaling up production of its existing product, the Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup>. Subsequently, Refeyn raised another **\[text removed for publication\]** during the COVID\-19 pandemic, led by high profile US investors Northpond Ventures \[ **E5**\]. 

###  Innovative new technology 

 The ability to observe the often\-subtle interactions between proteins is crucial for studying the processes that underpin life itself. Only through a deep understanding of these processes can we begin to develop the next generation of biopharmaceuticals to tackle previously untreatable diseases. The MP approach ‘weighs molecules with light’, providing immediate insight into the state of proteins and other molecules. 

 In mass photometry, the light scattered by a molecule attached to the measurement interface interferes with light reflected at that interface. The interference scales linearly with object mass. The Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> detects this scattered light, using the signal to count molecules and measure their mass. This is possible in a wide range of native buffer solutions, without the need for labels. 


 Figure 1. Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> benchtop mass photometry device \(above\). 

 Figure 2. The principle of mass photometry \(right\). 






 The Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> featured in The Scientist’s \(a professional magazine for life scientists\) Top 10 Innovations of 2019. The Boris Magasanik Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology **\[text removed for publication\]** was quoted as saying “ *The most valuable thing with this instrument is that we can look at complex proteins\-macromolecular complexes and figure out what are the components in that mixture, and do we detect any issue with stability. It’s a very time\-consuming process in typical workflow*.” \[ **E6**\] 

 In 2019 Refeyn went on to win the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Emerging Technologies Competition Award and an R&D 100 award in the analytical/test category \[ **E11**\]. 

###  Commercial sales and use 

 **\[Text removed for publication\]** 

 The instruments are being used across vaccine development, cell and gene therapy production, Quality Assurance/Quality Control of biologics, and next generation drug discovery \[ **E5**\]. More than 20 academic publications have explicitly used the instrument in the broader and more specific bioanalytical context \[ **E7**\]. For example, AstraZeneca have used Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> in COVID\-19 research to study the spike protein of the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus and its interaction with the ACE2 receptor \[ **E8**\], and for drug discovery to explore the characterization of star polymers for future biophysical targeting of tumours \[ **E9**\]. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health \(USA\) used MP to measure the affinity of protein\-protein interactions on a single\-molecule level, concluding ‘ *The quality and information content of the MP data, combined with simple and fast measurements and low sample consumption makes MP a new preferred method for measuring strong protein\-protein interactions*.’ \[ **E10**\] 

 In just 2 years the uptake and variety of uses seen across the scientific community show that mass photometry is a transformative technology enabling a new way to analyze molecules. It has opened up new possibilities for bioanalytics and research into the functions of biomolecules across the life sciences.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Conventional diagnostics and drug development are costly, complex and time consuming, often requiring the use of animals. Antibodies are vital in this process but are frequently unreliable, fragile and costly to manufacture. Research at the University of Leicester \(UoL\), led by Prof. Sergey Piletsky, has addressed these issues with the use of Molecularly Imprinted Polymer nanoparticles \(NanoMIPs\). 

 NanoMIPs are a versatile, reliable and cost\-effective alternative to antibodies, do not require animals for their production, and have improved development time by up to 600%. This research has been commercialised via a spinout company, MIP Diagnostics Limited, which provides a range of custom synthetics to world\-leading pharmaceutical companies. Patents and licences have been issued to advance a range of gene therapies to treat rare diseases and development of new diagnostic tools. Impact from this research is both **economic** \(GBP5,100,000 investment and secured employment in high tech area for 17 researchers and engineers\), and **increased capability** \(development of manufacturing facilities for addressing needs of the diagnostic industry in new materials and reagents as a replacement for antibodies\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Traditional antibodies are vital tools for drug discovery and point\-of care diagnostics, but they are expensive and time consuming to produce and can be unreliable due to their fragility and propensity to biodegrade. NanoMIPs solve these challenges as they are robust and created bya highly predictable and reproducible process using the target molecule as a template **\[P1, P2\]**.A MIP binder with affinity and specificity similar to the best monoclonal antibodies can be produced cost\-effectively in under two weeks compared to several months for a traditional antibody. 

 Since 2014, UoL researchers have advanced the practical applications of nanoMIPs, produced using a solid\-phase approach, across diverse fields including: molecular diagnostics; drug discovery, development and delivery; petrochemicals; and law enforcement. Their research can be broadly categorised in two distinct areas: 

 **The Use of MIP Nanoparticles in Diagnostics** 

 Prior to Leicester Biotechnology Group research at UoL, nanoMIP utility was limited by the high binding site heterogeneity, the presence of residual template and the need for complex production methods. These issues were solved by the introduction of a solid\-phase approach to synthesis **\[R1\]**. The resulting nanoMIPs were virtually free of template and showed a high \(“monoclonal”\) affinity for the target molecule. This result enabled the first successful use of nanoMIPs in assays and sensors without a cold chain supply **\[R2, P3\]**, providing similar affinity and selectivity to monoclonal antibodies **\[R3\]**. Being able to utilise nanoMIPs in assays represented a significant step\-change in the field and within three years the UoL team developed novel nanoMIP\-based assays for biomarkers, drugs and proteins with demonstrable superiority to existing products\(e.g. ELISA\) in terms of user\-friendliness of the protocol, and its speed **\[R3\]**. 

 The discovery was also significant in that it provided a method of production that was not reliant on animals because the use of synthetics negates the requirement for an active immune response. 

 **Targeting Cells Using nanoMIPs** 

 UoL research provides significant advances in the potential use of nanoMIPs in both *in vitro*and *in vivo* therapeutic applications, as well as in bioimaging and drug discovery. 

 Building on their successful demonstration of the ability of nanoMIPs to safely penetrate cell membranes and thus deliver a targeted drug dosage to the patient **\[R4\]**, the team were ableto accelerate their development for a wide range of medical conditions including: 

-  New nanoMIPs to target antitumor activity in both kidney and cardiovascular systems **\[R5\]**. 

-  New nanoMIPs targeting the quorum sensing system in Gram\-positive and Gram\-negative bacteria, which for the first time demonstrated that nanoMIPs can prevent streptococcus\-induced pneumonia **\[R6\]**. 

-  Original protocols for the identification of protein epitopes that can be used to generate antibodies, aptamers and MIPs in addition to enabling snapshot imprinting of cell membranes **\[P4\]**. 

-  Novel approach for preventing the inactivation of viral vectors by Adeno\-Associated Viruses and enhancement of efficiency of gene therapy **\[P5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The market for research antibodies and reagents is estimated to be worth USD10,100,000,000 **\[E1\]**. Progress has been limited by inherent challenges including antibody fragility, expense, complexity and time required to produce **\[E2\]**. Recent developments in the computational design and automated synthesis of nanoMIPs by the UoL team has meant that a reliable supply of soluble nanoparticles with predetermined molecular recognition properties, sub\-nanomolar affinities, defined size and surface chemistry, is available for industrial use for the first time **\[R1, P1, P2\],** which is essential for **increasing industrial capabilities**. This represents significant progress, ensuring that diagnostic applications, drug discovery and the subsequent benefits to patient health outcomes can be accelerated, with creation of nanoMIPs using LBG technology taking less than two weeks on average in comparison to several months required for the development of antibodies **\[R1, E2\]**. These technological achievements were supported by several new patents enabling large\-scale diagnostic applications **\[P1–P6\]**. 

 The emergence of nanoMIPs as an alternative to antibodies in diagnostics and in vivo applications is due primarily to the research of the UoL team **\[E2\]**. As NittoDenko writes: 

 “*The group was able to hit targets that several experienced researchers working in parallel were unable to achieve. Their use of in\-silico modelling in combination with a simple, low cost, solid\-phase extraction protocol was able to achieve the desired results in rapid time”* **\[E3\]**. 

 The diagnostic applications of nanoMIPs have been further supported by two new inventions:\(i\) Development of a novel MIP\-based assay performed in magnetic microplates \(culminating in translation and adoption of assays by AstraZeneca, Thermo Fisher and other companies for the analysis of blood antigens, leukotrienes, insulin and other proteins\) **\[R2\]**. 

 \(ii\) Discovery of a method for transforming binding events into detectable signals using redox\-active nanoMIPs **\[P3\]**. This process enables integration of nanoMIPs into a broad range of sensor devices, using advanced manufacturing tools such as screen and ink\-jet printers. This technology is licensed to MIP Diagnostics Limited \(a UoL spinout company\) with the intention of developing commercial products for a leading diagnostic company and tapping into the huge global biosensor market valued at USD18,600,000,000 **\[E1\]**. 

 Commercialisation of nanoMIP technology developed by the UoL team has been accomplished primarily via MIP Diagnostics Limited **\[E2, E4\]**. MIP Diagnostics Limited, founded in 2013 with the intention to commercialise technology developed by the UoL team, has continued to grow over the last seven years. The original GBP1,500,000 funding came from Mercia Fund Managers. In making their decision to support the company, Mercia concluded that “recent research has highlighted the benefits of MIPs and blue\-chip companies are starting to recognise their potential, in particular in applications where antibodies cannot be used. This funding will allow MIP Diagnostics to make a step change in the business, by ... developing its own products to take advantage of the huge global market” **\[E2\]**. 

 At present, the company employs a team of 17 highly skilled scientists and engineers, currently generates over GBP750,000 in revenue per year, and has secured repeat business with a range of leading global blue\-chip clients **\[E4\]**. In 2018, MIP Diagnostics Limited was recognised as the *“Best MIP Commercialisation Specialists in the UK”* **\[E5\]**. In July 2020, MIP Diagnostics Limited completed a GBP5,100,000 funding round to accelerate its global expansion. The co\-investment has come from Mercia Asset Management, a founding investor and the largest shareholder in the company, and was led by Downing Ventures, BGF and Calculus Capital. This development enabled MIP Diagnostics Limited to grow, expand and diversify its product portfolio and capability as a result of the improved cost\-efficiency provided by the use of synthetic binders rather than natural antibodies *. “To date, 5 licenses have been issued, primarily to the in vitro diagnostics industry but also to some bioprocessing companies”* **\[E4\]**. This is the second time that Mercia chose to invest in MIP Diagnostics, indicating their trust and confidence in the technology, and also in the future commercial success of the company. 

 The collaboration with the UoL team and MIP Diagnostics has continued in recent years, diversifying from diagnostics to other areas, as recognised by the company: *“The research from Leicester has also led to the company building further expertise in epitope mapping* \[experimentally identifying the binding site of an antibody on its target antigen \(usually, on a protein\)\] *, and sensor technology which has increased our business capabilities to pursue our strategic objectives*” **\[E5\]**. 

 MIP Diagnostics is now fulfilling an increasing number of requests from major diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies for custom nanoMIP synthesis to be used in a diverse range of biomedical applications including biomedical monitoring and diagnostics. NanoMIP technology is now being applied to numerous diagnostic fields including cardiac disease, cancer and autoimmune conditions, providing high temperature resistance and excellent selectivity over traditional bioreceptors in a biosensor platform **\[P3\]**. Since its establishment, MIP Diagnostics Limited have successfully developed over 50 publicly available technologies with targets stretching from cocaine, salbutamol and copper to haemoglobin and insulin. Other examples involve development of a troponin I assay based on nanoMIP suitable for cardiovascular disease monitoring and an interference suppression solution for Veravas **\[E6\]**. 

 This considerable success is set to continue, with planned expansion into the Oil and Gas industries as well as Security/Law Enforcement where the value and utility of nanoMIP technology is emerging. The influence on national and international law enforcement practice is via the *BorderSens* project for the European Union which, by 2023, will result in the creation of a portable, wireless device with the capacity to quickly test for illegal drugs and be utilised by European Border Control in the fight against organised crime. The creation of this device is dependent upon field\-leading UoL research into nanoMIPs which are critical in its operation **\[E8\]**. 

 The non\-diagnostic applications of MIP technology that have an impact on healthcare evolved from collaboration with Genethon. Genethon is a non\-profit biotherapy R&D organization created and funded by the Association Française Contre les Myopathies. Its mission is to design gene therapy products for rare diseases. Its work with the UoL MIPs team has been supported as part of a GBP6,000,000 EU funding \(CureCN grant\) **\[E9\]**. The technology developed by UoL in partnership with Genethon **\[P3\]** is being used within the Immunology and Liver disease team at Genethon to address pre\-existing humoral immunity against Adeno\-Associated Virus Vector, by removing circulating anti\-AAV neutralizing antibodies. Genethon has acknowledged that this technology is “ *a very useful tool in the gene therapy field*” **\[E10\]**. 

 The COVID\-19 global pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for rapid and accurate diagnostic solutions, to enable mass testing and screening, antigen\-detecting rapid diagnostics tests are quickly being developed. In April 2020, MIP Diagnostics announced a new venture with Stream Bio, “ *a company that develops and manufactures a range of transformative bioimaging molecular probes, to develop a COVID\-19 antigen reagent for assays, a lateral flow Rapid Diagnostic Test and an ‘ELISA’ type assay for high throughput screening or mass testing*” **\[E7\]**. MIP Diagnostics has developed a SARS\-COV\-2 nanoMIP demonstrating a high sensitivity and high affinity to the COVID\-19 spike protein and cultured virus. MIP Diagnostics have partnered with Stream Bio to bring a ready conjugated SARS\-COV\-2 nanoMIP for fluorescent\-based assays to market **\[E11\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Panos Vostanis since 2004 and through the World Awareness for Children in Trauma Programme \(WACIT\) is improving mental health services for children traumatised by war, displacement and abuse. Since 2015, WACIT supported >44,000 children and their carers worldwide to cope with trauma. Vostanis trained 1,200 front\-line professionals in 14 countries to recognise trauma in children, implement psychosocial interventions, reduce stigma, and improve mental health and education for children. Vostanis’ research informed global policies and practices, including UNESCO trauma\-reduction policies \(2018, 2019\) and The World Health Organization’s 2018 care guidance for one million asylum\-seeking children registered in the EU. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The United Nations estimates that >1billion children worldwide suffer complex trauma from war, displacement, violence, and disadvantage. Prof Panos Vostanis’ research shows that these children experience 40% higher rates of mental health disorders \( **MHD**\)—depression, anxiety, self\-harm, post\-traumatic and conduct disorders—by the age of 18 than the general population **,** with adverse outcomes into adulthood including unemployment, criminality, sexual exploitation, and homelessness \[ **R1, R2, R3**\]. 

 Vostanis and team established high psychopathology rates for looked\-after and displaced children in Britain. Children looked after by local authorities are four times more likely to develop MHDs than children living with their families \(46.4% versus 8.5%\) \[ **R1**\]. Vostanis and team \(2007\) examined socio\-demographic characteristics and psychopathology among looked\-after children in Britain’s local authority care, compared with children in private households. Psychiatric disorders and severe behavioural difficulties were particularly high among children living in residential care, who may have also experienced multiple placements \[ **R1**\]. Vostanis’ studies of children traumatised by displacement and homelessness \[ **R2**\] showed severely high risks of MHD, sexual exploitation, and acute psychosocial problems. 

 Globally, Vostanis and team studied the impact of war and displacement \[ **R3, R4**\] on children. Childhood trauma can begin in utero from maternal stress, which can cause undernutrition, stunting, and negatively impacts on children’s cognitive, physical and socio\-emotional development \[ **R3**\]. For example, studying 403 Palestinian children aged 9\-15 in four refugee camps, children reported experiencing a wide range of traumatic events, both direct experience of violence and through the media, reporting sleep disturbance, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration \[ **R4**\]. Vostanis’ British study showed that trauma interferes with education and social interactions, requiring teacher training to implement preventive interventions \[ **R5**\]. These findings support the need for global inter\-agency focus on *children’s needs* and *carers’ skills* integrated to existing service systems. 

 **Vostanis and team subsequently developed the **global** WACIT Programme \(2015 \- 2020\)** \[ **R8a,b**\] a six\-step strategy to implement early intervention to meet children’s mental health needs in low\- and middle\-income countries \(LMIC\). The team implemented their *Practice\-Focused Training on Mental Health Awareness, Recognition and Formulation of Care Plan* **to train 23 networks and 16 service delivery agencies in 14 countries**. The WACIT Team: **1.** Worked with children and parents to establish stakeholder *readiness* in Kenyan disadvantaged communities. This revealed barriers from stigma towards MH and disability, disengagement of parents and communities, lack of culturally adapted interventions, and limited resources \[ **R8a**\]. The Team devised service transformation strategies and an online module with stakeholder input \[ **R8a,b**\]. 

 **2.** Developed and implemented *practice\-focused training* to upskill care networks in six vulnerable LMIC target groups: Turkey \- street and refugee children; Pakistan \- slum areas; Indonesia \- orphanages; Brazil – favelas; Rwanda \- care homes; and Kenya \- slum areas following ethnic displacement \[ **R8b**\]. 

 **3.** Created the *WACIT Service Transformation Framework* \(STF\) and training manual \[ **R8a**\], implementing children’s rights, ecological systems, and hierarchy of needs. The WACIT STF is designed to improve mental health service provision across six psychosocial domains of: 1\) safety; 2\) carer support; 3\) schools and communities; 4\) upskilling frontline practitioners and community volunteers; 5\) counselling and psychological interventions; and 6\) access to mental health services. 

 **4.** Designed action plans for *community awareness* in Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa and Brazil for child and family empowerment; interdisciplinary working; and skills development, supported with the user\-led online module \[ **R6**\]. **5.** Interviewed 353 disadvantaged *children* in Turkey, Pakistan, Kenya, South Africa and Brazil to capture their *voices* relating to *help\-seeking and resilience strategies* \[ **R8a,b**\]. 

 **6.** Delivered leadership training to 14 university partners in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil, building on the WACIT programme’s training and educational resources \[ **R8a,b**\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 <ins> **Changing worldwide policies and support for traumatised children and carers**</ins> 

 The **World Health Organization** \(WHO\) \(2018\) used \[ **R7, R8b**\] evidence—that displaced children often internalise MHD— **to design targeted health care guidance for 1million asylum\-seeking children registered in the EU, including 200,000 unaccompanied children** \(2015–2017\) \[ **E1**\]. WHO \(2016\) drew on Vostanis et al.’s school mental\-health models \[ **R5**\] to recommend targeted school programmes **to improve literacy for displaced children** \[ **E1**\]. 

 Vostanis and Team’s evidence associating parent/carer support with PTSD reduction in war children and refugees \[ **R3, R6, R7, R8a,b**\] informed several **UN** and **UNESCO** recommendations. \[ **R3, R7**\] informed the UN’s *Global study on children deprived of liberty* \(2019\) and *Occupied Palestinian Territory Report* \(2016\), with both **recommending law, policy and practice safeguards to reduce stigmatisation of displaced children and protect their human rights** \[ **E2**\]. UNESCO \(2015\) implemented \[ **R6, R7, R8a,b**\] findings to **recommend evidence\-led training to reduce PTSD** by embedding caretaker/family communication and activities with traumatised Palestinian children \[ **E3**\]. UNESCO’s Policy Papers \(2019, 2015\) directly drew upon \[ **R5, R8b**\] to recommend an integrated programme involving schools, healthcare, communities, teachers, and families, to holistically support traumatised children \[ **E3**\]. 

 **The NSPCC** *Priorities for Change* \(2015\) \[ **E4**\] and the **Department for Education** \(DOE\) report \(2015\) \[ **E5**\] implemented the Team’s findings that carers may be unequipped to manage MHD in looked\-after children \[ **R1 – R3**\], **recommending carer/child interventions to prevent placement and attachment breakdown**. The NSPCC \(2016 *\) Case for Change* used \[ **R2**\] evidence **to demand mental\-health monitoring for infants in care to prevent later\-life MHD** \[ **E4**\]. The prevalence of unsupported refugee children with PTSD \[ **R4**\] informed the *European Union Policy Report* \(2019\) decision to **devise a national committee for inclusive systems in EU Member States**, integrating education, health and social services to support minority children – with refugees co\-designing anti\-bullying and anti\-prejudice curricular resources \[ **E7**\]. *The Migration Policy Institute Report* \(USA, 2015\) used \[ **R4**\] to **recommend multi\-agency educational and mental health interventions for Syrian refugee children** \[ **E6**\]. 

 **Transformed mental\-health care in <ins>14 countries**</ins> 

 Building on \[ **R1 – R5**\], Vostanis and team collaborated with **29 NGOs, clinical services and community centres in 14 LMICs** to design—often from nothing—sustainable service\-delivery frameworks \[ **R8a,b**\]. The Team **trained >1,200 service providers \(SP\)** in health/social care, education, or the community \(each with an average caseload of 50 children annually\) to identify trauma and provide support for **>44,000 children and young people who have experienced trauma in slums, orphanages, refugee camps, and care facilities**. \[ **R8a,b, E8**\]. 

 <ins>Professional and community practice</ins> 

 Practitioners in Asia \(430\); Latin America \(210\); and Africa \(460\) stated that **WACIT training** \[ **R8a,b**\] **strengthened their strategic practices and improved relationships with children**. WACIT’s three\-year programme in South Africa *“strengthened the relationship between me and the young people. And I’ve seen behaviour change.”* – Care home manager. In Kenya, WACIT’s three\-year interventions *“gave me . . . impetus to continue. I have come up with various strategic plans in the church that target young people. I have now almost 100 kids and 50 young men and ladies . . . and every week we hold training for them”.* \- Pastor caring for slum and displaced children \[ **E8**\]. 

 <ins>Government and NGO policy and practice</ins> 

 Eighteen Government and NGO managers \(Turkey, Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Brazil\) stated that \[ **R8a,b**\] **raised practitioners’ child\-mental\-health awareness and directly changed their policy and practice**, with a demonstrable effect on carers’ thinking, behaviours, and confidence. After WACIT’s four\-year programme in Turkey, an NGO caring for >400 refugee and street children and families stated: *“We improved our connection with other NGOs. We organised trainings for volunteers . . . and collaborated with municipalities. So, parents, children, government and NGOs worked together”* \[ **E8**\]. 

 The CEO of NGO disability care homes in Rwanda stated \[ **R8a,b**\] **significantly improved care\-workers’, knowledge, capabilities and confidence.** Workers *“feel that they have actually achieved something: most of our carers have had absolutely no training whatsoever. \[M\]any of them would struggle to write their own names – they have lived very desperate lives. \[T\]hey love the knowledge, and that someone is showing them respect and giving them the confidence that they lacked. \[N\]o one has ever done that before”* \[ **E8**\]. 

 The UK Department for International Development \(DfID\) Programme Manager in Syria stated \[ **R8a,b**\] **raised DfiD’s awareness** **of psychosocial support **“to break down stigma”**, with** \[ **R8a,b**\] **now embedded into their strategic practice**. *“We started teacher training \[and\] implanting case work. \[This is\] new to the programme, and . . . within DfID. Now, these issues \[are\] looked at in the highest scale.”* **This increased traumatised children’s ability to share difficult experiences and emotions**. *“\[W\]e’re seeing results. Now children in Syria are more open to talk about and express their feelings. \[WACIT is\] being pushed a long way and . . . creating more safe space.”* \[ **E8**\].

 Vostanis’ attachment research \[ **R7, R8a,b**\] improved parenting skills and child\-parent relationships, **equipping children with trust in secure relationships**. A care worker in South Africa stated: *“I'm no longer \[seen as\] toxic, where the auntie or the mom who shout.”* \[ **E8**\]. WACIT’s attachment\-focused interventions \[ **R7**\] reduced **PTSS and other MH symptoms by 50%, and improved attachment relationships for 15 refugee families in Turkey** \[ **E8**\]. A child said: *“All of the \[interventions\] were useful for me”*. A parent said: *“\[My son\] started to direct his excessive power to something positive.”* \[ **E8**\].WACIT’s psychosocial interventions \[ **R8a,b**\] significantly improved families’ understanding of MHD, **which reduced PTSD** \(effect size 0.79\) for **27 displaced children and their families in Kenya** \[ **E8**\]. A teacher stated: *“The parents ignored him because he was a non\-performer, but* **the parent was not aware that the child had a mental health problem. \[W\]e discussed with the parent \[and\] other teachers, giving motivation to the child. \[F\]inally the child performed very well**.*” \[ **E8**\].Children described how WACIT’s interventions changed their lives *: “I feel this is the best way I could express how I feel than talking to anyone”; “I feel like I have changed.”;* and, **“Now I am free”* \[ **E8**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Evaluations of sporting and cultural events historically focused on economic consequences. Interdisciplinary research in economics, geography and environmental planning at Cardiff led to the adoption of an event impact evaluation methodology that identifies linkages between economic and environmental impacts. The research transformed how policy\-makers, event organisers and consultants understand and evaluate event environmental impacts. It underpinned the environmental section of the ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit from UK Sport \(the UK’s high\-performance sports agency\), the widespread adoption of which led to the staging of more sustainable events in five continents. It also influenced the development and scope of the first International Sustainability Standard for Golf Tournaments, which certified major tournaments in the US, Italy, and China. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Business cases for hosting major sporting and cultural events, which often rely upon public funding, traditionally focus on economic impacts. This neglects to consider that such events can also bring significant adverse environmental impacts. To address this, an interdisciplinary Cardiff team analysed the environmental consequences of tourism consumption at major events. 

 The research, supported through Research Council \(ESRC and AHRC\) funding, highlighted the growing importance of assessing linkages between the economic and environmental consequences of event development and resulting visitor impact in event business management and planning. 

 **2.1 Combining environmental and economic assessments to evaluate sporting events** 

 There has historically been a shortage of assessment tools \(and benchmark evidence\) to evaluate the environmental impact of events. In response, the Cardiff research team integrated existing methods from geography and environmental planning with economic approaches in order to assess both the environmental and economic impacts of events **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**. Methods used included i\) Environmental Input\-Output Analysis \(ENVIO\), traditionally used to examine the economic consequences of events, but more recently expanded to take into account linked environmental effects; and ii\) Ecological Footprint \(EF\), used to assess resource use and measure its environmental impact. Collins and Flynn had previously applied the EF at a sub\-national level \(the city of Cardiff\) **\[3.4\]**. 

 In 2004, the research team was the first to use both methodologies to evaluate a major sporting event \(the FA Cup Final at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium\). This research: 

-  showed that direct and indirect environmental emissions could be estimated through the assessment of tourism spending linked to events **\[3.1\]**; 

-  identified the types of visitor spending which generated the most significant environmental impacts – particularly event\-related travel and food and drink consumption **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**; 

-  highlighted how changes to travel behaviour \(e.g. reducing air and car travel\) could significantly reduce the environmental impacts of events **\[3.2\]**. 

 The researchers recommended that this combined approach should be used in event impact evaluation as it enables practical consideration of both environmental and economic impacts **\[3.1, 3.3\]**. They further assessed and compared the economic and environmental impacts of three major sporting events – the FA Cup Final \(Cardiff, 2004\), a Six Nations rugby fixture \(Cardiff, 2006\) and the Tour de France Grand Départ \(London, 2007\). This research: 

-  identified specific policy\-amenable drivers that influence the scale of events’ environmental impacts. This includes visitor numbers, spending/consumption patterns, travel distance and mode, length of stay and event duration **\[3.5\]**; 

-  found that visitor profiles and spending patterns differed across events, resulting in varying economic and environmental impacts and a different composition of impacts; 

-  highlighted the need for future *ex ante* studies predicting event impacts to recognise the impact that different visitor types can have on spending/consumption patterns and resulting environmental consequences **\[3.2, 3.5\]**. 

 **2.2 Extending the research to assess the environmental impacts of cultural events** 

 The team extended the scope of the research to examine use of the EF as a method for assessing the environmental impacts of cultural events and festivals, as well as evaluating scenarios to reduce negative environmental impacts **\[3.6\]**. Research carried out at the Hay Literature Festival \(over 100,000 visitors\) **\[3.6\]**: 

-  found that the significant resource demands and environment impacts of festivals \(in particular visitor travel by car and air\) are comparable to major sporting events; 

-  identified that the environmental impacts of events are linked to visitor numbers, geographical location and services available in the host area \(public transport services, availability of overnight accommodation and food and drink outlets\); 

-  recommended that strategies to reduce the negative environmental impact of the festival require a more radical change in how visitors travel and an enhanced understanding of factors influencing visitor travel choices. 

 Overall, this body of research identified how event evaluations can effectively assess the environmental, as well as economic impacts of major sporting and cultural events.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Cardiff research identified how methodologies could be combined to assess the environmental, as well as economic impacts of major sporting and cultural events. Adoption of this approach nationally and internationally changed how policymakers, event organisers and consultants understand the potentially adverse environmental impacts of events. 

 This transformed impact evaluations of events and informed planning, policies and actions through: 

1.  underpinning the environmental section of UK Sport’s ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit. Since 2017, the widespread adoption of this toolkit resulted in the staging of more sustainable events in the UK and across five continents; 

1.  establishing an international best practice standard for evaluating event environmental impacts, through the Golf Environment Organisation Foundation. 

 **4.1 Transforming event impact evaluations** 

 UK Sport \(the government agency responsible for investing in Olympic and Paralympic sports in the UK\) first developed the ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit in 2008 to standardise event impact methodologies. The toolkit is run on a collaborative basis between UK Sport and partners, including: the Department of Culture, Media and Sport; Discover Northern Ireland; Event Scotland; and the Welsh Government. 

 A lack of understanding of, and appropriate tools for, evaluation in this version meant that event organisers using it were giving limited attention to the wider impacts of events. When updating the toolkit in 2016/17, Lucy Crickmore \(Major Events Consultant at UK Sport\) stated that the agency “ *wanted the event sector to go beyond economic impacts when setting objectives for their events and calculating their impacts*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 The Cardiff research team was invited to revise the environmental section of the toolkit. Crickmore stated that “ *partners specifically wanted to work with Dr. Andrea Collins and Prof. Max Munday at Cardiff University… due to their research expertise in evaluating events and their environmental impacts*” **\[5.1\]**. The Cardiff team’s redevelopment of the environment section of the toolkit and associated resources, based on **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5\]** included: 

-  the case for measuring the environmental impact of events; 

-  guidance on which environmental impacts should be considered; 

-  specific cases studies \(based on their own research\) demonstrating methodological approaches and measurement tools **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. 

 The ‘eventIMPACTS’ toolkit is now used extensively by UK Sport to enhance understanding of event environmental impacts and transform event impact evaluations. Crickmore stated that UK Sport “ *specifically uses the toolkit when making financial decisions on which events to support”* and signpost organisations to the environmental section of ‘eventIMPACTS’ “ *to determine how they might undertake their own research and a broader evaluation of environmental impacts”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Staging more sustainable sporting and cultural events** 

 Around 3,000 individuals and organisations in the UK and across Europe, Australia, South America, Asia and Africa have registered to use the transformed toolkit. In 2017, Collins and Munday collaborated with UK Sport to undertake a survey of these registered toolkit users. The 50 responses showed that ‘eventIMPACTS’ had been used to assess the economic and environmental impacts of sporting and cultural events by a wide range of organisations \(including businesses, not\-for\-profits, consultants, event organisers and governments\) across 13 countries worldwide \(England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, Serbia, Cyprus, Singapore, Australia, South Africa, and Columbia **\[5.3\]**. 

 The toolkit had informed planning decisions, policies and actions, and led to the staging of more sustainable events, as reported by users in the survey **\[5.4\].**  For example, the survey found that 47% of organisations strongly agree it enhanced their understanding of event environmental impacts and their evaluation; and 53% of organisations strongly agree it advanced their thinking about how to reduce these impacts. For example, John Coxeter\-Smith \(CEO of Sagacity Management Consultancy Services\) described ‘eventIMPACTS’ as an “ *invaluable*” resource for the Panamanian Government and Panama City Government: *We are confident, that it has at least opened Government ‘minds’ and hopefully enhanced … \[their\] understanding of the wider environmental impacts of the \[2022 Central American and Caribbean\] Games and beyond the Games, methodologies for assessing impacts and indicators they might use*” **\[5.4\]**. The Games will involve 6,000 athletes from 37 nations. 

 The survey also found that 22 organisations responding to the survey have directly used resources from the environmental section of ‘eventIMPACTS’ to inform event planning and operation decisions; and 27% have reduced the negative environmental impact of their events as a result of using the toolkit. For example, Clare Hartley \(Director of ARC Events Consultancy\) stated that the UK’s National School Games “ *found the case studies and guidance on measuring \[environmental\] impact invaluable, specifically on food and drink and reducing waste”* **\[5.5\]**. As a result, the Games *“reduced single use plastic water bottles by more than 50%, from 55,000 in 2017 to 20,000 in 2018”;* and significantly changed its branding policy; “ *Previously we spent about £120,000 on branding, last year we spent £50,000 as we reuse so much more. We have been able to reduce costs, but also reduce waste*” **\[5.5\]**. 

 The research also changed event planning decisions and reduced CO2e \(carbon dioxide equivalent\) emissions of major annual events in Wales. Between 2017 and 2019, the research team collaborated with Run4Wales, organisers of the Cardiff Half Marathon \(20,000 participants and 65,000 spectators\), and the National Eisteddfod \(45,000 visitors\) to apply the measurement tools and guidance from the environmental section of ‘eventIMPACTS’. Surveys at both events in 2017 provided new information on visitor profiles, their travel behaviour and its associated environmental impact and factors influencing travel choices. In 2018, organisers of both events used this research to inform event planning decisions and encourage more sustainable travel choices **\[5.6\]**. 

 A joint report by the research team and Run4Wales showed resulting changes to travel patterns and a 49% reduction in CO2e travel\-related emissions at the Cardiff Half Marathon **\[5.7\]**. An 18% reduction in CO2e travel\-related emissions was achieved at the National Eisteddfod **\[5.8\]**. Matt Newman, CEO of Run4Wales, stated that the underpinning research *“greatly enhanced our understanding of runner spending activities and their environmental impact*”; enabled them to be *“better equipped to minimise the environmental impact of our race catalogue*”; “ *make real progress towards staging a more sustainable race*”; and directly informed the scope of their first Environmental Policy and Green Action Plan **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.3 Environmental event impact evaluations for international golf tournaments** 

 In 2016, Cardiff research influenced the development and scope of the first International Sustainability Standard for Golf Tournaments via the Golf Environment Organisation Foundation \(GEO\) Expert Group. GEO is a not\-for\-profit that supports the international golf community to embrace sustainability. A group consisting of nine members wrote the Standard, with Collins as the sole academic representing the Cardiff research in event environmental impact evaluations **\[5.9\]**. Jonathan Smith, CEO of GEO, stated: *“your expertise and knowledge…was invaluable in developing the criteria, scope and guidance for the new Golf Tournaments International Voluntary Sustainability Standard”* **\[5.10\]**. The research informed the scope of the new Standard and was subsequently incorporated as mandatory criteria for achieving GEO® Tournament Certification **\[5.9, 5.10\]**. 

 Smith stated: “ *The Standard has changed how GEO, the golf industry and tournament organisers consider the environmental impacts of golf tournaments, specifically in relation to the scope of a tournaments carbon footprint, spectator travel and sustainable food and drink*” **\[5.10\]**. The credibility of the standard also led to the following direct strategic impacts **\[5.10\]**: 

-  it has accelerated sustainability in golf and through golf; 

-  raised awareness of the importance and need to address environmental and social sustainability at professional and amateur golf events; 

-  raised expectations within the industry to meet the Standard; 

-  accelerated sustainability commitments; 

-  elevated other tournaments to be more comprehensive by broadening their scope and deepening the delivery. 

 Since the launch of the Tournament Standard in 2017, Smith notes: “ *six major golf tournaments have achieved GEO® certification including RBC Heritage \(US, 2017\); Waste Management Phoenix Open \(US, 2017, 2018 and 2019\) \(the world’s largest golf tournament with 720,000 spectators\); the US Kids Venice Open \(Italy, 2018 and 2019\); Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational \(US, 2019\) \(with 35,000 spectators\) and the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro\-Am \(US, 2019\) \(with 150,000 spectators\) and…The Foshian Open \(China, 2019\) \- the first tournament in the Asia Pacific”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 Two further major tournaments have also committed to working towards certification, CJ Cup \(South Korea\) and AT&T Byron Nelson \(US\), and twelve tournaments \(in US, Europe, Asia and South Africa\) are using the Standard as a guide to implement sustainability **\[5.10\]**. The Standard is also directly informing the International Olympic Committee for Olympic Sports **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research in Social Work and Social Policy at the University of Stirling has identified how spaces and places can be designed to improve quality of life for people living with dementia. Because of research at Stirling, commercial and professional design practice has changed across the world to respond to the needs of people living with dementia. Care facilities are now designed and being remodelled, and public and green spaces are being adapted and used so that they support people to live better with dementia and to be socially and physically active in their communities. These impacts are across the world, in Australia, Cambodia, Canada, India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and USA, as well as throughout the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The University of Stirling is an international centre of excellence providing research and design support for both professionals and individuals seeking to improve spaces and places for people living with dementia. This case study draws on our research on design of places and spaces that has investigated homes, the objects and fixtures within them and outdoor spaces. Our research is underpinned by our ethos of engagement with people living with dementia, who are involved not only in contributing data, but also in evaluating the analysis and conclusions of the research. Our findings, recommendations, and subsequent impact thus rest on a fundamentally inclusionary approach: we have brought a social science perspective into design. 

 Dementia is an international challenge for ageing populations, with 850,000 people in the UK \(Alzheimer’s Research UK\) and 50 million world\-wide affected by the condition \(Alzheimer’s Disease International\). Spaces and places that people use can magnify or mitigate the effects of the condition and good design can enable people with dementia to live their lives more fully. Our applied research has focused on identifying, understanding, and changing design to help address the significant global challenge of dementia. 

 Our research on home and care environments \( **R1, R2, R3**\) has been externally funded by trusts including the Dementia Services Development Trust \( **R1, R2**\) and the Thomas Pocklington Trust \( **R3**\). We have carried out both critical systematic review of existing evidence and original research using interview, discussion group, and observational data from people with dementia, their carers, and service providers. 

 Our analyses of these data \( **R1, R2, R3**\) have been translated into recommended design strategies and environmental design features for use by architects, service planners, designers, and people in their own homes to promote changed professional practice. Research participants have been involved in developing the recommendations through workshops which drew both on the research synthesis \( **R2**\) and on the detailed empirical research findings \( **R1, R3**\). 

 Our research identifies evidenced innovations that help people find their way around more easily and understand their environment. The innovations can also address problems, such as behavioural difficulties and distress that unsuitable environments can cause in interaction with the condition of dementia. The research \( **R3**\) showed, for example, that sensitive use of colour and contrast in a building could enable people living with dementia to overcome visual disturbances associated both with dementia and with the ageing eye. It identified practical responses for service providers to implement such as ensuring lighting is adjusted to individual needs. The recommendations were validated through extensive consultations with people living with dementia. 

 Within the home, we have demonstrated that carefully\-designed fixtures, fittings and objects can support living better with dementia \( **R1, R2**\). We have also shown \( **R4**\) how people living with dementia and their carers use and interact with objects, using them creatively to address their own particular challenges. For example, carers adapt everyday objects to make them more usable by a person with dementia, such as by covering up buttons on a microwave. This research demonstrates the significance of personal preferences, choices, and actions in the context of seeking and providing supportive design. 

 Outside the home environment, we have studied ways to make the natural environment, including green spaces in urban settings, more accessible and friendly for people with dementia, who have been excluded from the benefits of sociable walking. Our research for Paths for All \( **R5, R6**\), a Scottish charity that exists to increase walking for everyone for health and well\-being, recommended ways of including people with dementia in walks, as well as identifying ways in which all aspects of walks – organisation, leadership, content and recruitment – could be made more dementia\-friendly. We demonstrated benefits of the walks for people living with dementia, including better health, sociability, better relationships, and enjoyment. 

 Throughout, our research supports the need for an emphasis on the ability and capacity of people with dementia, rather than disability and deficit. We involve them in research, listen to their perspectives and build understanding of how they interact with homes, objects, and open spaces.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have achieved impact on changing practice in professions, business, and building design through **training and education, consultancy, accreditation of designs and products, business development** and **activities in outside spaces**. Through these actions, we ensure our inclusionary approach is embedded in design thinking for dementia. Our national and international reputation as the ‘go\-to’ place for advice on design for dementia provides an important pathway for our research impact to achieve its reach. Media reports of newly opened and refurbished care facilities for people with dementia regularly cite the University of Stirling’s guidance in their design \(Nexis search to 31<sup>st</sup> July 2020 identifies 333 verified results, see **S1**\). Research by the University of York \(Buildings in the Making study 2019, see **S2b**\) found architects widely knowledgeable about and using our guidance \( **S2a**\). The Iris Murdoch Building \(IMB \- completed 2003\), to our knowledge the first public building worldwide to be built on dementia\-friendly design principles, houses the Dementia Services Development Centre \(DSDC\), which exists to translate research into impactful activities, and is staffed by architects, designers, and trainers. 

###  Improving professional practice through training and education 

 Our research \(e.g. **R1**\) has been used extensively in **training** qualified architects in dementia\-friendly design, mainly of care environments. Training is led by a professional architect, Lesley Palmer, who holds a knowledge exchange post in DSDC. During 2014\-2020, 446 \( **S3**\) professionals have attended the training, including architects, interior designers, construction companies, care home companies, project managers and others. This includes 116 internationally based professionals from 21 countries. They report changes to their practice in a range of contexts as a result of our training \( **S4**\). A company team leader states they are ‘using the knowledge to better inform the architects and designers I work with about the best practice when designing for dementia’ \( **S4**\). A museum developer reports ‘I was able to look at every aspect of the design and fit\-out plans in detail and make confident decisions on how to put theory into practice in our unique space’, affecting 2,500 visitors \(people living with dementia and their carers\) per year \( **S4**\). A planner in a large Northern UK local authority explained they were now making ‘towns and developments more accessible and more attractive to those living with dementia, ensuring that pedestrianisation schemes are more inclusive’ \( **S4**\). 

 Our research is regularly integrated into **practitioner education** through our Dementia Studies postgraduate programmes \(291 graduates 2014\-2020\) \( **S5a**\). Students taking these programmes generally work in dementia care, and cover a range of professions including medicine, nursing, allied health professions, care work and social work. Professionals who have completed their studies report how their practice has been enhanced: ‘\(I am\) able to effect policy matters at government level’ \(India\); ‘I was able to discover a whole new world of knowledge’ \(Canada\) \( **S5b**\). 

###  Embedding dementia friendly design through consultancy 

 We provide **consultancy** nationally and internationally \( **S6a**\): Since January 2014, we have provided input to design work for 312 clients \(including 28 outside the EU: in Australia, Cambodia, India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and the USA\). We calculate from our records of clients that the resulting designs and redesigns have benefited at least 8,000 people through design modifications to the environments in which they live, as clients have implemented the advice \( **S6a**\). Examples include working with Mediva, Japan to design the Grancreer Setagaya Nakamachi \(Tokyo\) and the Yokohama Tokaichiba Creer Residence. Both these developments include senior housing and care facilities for 75 and 91 people respectively. In Australia, we worked with Life Care Australia on its Gaynes Park Manor \( **S6b**\) development in Joslin, South Australia, which includes a 96\-bed nursing care home. This facility won a prestigious award for its architecture at the 6th Asia Pacific Eldercare Innovation Awards 2018. 

###  Driving good practice through accreditation 

 We provide care facilities and other buildings with research\-informed assessments of their **dementia\-friendliness** using our Design Audit Tool \( **S7a & S7b**\). Clients modify their buildings using our guidance and can receive our ‘Gold Award’ once they meet all the guidelines: 27 have been awarded 2014\-2020, including 3 in Japan and 1 in Australia \( **S7c**\). Our DSDC consultants were involved throughout the design and building process of the Great Sankey Neighbourhood Hub in Warrington, a community facility incorporating sports pitches, fitness studios, a swimming pool, a spa and a library. In January 2020, we accredited the Hub with a Gold Award, with the Council Leader reporting ‘Our plans for Great Sankey… place dementia\-friendliness at the heart of the facility… receiving this recognition from the University of Stirling is great news’ \( **S7d**\). 

 Using our evidence regarding the effectiveness of design features e.g. **R3**, DSDC operates a **product accreditation** scheme \( **S8a**\), whereby companies can have their products assessed for dementia friendliness. Through this process, our research evidence is directly informing the fixtures, fittings and furnishings which are used in care facilities, nationally and internationally, through its influence on commercial operations. The accreditation is done by a team in Stirling, including our architects and designers and Gibson provides embedded research expertise, drawing on his work on user choices \( **R4**\). In the REF period, 929 products and product ranges were accredited \( **S8b**\). Clients include Arjo \(a major supplier of medical equipment\), Altro, Forbo and Polyflor \(flooring\), Gradus \(interior design\), Wallgate \(washrooms and sanitaryware\) and Grayson \(clocks\), all of which are suppliers to care environments \( **S8b**\). Companies report that the accreditation supports them to advise clients on the best products to use in environments where people with dementia will be living, enhancing their commercial offering, market status and bottom line. For example, Polyflor state ‘DSDC accreditation is a further example of Polyflor as a manufacturer highlighting its commitment to the health and care sector’; and Gradus explains ‘The knowledge we have gained from DSDC has helped improve our service, recommendations and new product development process’ \( **S8b**\). 

###  Improving design through business development 

 The design principles, closely informed by our evidence appraisal \( **R3**\), have been incorporated into an app, IRIDIS \(see **S9**\) , developed in partnership with a national construction technologies innovation company, Space Group Ltd. This collaboration has generated \(2020\) a spin\-out Joint Venture **business development,** showing commercial impact. IRIDIS enables existing buildings and buildings in the process of design to be assessed for dementia\-friendly design, and suggests what modifications may be needed. Launched in 2017, IRIDIS is designed to be used, free of charge, by carers, occupational therapists and people living with dementia to optimise homes, for example by making changes to decoration, soft furnishings or floor coverings. IRIDIS has been installed 2,608 times since launch \( **S9a & S9b**\), including international users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and USA. In 2018, IRIDIS won the 'Best Collaborative' category at the Blackwood Design Awards \- an international contest held to ‘discover and champion brilliant concepts, designs and products that have the potential to help people live independently’ \( **S9c**\). IRIDIS is now developing more sophisticated applications for care professionals and architects. 

###  Supporting the use of outside spaces by setting standards 

 Our work on **outside spaces** with Paths for All \(PfA\) has delivered tangible impact for people with dementia across PfA’s whole area of operation \( **S10**\). Throughout Scotland, PfA are using a Dementia Friendly Walking Accreditation directly derived from our research as a tool to ensure good practice. To achieve accreditation, walks must demonstrate they meet criteria derived from our research including involvement of people with dementia in developing the walks, training walk leaders in dementia friendly practice, and partnering with organisations to ensure knowledge of the walks for people living with dementia. Since 2015, 31 Walking for Health projects have achieved the accreditation and are delivering over 145 Dementia Health Walks every week, supported by 579 specially trained Volunteer Walk leaders. The PfA outcome has been identified as an exemplar case study to support promotion of international standards in support for people with dementia by the ISO \(International Standards Organization\) Technical Committee for Ageing Societies, of which Robertson is a member \( **S10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Indigenous peoples suffer severely from projects funded by the World Bank. These are the most vulnerable people and their survival and identity depends directly on their physical environment. The revision of the World Bank guarantees allowed the opportunity to minimize the negative impacts of such projects. In 2015, the UK Department for International Development \(DfID\) commissioned Prof Xanthaki to review the UK position on the then draft Environmental and Social Framework \(ESF\), with the focus on its Environmental and Social Standard 7 \(ESS7\) which relates to guarantees that must be in place for the protection of indigenous peoples by the World Bank projects. Following her analysis included in 2 documents and discussed in several meetings among the author, the DfID and the FCO, the UK adopted most of the changes suggested by Prof Xanthaki, supported the more protective alternatives and ensured that the revised ESF was adopted, thereby improving the guarantees for indigenous peoples. The new standards apply to all World Bank projects from 1 October 2018 and so far have resulted in the increased protection of approximately 22,000,000 indigenous peoples on 3 continents. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the last 2 decades, Prof. Xanthaki’s work has argued in favour of stronger protection of indigenous peoples under current international law \(esp. Prof. Xanthaki’s 2007 monograph and publications on indigenous rights\). Her main argument has been that the international obligations that States have undertaken for the protection of human rights necessitate stronger protection of indigenous peoples, including consent on matters that affect them, positive measures that promote their identity and wide protection of their lands. Since the adoption of the 2007 Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Prof. Xanthaki discusses the steps that have to be taken for its implementation at the international and domestic level \(Ref.3; Ref. 4\). Her work on indigenous rights has moulded UN reports \(cited therein more than 4 times\) and has influenced both scholarship \(more than 550 citations\) and policy\-making \(e.g. in Finland, Malaysia and the UK\) at a time of positive change for indigenous rights. 

 The Bank is an international financial institution that provides investment project financing to developing countries for physical and social infrastructure projects. Its funded projects have had disastrous effects on indigenous nations, often including forced removal from their traditional lands, destruction of their traditional ways of life, and deterioration of their health, and even death. Taking into account that there are approximately 370,000,000 indigenous peoples around the world, in approximately 90 countries, usually living in lands rich in resources, and the special relationship that these peoples have with their lands, one can appreciate the importance of the guarantees that the Bank sets on the peoples affected. The new ESF was meant to address such concerns in a more effective way than the previous Bank policy on indigenous peoples, Operational Policy 4.10 \(OP 4.10\). In June 2015, the DfID commissioned Prof. Xanthaki \(then, Reader\) to solicit her expert opinion and analysis regarding the language of the then rigorously negotiated draft ESF, particularly as it related to the rights of indigenous peoples under international law.  She was asked to provide an expert opinion on: 

-  The impact of revisions that had already been made in the draft following repeated international consultation phases; 

-  Whether the draft language conformed with existing international standards; 

-  Issues that the UK government should advocate for during the subsequent round of consultations with the Bank; and 

-  Whether the UK government should ultimately endorse the current draft for further consultation. 

 Drawing on her legal analysis included in a series of outputs \(refer to specific references listed in section 3\), Prof. Xanthaki made a key recommendation for the removal of the ‘alternative approach’ embedded within the ESF which would have allowed borrowers to ‘opt\-out’ of the indigenous safeguards in Environmental and Social Standard 7 \(ESS7\), if it ‘would create a serious risk of exacerbating ethnic tension or civil strife’, as judged by the state in question. Prof. Xanthaki advised that such a provision would most certainly fall below existing international standards. In addition, Prof. Xanthaki: 

-  Criticised the application of a second, already existing broader ‘waiver’ policy that can allow the borrowing state to ignore ESS7 upon approval by the Bank’s board of directors. This included, excluding them from guarantees against their removal from their lands without their Free Prior and Informed Consent \(FPIC\) or/and rejecting their special treatment necessitated by their indigeneity. Prof. Xanthaki provided an extensive analysis of the legality and applicability of the Bank’s existing ‘waiver policy’ to the DfID and FCO. Her analysis concluded that such ‘waiver policy’ must be deleted or at least minimized to the greatest possible degree. 

  

-  Advised that FPIC was an emerging standard of international law and that any exceptions to state obligations concerning FPIC should not fall below current standards. She counselled that if FPIC was not possible, state borrowers needed to ensure that no adverse impacts result during or after the implementation of the project. 

-  Recommended that the ESF make general references to human rights standards. 

-  Recommended that the definition of ‘indigenous peoples’ in ESS7 should \(1\) remove any requirement for a distinct language or dialect and \(2\) include a criterion on non\-dominance, with a reference to exclusion and marginalisation. 

-  Advised that ESS7 should be revised to clarify that indigenous peoples affected in general \(not just those with projects on their lands\) fall within the scope of safeguards.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Several of Prof. Xanthaki’s recommendations to DfID directly influenced the position of the Secretary of State and the Executive Director to the Bank in the adoption of effective revisions and the approval of a more protective for indigenous peoples version of the ESS7 and the ESR. This resulted in significant strengthening of indigenous protection compared to the initial draft of ESR and the previous Operational Directive. These standards now apply to all Bank projects initiated after the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2018, ensuring increased protections for all indigenous peoples in all parts of the world where Bank\-financed projects are implemented. 

 <ins> **Impact on the ‘Alternative Approach’ Provision**</ins> 

 This ‘Alternative Approach Provision’, a highly disputed point at a time, allowed the potential for borrower states to opt\-out of complying with the standards applicable to indigenous peoples in their entirety and without Bank approval if it ‘would create a serious risk of exacerbating ethnic tension or civil strife.’ \(E1\) The adoption of such an approach would deprive indigenous peoples from any guarantees of their survival depending solely on the state’s narrative of the domestic situation. 

 At the time of Prof. Xanthaki’s submission to DfID, UK representatives were actively participating in the ESF consultation process and were supportive of a version of an ‘alternative approach’ provision. Prof. Xanthaki’s strong opposition to such an approach influenced a change of the UK position. The revised UK position was *verbatim* the recommendation made by Xanthaki as also confirmed in correspondence \(DfID\) to Prof. Xanthaki, wherein they thanked Xanthaki ‘ *for \[her\] very helpful comments on the Framework*’ \(E10\). 

 As a result of Prof. Xanthaki’s research and recommendations, the DfID and FCO put forward a revised position on the ‘alternative approach’ to the UK Secretary of State, who also concurred that the language should be removed. This was again confirmed in correspondence from DfID to Prof. Xanthaki \(E10\). It is also evidenced by the UK Statement on the World Bank Safeguards Review \(UK Statement\) wherein the UK government stated that it ‘ *welcome\[d\] the progress made in the second draft of the revised \[ESF\],*’ and that they ‘ *support the changes in the new draft ESS7 for protecting Indigenous Peoples in line with international practice*.’ \(E2\).  The second draft of the ESF did not include the ‘alternative approach’ revision.  The UK government further commented that it welcomed the ‘ *strengthening of the \[ESF\] with regards to protections for vulnerable and marginalised groups*.’ \(E2\). Although the idea of an ‘opt\-out’ remained an issue in subsequent rounds of consultation, the final version of the ESF adopted by the Bank did not include the offending provision \(E2\). 

 <ins> **Impact on Human Rights Language**</ins> 

 Prof. Xanthaki’s reports also recommended that the Bank include additional human rights language in the ESF to increase the guarantees on indigenous peoples’ rights, including women and children. The UK final statements aligned with Prof. Xanthaki’s position \(E2\). The final version of the ESF adopted by the Bank did in fact introduce additional human rights language through references to the principle of non\-discrimination and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights \(E3\). 

 <ins> **Impact on the beneficiaries of the ESR protection**</ins> 

 Prof. Xanthaki’s reports also recommended that the definition of indigenous peoples in the ESF include a reference to ‘exclusion’ or ‘marginalization’, as more empowering language. The previously used term ‘disadvantaged’ corroborated in the portraying of indigenous peoples as victims. The UK approved of the final version of the ESF which replaced the term ‘disadvantaged’ with the term ‘marginalized’ in referencing what Indigenous Peoples may be called in disparate contexts \(E3\). 

 <ins> **Bank Executive Director Approval**</ins> 

 As a founding member of the Bank and a major shareholder, the UK position on ESR guarantees was of great significance. This is because the UK holds a disproportionate block of voting shares in the Bank’s institutions compared to the majority of other states, hence its support of the final draft was paramount in order for it to pass. Subsequently, the Bank’s Executive Directors adopted the ESF by consensus on 4<sup>th</sup> of September 2016. \(E4\). 

  

 <ins> **Subsequent impact on safeguarding indigenous peoples**</ins> 

 Since the 1<sup>st</sup> October 2018, the rights of approximately 370,000,000 indigenous peoples are better guaranteed. This is because after the Bank began applying the newly\-adopted ESF to all new Bank projects. No state can withhold the guarantees of the ESF ESS7 on indigenous peoples randomly on the mere basis of its subjective judgment. This is a major milestone for the survival and protection of basic rights of indigenous peoples. A number of proposed Bank projects in the concept or appraisal stage of the Bank’s project life cycle are currently being designed *in accordance with ESS7*. These include, but are not limited to the following projects: 

  

-  Tanzania’s Productive Social Safety Net Phase II \(PSSN II\) project, which aims to help extremely poor households move into sustainable livelihoods through increased access to health, education and resources. Contrary to a 2016 Bank project in Tanzania, where Tanzania was able to opt out of the previous indigenous peoples policy with disastrous effects on indigenous nations \(E6\), now the project’s Vulnerable Groups Planning Framework includes guarantees such as indigenous ability to *‘participate in, and benefit from the development process in ways that do not threaten their unique cultural identities and wellbeing.’* \(E5\). Approximately 466,700 indigenous peoples live currently in Tanzania \(source: Minority Rights Group\). 

-  The Productive Alliances Project in Paraguay \(P168153\), an agricultural project aimed at creating long\-term economic opportunities for the rural poor and vulnerable, specifically includes a discussion on the applicability of ESS7 to the project. \(E7\). The bank’s documents identify approximately 116,000 indigenous peoples in Paraguay \(source: Project Information Document\). 

-  China’s Renewable Energy and Battery Storage Promotion Project which will be deploying battery storage systems and renewable technology applications across the country, including indigenous areas, also discusses ESS7 and in particular the need of loan applicants to obtain the FPIC of indigenous peoples \(called ethnic minorities\) \(E8\).  More than 21,000,000 indigenous peoples live in China and as the project will have wide coverage, many of them will be affected \(source: Minority Rights group\) 

-  The Transforming the Mekong Delta GCF Program for Vietnam project is an agricultural development project in the upper provinces of Vietnam’s Mekong Delta. An initial screening indicated that the project activities will take place in areas where ethnic minority groups reside. In light of this, the project’s Environmental and Social Review Summary confirmed that an ethnic minority framework would be prepared describing the provisions and procedures for implementing ESS7 \(E9\). Around 500,000 indigenous peoples live in Vietnam \(source: Minority Rights Group\).

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Enteral tubes \(ET\) bypassing the mouth are utilized where patients are unable to swallow. ETs are used to deliver food and drink directly into the intestines and can also be used to administer medication. However, most therapeutics are not formulated for ET delivery, and it is therefore often necessary to manipulate medicines \(e.g. crush tablets\) to enable medicines to be passed through an ET. Such practice voids the safe drug use licence and results in the unlicensed administration of medicines. 

 UEA research has highlighted that people with ETs are at very high risk of medication error due to the need to manipulate medicines prior to administration. This research led to **Professor** **David** **Wright** advising \(in 2014\) the Medicines & Health Regulatory Agency on licensing processes and a subsequent revision to its licensing standards. 

 In collaboration with Rosemont Pharmaceuticals, this research led to the development and licencing of thirteen new liquid drug formulations for ET administration across the UK, which have supported Rosemont Pharmaceuticals sales to grow by 230% \(from GBP18,0000,000 to GBP42,000,000\) between 2004 and 2019. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 Swallowing difficulties \(dysphagia\) arises from numerous medical conditions associated with ageing e.g., Parkinson’s disease, dementia and stroke. Different grades of clinical dysphagia affect more than 1 in 6 people over the age of 65. This inability to swallow results in a significant proportion of this population receiving their food and medicines via ETs. Within hospitals, ETs are also used when patients are unconscious and unable to receive food and liquids by mouth. For these patients the formulation of the drug in a liquid form is as important as the medication itself \( **3.1, 3.2**\). 

 Research by **Professor David Wright’s** research group in the School of Pharmacy at UEA has highlighted that whilst healthcare professionals focussed their attention on nutrition and hydration, appropriate and safe administration of medicines was often overlooked. The research identified that when nurses were required to administer medicines via enteral tubes, the standard practice was to either disperse tablets and capsules in water or administer a liquid medicine prior to administration \( **3.3, 3.4**\). Such practices were performed outside of the medicine’s license and were associated with significant increases in risk in medication error and with the potential for increased risk of ET blockage, which can necessitate new tube insertion by surgical procedure. Furthermore, due to the wide range of options available when choosing to undertake unlicensed administration, the process was found to vary significantly depending on the administrator \( **3.2, 3.5**\). 

 UEA research specifically identified that administration of medicines to patients with dysphagia was not optimal \( **3.2, 3.3**\). Several factors conspired here, including inadequate knowledge of how to administer medicines, and lack of skill in mixing medicines for ET delivery \( **3.3, 3.4**\). This research highlighted that, excluding time errors, the normalised frequency of medicine administration errors for patients with dysphagia was 21.1% compared with 5.9% for patients without \( **3.3**\). Furthermore, the results highlighted that there was a significantly increased risk of medication errors \(P < 0.001\) for patients with dysphagia \(excluding patients with enteral tubes\). In dysphagia patients with enteral tubes, there was a further increase in the risk of medication error \(P < 0.001\) \( **3.3**\). 

 The main concerns with respect to administration of medicines via ETs were found to be tube blockage and loss of active ingredient on the tube during administration. The research identified that the principal reason for these outcomes was the limited availability of licensed medicines suitable for administration via ETs \( **3.2**\) **.** A key recommendation of the research was to administer drugs in formulations that are specifically designed not to block ETs in an unaltered state. These recommendations would decrease the risk of errors and, furthermore, the possibility of additional \(avoidable\) surgical procedures would be significantly reduced. 

 Key conclusions of the UEA research are that improvements in interprofessional communication are needed to improve medicine administration to dysphagic patients, and that there is a need for continuing professional development in medicine administration to provide greater understanding of the contra\-indications of combining medications and of the significant legal implications of altering formulations.

 4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Effecting safer drug administration</ins> <ins>to patients**</ins> 

 Nurses, midwives and health visitors are advised not to crush medication. However, there are occasions where a patient is unable to swallow solid oral dosage forms. In such instances, it may be necessary to crush tablets or open capsules. Crushing medication or opening capsules prior to administration results in unlicensed administration. Under the Human Medicines Regulations \(2012\) only licensed prescribers can authorise the administration of unlicensed medicines. It may therefore be illegal for other healthcare professionals \(HCP\) to open a capsule or crush a tablet before administration without the authorisation of the prescriber. Where such administration results in harm to the patient, then the manufacturer has no liability for any harm that ensues, and if the unlicensed administration is unauthorised by the prescribing doctor then liability may lie solely with the administering HCP. 

 In 2019, **Wright** chaired a national working party to develop clinical guidelines for use by healthcare professionals when administering medicines via ETs \( **Source** **5.1**\). In line with Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency \(MHRA\) recommendations, these guidelines state: 

 “*When choosing a new drug, follow due diligence and use clinical judgement: – medicines licensed for administration by enteral feeding tube should be used first line.*” 

 \( **Source** **5.1** **page 4**\) 

 Chief Pharmacists from NHS hospital trusts have confirmed that this is being implemented in contemporary NHS practice: 

 *“Best practice and advice from the MHRA dictates that we always use a licensed product where one exists… Given the option of a licensed versus unlicensed product, professional standards and responsibilities for quality assurance will always guide us to use the licensed one, even if there is a cost implication. Having a licensed liquid available to us gives assurance that it can be administered safely via an enteral tube”* 

 *“It is always preferable to use a licensed liquid preparation, if this is available. The reasons for this are that the licensed preparation will be on the commercial market and are therefore readily available at short notice. Licensed medicinal products will also have been tested to ensure that it is a standardised preparation that is clearly labelled and will reliably deliver the stated dose within the shelf life of the product.”* 

 \( **Source 5.2**\) 

 In 2013, **Wright** secured funding from Rosemont Pharmaceuticals to develop education and training materials which supported the relaunch of the  [swallowingdifficulties.com](http://www.swallowingdifficulties.com/) website. This is an online go\-to for patients and HCP to obtain information and guidance on dysphagia and liquid medicines. The website has received over 1 million international webpage views \(with users split equally across the EU, USA and Asia with smaller percentages from Africa and Oceania\). Information specifically for patients is accessed 40% of the time, with 20% information for prescribers. \( **Source** **5.3**\) 

 The education grants also facilitated the development and delivery of a massive open on\-line course \(MOOC\) entitled “Dysphagia: Swallowing Difficulties and Medicines”. The MOOC seeks to disseminate best clinical practice to patients, carers and healthcare professionals administering medicines to people with dysphagia. The MOOC is delivered over five weeks and has been accessed by over 30,000 patients and healthcare professionals from 181 countries and dependencies. \( **Source** **5.4**\) 

 <ins> **Developing</ins> <ins>the first licensed liquid medicine</ins><ins>s</ins> <ins>for ET administration**</ins> 

 UEA researchers collaborated with the senior management team at Rosemont Pharmaceuticals – a specialist company that manufactures and sells liquid medicines globally – on a strategy to license specific liquid medicines for ET administration. 

 “*In 2005 we invited Prof Wright to present his findings at a Rosemont round table event, at which he recommended the company to consider licensing liquids specifically for administration via enteral tubes \- at the time no liquid medicines were approved for this route of administration.*"" \( **Source 5.5**\). 

 In order to deliver this business plan, senior regulatory team members from Rosemont, with **Wright** as an expert witness, were invited to MHRA in 2014 to discuss and agree a new process for the licensing of liquid medicines for administration via the ET route \( **Source 5.6**\). Research undertaken by Wright \( **3.6**\) was used to underpin and inform the methods used by Rosemont to secure their ET administration licenses \( **Source 5.6**\). 

 “*The work originally done by Rebecca White who was Prof Wright’s PhD student investigating how to set up the testing rig and advice on the types of tubing and materials, plus techniques used to administer drugs via feeding tubes helped Rosemont develop a sound method of testing, that gave robust and repeatable results*.” 

 \( **Source 5.6**\) 

 Importantly, the research undertaken in the **Wright\-Rosemont** collaboration contributed to the MHRA benchmark used when considering license approval of other liquid medicines for ET approval that are submitted by other companies. 

 *“As a result of the discussion, the MHRA was confident that the proposed approach would not only provide an appropriate way of testing to allow assessment by the regulatory authorities, but would also set the bar for the testing that would be required for all marketing authorisations, requiring that route of administration.”* 

 \( **Source 5.6**\) 

 Having secured MHRA agreement for the proposal, Rosemont were the first company to apply for, and secure, UK licencing approval to market and supply liquid medicines for ET administration to dysphagia patients. Rosemont currently has thirteen licensed liquid medicines including seven drugs at different doses that embrace a broad range of therapeutics used to treat many of the most common diseases, ranging from high blood pressure and infections to epilepsy and pain. 

 As the UK’s largest specialist liquid medicine manufacturer, Rosemont used the licenses for these new products to maintain its market share **\(Source 5.5\)**. According to Rosemont, specific licensing for ETs: 

 *“...has allowed us to retain customers and reduce the severe price erosion, because we have added something clinically useful to these products.”* \( **Source 5.5**\) 

 The importance of **Wright**’s research to Rosemont’s development of licensed liquid medicines is recognised by the company 

 *“…Prof Wright played a pivotal role in Rosemont’s decision to be the first company to develop and license formulations for enteral tube administration. Our work with prof. Wright since 2004 has provided a solid platform for Rosemont to drive product sales and disseminate clinical best practice in medicines administration to patients with dysphagia. In this time period, the sales of Rosemont liquid medicines have more than doubled from £18m to £42m, representing a significant increase in our company turnover”* \( **Source 5.5**\). 

 There is evidence of other companies licensing their medicines for administration via the ET route in recent years. For example, Colonis Pharma, Bayer, and other pharmaceutical manufacturers have secured UK licensing for ET administration of their products. In 2018, ITF Pharma secured FDA approval for ET administration of riluzole in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the United States \( **Source 5.7**\). 

 <ins> **Improving healthcare outcomes with mitigated risks, legal challenge and cost**</ins> 

 Unlicensed administration of crushed tables or capsule powders via ETs can cause drug delivery to inappropriate sites for drug absorption \(stomach vs lower intestine\) and unintended drug interactions, for example, between different drugs, between drug and feeds or between the drug and tube \( **3.1\-3.5**\). The development of new licenced products, applicable to a broad spectrum of symptoms/conditions, is ensuring that these medicines are being delivered with optimal efficacy, and thus realising their full therapeutic potential. 

 Crushed tablets can cause ETs to block \( **3.1\-3.5**\). The availability of ET\-specific formulations, developed through the **Wright\-Rosemont** collaboration, obviate these blockages. Avoiding ET blockage removes surgical \(and post\-surgery infection\) risks and reduces hospital costs associated with clinical management of tube blockage and reinsertion. 

 In summary, increased availability of medicines licensed for administration via ET simplifies practitioner decision\-making, reduces the opportunity for error in the preparation of unlicensed medicines through e.g. tablet crushing and removes the possibility of legal challenge. Thus, the development, licencing and increased availability of ET\-specific formulations are improving patient care and protecting thousands of nurses, midwives and health visitors from potential legal action.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Sonnino’s applied research on food systems shaped and established the first global policy framework for research and intervention on sustainable urban food. The research underpins the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation’s \(UN FAO\) ‘Framework for the Urban Food Agenda’ \(a strategic document defining urban food systems as a new area of intervention and investment\), which raised $20M from donor\-countries to support technical work on food and cities across eight countries. The research also informed the development and execution of a new €49M research and innovation agenda on urban food systems for the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme across 28 member states. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over half the world’s population lives in urban areas and this figure is expected to rise to 70% by 2050. Already urban dwellers consume up to 70% of available food supply, even in countries with large rural populations, and rapid urbanisation is increasingly threatening global food security and the ability of communities to have access to adequate food. Sonnino’s interdisciplinary approach combines research on short supply chains, public procurement, food security and food governance to tackle this global issue. 

 Building on the findings of an ESRC project on school meals \(2005\-2008\) that highlighted the potential of city governments to reform food system dynamics **\[G3.1, 3.1\]**, in 2009 Sonnino proposed a new research and policy agenda on urban food, highlighting the role of cities as food system actors **\[3.2\]** – that is, the cities’ potential to transform food systems through the use of policy tools that include far more than just urban agriculture. This article and underpinning research on the need to include urban, alongside rural, areas in food debates **\[G3.1, 3.2\]** provided the basis for two large projects funded by the European Commission, which have been instrumental in shaping a new urban food agenda **\[G3.2, G3.3\]**. 

 Outputs from these  projects \(which saw Cardiff University lead work packages on urban food\) include publications highlighting the importance of urban food governance and policy to deliver sustainable food security, pointing in particular to the relevance of policy instruments such as public procurement **\[3.3\]**, short supply chains **\[3.4\]** and land use planning in facilitating a holistic reform of urban food systems **\[3.5\]**. 

 This work positioned Sonnino at the forefront of an emerging scientific agenda tackling urban food challenges. Since 2014, the research has been widely shared through invited presentations \(in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Bulgaria, Belgium, Romania and the UK\) by global networks and policy organisations, and keynote speeches at major policy events \(2015 Signing Ceremony of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, 2016 Mayors’ Summit at UN FAO headquarters and 2018 Zero Hunger event organised by the EC and UN FAO at the European Parliament\). 

 In 2016, Sonnino was the only academic invited as an expert advisor on the EU\-funded project ‘Innovation for a Sustainable and Healthy Production, Delivery and Consumption of Food in Cities’ – coordinated by EUROCITIES \(a network of government representatives from more than 130 of Europe's largest cities\) **\[G3.4\]**. Over nine months, Sonnino’s scientific advice to a team of practitioners from EUROCITIES and the City of Milan helped them collect and analyse data from cities all over the world that were committed to reforming their food systems. The project recognised the important role of research and innovation funding in supporting the development of urban food systems, and made recommendations for the ways in which future funding in this area should be set up, including better coordination between different sources. This would help cities to rise to the challenges posed by food security **\[3.6\]**. 

 Findings from the EUROCITIES project highlighted four emerging areas of innovation: 

-  **systems thinking** – the capacity by city governments to understand \(and engage with\) food as a complex system **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]**; 

-  **enhanced civil society participation in food governance** – a conscious effort by city governments to create more inclusive and democratic food governance arenas **\[3.3, 3.4\]**; 

-  **food policy integration** – the inclusion of food within other policy sectors and priorities \(e.g. housing, transport, welfare, environment\) **\[3.3\]**; 

-  **progressive trans\-local alliances between cities** – the emergence of global networks of cities that facilitate knowledge\-exchange and dissemination of best practice around food **\[3.5\]**. 

 The research also highlighted barriers faced by city governments while striving to reform their food systems, pointing in particular to their inability to understand and address social and environmental challenges that cut across multiple levels of governance **\[3.5\]**. 

 These insights were very well received by the EU’s Directorate General for Research and Innovation and by UN FAO; both offered an expert contract to Sonnino to shape and guide their work in the new field of urban food policy and planning.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Sonnino’s research influenced a new strategic approach for the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation \(UN FAO\) and a new research and innovation agenda for the European Commission. This played a key role in supporting the development and implementation of innovative approaches to help local governments ensure that their food systems are inclusive and sustainable. 

 **4.1 Implementing a new UN strategic approach to food security and urban planning** 

 Sonnino’s research ensured that UN FAO’s strategic approach to the challenges of urban food security could be resourced, developed and implemented globally. In 2017, she was awarded an expert contract \($28,000\) from UN FAO, following an internal analysis to identify *“a good leader who could influence and guide what the FAO could do...across regions of the world”* **\[5.1\]**. Sonnino was chosen for her *“prestige as researcher”* and *“her relevant work on key issues of urban food security”* **\[5.1\]**. For 18 months \(2017\-18\), she led on writing the ‘Framework for the Urban Food Agenda’ – a high\-level guide supporting local and national governments in tackling the complex food challenges created by urbanisation. Internal support was provided from all divisions of the organisation, but no other external expert was involved. 

 FAO’s Strategic Programme Advisor and lead technical contributor to the Framework acknowledged the contribution of Sonnino’s work: *“The Framework uses much of Professor Sonnino’s research and it is specifically informed by three areas of her expertise: public food procurement, short food supply chains and systems planning/thinking”* **\[5.1\]**. The FAO Framework was launched in 2019 and translated into six languages. Through its overarching aims and its seven Comprehensive Areas of Support \(CAS\) designed to target UN intervention, the Framework provides pathways and funding to support local governments in their efforts to address urban food security and develop sustainable food systems **\[5.2, 5.3\]**. 

 The Framework signalled a change in thinking within the organisation. Karen Fabbri \(Deputy Head of the Directorate General for Research and Innovation at the European Commission\) confirms: *“her \[Sonnino’s\] ground\-breaking work with the Food and Agriculture Organisation…has played a substantial role in establishing sustainable urban food systems on the global policy agenda”* **\[5.4, 5.3\]**. In particular, the Framework’s whole\-systems approach commits UN FAO to support food system actors \(e.g. traders, wholesalers, processors, street vendors\) that were not often direct beneficiaries of policy intervention by the United Nations **\[5.1\]**. In addition to ensuring a cohesive approach to urban food systems, this approach facilitates inclusion and access to support for some of the most vulnerable individuals and small businesses. FAO’s Strategic Programme Advisor stated: *“I enthusiastically and strongly support a positive assessment of the impact of the work Roberta has produced in the last few years, which, given her involvement in the urban food work FAO, can be considered as unprecedented”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 By the end of 2019, the seven CAS had attracted $20M in funding from donor countries. UN FAO is investing these funds to facilitate the development of urban food systems in Tunisia, Bangladesh, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, Costa Rica, Ukraine and Tanzania. FAO’s Strategic Programme Advisor highlights the importance of the Framework in FAO’s flagship Urban Food Systems Programme in Peru, where *“the Framework is being used constantly and with implementation of the CAS across the national territory”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Take\-up of Sonnino’s research, via the Framework’s integral role in the future development of UN policy, is demonstrated by how the Framework’s key principles are embedded in the UN’s thinking on urban food systems. UN staff training on its key principles took place at two regional offices, at the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact’s annual Mayors’ gathering in France, at the 2020 World Urban Forum in Abu Dhabi and was planned at four regional offices by end of 2020 **\[5.5\]**. The legacy of Sonnino’s systemic approach also continues to influence FAO policy\-making by *“inspiring other processes in FAO’s teams that were struggling to complete holistic documents”* **\[5.1\]**. For example, it is informing an entire section of the FAO’s business portfolio, which includes six sub\-programmes on urban food action **\[5.1\]**. The impact of Sonnino’s work on the activities of UN FAO continues to unfold through her involvement in a new stream of work designed to strengthen the links between national and local governments for more effective intervention on global food security **\[5.1, 5.6\]**. 

 **4.2 Identifying and implementing a new urban food agenda for the European Commission** 

 Sonnino’s research, particularly from the EUROCITIES project, was translated into policy briefings for the European Commission **\[5.7\]**, and led to an invitation to join DG Research FOOD 2030’s Expert Group, tasked with identifying a new research and innovation agenda for the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme. Sonnino was Vice\-Chair of the Expert Group, comprised of 12 academics from across Europe, representing a range of different fields and disciplines. Karen Fabbri, Deputy Head of the Directorate General for Research and Innovation, confirmed: *“Roberta’s influence within the group and on its outcomes were important as she was the only academic advocating for the inclusion of urban food systems in the EU Research Framework programme”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 Sonnino led on drafting the final report, which identifies urban food systems as a priority funding area for the next round of European research. Fabbri stated that Sonnino’s research *“on enhanced civil society participation in food governance, food policy integration, and systems thinking meant that she provided a unique and valuable contribution to the discussions and outputs from the work”* **\[5.4\]**. These findings are present in the final FOOD 2030 report, which directly cites Sonnino when stating that public actors are developing an interest in food, nutrition and landscapes “given their contributions to healthy lifestyle, urban design and the quality of the retailing, green infrastructure and mobility systems in an urban area ” **\[5.8**, p.20 **\]**. 

 The FOOD 2030 report also led to the European Commission releasing two new funding calls under the existing Framework Programme \(Horizon 2020\) **\[5.9\]**. Fabbri noted that these are already fostering alliances within and between cities, as well as *“supporting networks of cities to share best practices on sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 The inaugural EC call for projects on citizen\-driven food systems was launched in 2018 **\[5.9\]** and *“findings from Roberta’s close collaboration with EUROCITIES were very influential in framing the scope and content of the call”* **\[5.4\]**. The call states that the impact of the funded projects should be to support **\[5.9\]**: 

-  intensified interactions between all actors in the food chain; 

-  increased participatory and citizen science initiatives in the area of food and nutrition security in cities. 

 The call allocated funding for a total of €15M for two projects, which will take place over 13 countries \(Italy, Denmark, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Slovenia, Netherlands, UK, Poland, Sweden, Romania and Greece\) between 2020 and 2023 **\[5.9\]**. 

 Through an additional investment of €34M, a second funding call was launched in June 2019 to support the development of urban food policies across all 28 European member states. Fabbri stated that the call also echoes Sonnino’s work through: 

-  an emphasis on participatory planning; 

-  the need for urban governments to co\-design \(with local stakeholders\) more systemic food strategies, with funds used to support *“development of sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems policies in city\-regions, where system thinking, institutional innovation and participatory planning are at the core”* **\[5.4, 5.9\]**. 

 Three projects were awarded in May 2020, including the €12M ‘Building Pathways Toward FOOD 2030\-led Urban Food Policies’ \(FOODTRAILS\) project. Led by the City of Milan, the project has 19 partners, including Cardiff University \(with Sonnino as overall scientific coordinator for the project\), civil society organisations and an innovation agency. FOODTRAILS co\-designs and co\-implements sustainable urban food policies in 11 partner cities across nine European countries \(Italy, France, UK, Denmark, Albania, Portugal, Greece, Poland and the Netherlands\), as well as in 21 other cities in 13 countries beyond Europe \(including Russia, the USA, Brazil, China, Australia and South Africa\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The okapi \(a relative of the giraffe\) is under considerable threat, yet little was known about its evolutionary history and biogeography. Cardiff research demonstrated that wild okapis have greater genetic diversity and geographic subdivision than previously suspected. Discovery of okapis south of the Congo river resulted in the establishment of a new National Park \(Lomami\) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, supporting greater species protection. The research also led to new okapi conservation strategies, including transformation of the captive breeding programme in Europe, and evidencing the urgent need for the okapi threat status to be upgraded from ‘Near Threatened’ to ‘Endangered’. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Okapis \( *Okapia johnstoni*\) are shy, solitary creatures that inhabit remote forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo \(DR Congo\). They are important locally, where they are considered sacred, and globally, with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) designating them a *flagship species* \(i.e., a threatened species that can drive conservation efforts that benefit other species\). Despite this, the okapi is under considerable threat, both indirectly \(from industries like mining\) and directly \(in 2012 a militia attack on the Okapi Wildlife Reserve Headquarters in the DR Congo resulted in loss of all captive okapis, alongside seven rangers\). Establishing population numbers and indicators of species resilience, such as genetic diversity, has been challenging, impacting on the development of successful strategies to protect the species. To address this issue, Cardiff research studied the genetic diversity of the okapi in DR Congo, and also in captive populations. 

 **2.1 Applying genetic tools to study the genetic diversity & geographic range of okapis** 

 To assess the diversity in wild okapi populations, Bruford and Stanton \(initially Bruford’s PhD student; subsequently research associate from May 2015\) established a collaboration with White Oaks Conservation Centre \(USA\), who were dealing with breeding issues in their captive okapi population. Using blood samples from captive okapis at the Centre, alongside samples from wild individuals, Bruford constructed the first genomic library for the okapi, describing 13 polymorphic microsatellite loci that could be used to measure okapi genetic diversity **\[3.1\]**. 

 The Cardiff team subsequently identified key research priorities for okapi in the DR Congo Basin region, including sampling gaps in relevant taxonomic groups across multiple species **\[3.2\]**. During 2010\-2013, the Cardiff team joined the DR Congo TL2 project, which surveyed the activity of large mammals and humans in the Tshuapa\-Lomami\-Lualaba Conservation Landscape \(TL2\), a 40,000 km<sup>2</sup> unexplored area of Congolese forest bordered by the Tshuapa, Lomami, and Lualaba Rivers. This area was thought to be far outside the traditional known range of okapis. The research involved collection and genetic analysis of dung samples to identify the presence of animals living in this new forest zone. 

 Importantly, faecal samples collected during the TL2 expedition yielded positive evidence for the existence of okapis south of the Congo river for the first time **\[3.3\]**. While some museum specimens collected in the 19th century possessed labelling that implied animals from this region, this had never been independently corroborated, and the population was suspected to be extinct. Bruford also demonstrated that okapis possessed equivalent evolutionary richness to its closest relative, the giraffe, across its entire sub\-Saharan range, illustrating its importance as the only close relative to the giraffe **\[3.4\]**. 

 The field research also demonstrated limited dispersal of okapis from the area in which they were born, helping Bruford to estimate a geographic range for the okapis based on confirmed genetic locations across DR Congo **\[3.5\]**. Additional research found that the European and US captive breeding population had retained a very limited portion of the species’ range\-wide genetic diversity. This presented a high risk of inbreeding depression in breeding programmes, without careful genetic management of the species in captivity **\[3.6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Cardiff team are members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Giraffe and Okapi Special Interest Group. In May 2013, under the auspices of this newly formed group, key stakeholders including the Institut Congolaise pour la Conservation de la Nature \(ICCN, a Congolese government department\) and the Zoological Society of London, met in Kisangani to discuss future approaches to okapi conservation. Presentation of Cardiff’s research findings at this meeting delivered new conservation impacts as follows: \(1\) establishment of a new national park in DR Congo, designed to protect the newly discovered okapi population in the South West; \(2\) improved strategies for genetic management of captive okapi breeding; and \(3\) upgrading of the okapi conservation status to ‘Endangered’, as well as development of the first ten\-year okapi conservation strategy. 

  1.  **Establishment of the Lomami National Park in DR Congo** 

 As part of the DR Congo TL2 project, the discovery of okapis south of the Congo river **\[3.3\]**, transformed understanding of the geographical extent of the species. The map below **\[**from **3.3\]** shows where the Cardiff team identified okapi dung in their studies \(small grey circles\). As well as dung present in the already protected Okapi Faunal Reserve, okapis were clearly active south of the Congo River adjacent to the Lomami River. 

 Stuart Nixon, Africa Field Programme Coordinator \(Chester Zoo\) and Co\-Chair of the IUCN Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group, explained that Cardiff research “ *unequivocally confirmed the presence of the okapi in the Lomami basin of central DRC\-­‐ a significant range extension”* **\[5.1\]** *.* 



 The Cardiff discovery led to the establishment of Lomami National Park in 2016 by the DR Congo Government, the first national park to be created in the area for over 40 years **\[5.1\]**, covering 5.4 million hectares \(shaded grey area at the bottom of the diagram\). This new Park aimed to bolster conservation of the okapi population south of the Congo river, but also granted protection to other critical species, including forest elephants, bonobo, the recently discovered Congo peafowl \( *Afroparvus congensis*, the only African representative of the peafowl\) and a previously unknown primate, the lesula **\[5.1, 5.2, 5.3\]**. 

 Notably, Lomami National Park is the first Congolese protected area to be set up in a participatory manner, facilitated by the TL2 project and Institut Congolaise pour la Conservation de la Nature. Conservationists and government officials work directly with local communities within and around the park to ensure protection of the region and promote sustainable livelihoods, such as recruitment as local park guides **\[5.2, 5.3\]**.  John Hart, from the Frankfurt Zoological Society \(an NGO operating in the Lomami National Park\), noted *“the willingness of this community to collaborate with Congolese national park authorities and TL2 project staff in protecting the buffer zone, and in particular their okapi”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 Nixon noted the critical importance of Cardiff research in this new conservation initiative: “ *This discovery \[of okapi in the region\] provided important evidence used in the 2016 creation of the 8,900km<sup>2</sup> Parc National de la Lomami, DRC’s first new national park for over 40 years”* **\[5.1\]**. He further states that the Cardiff research showing the unique genetic diversity of the Lomami population *“carried additional conservation significance”* which was *“also a potentially valuable piece of information for additional conservation prioritisation such as the IUCN's Key Biodiversity Areas initiative*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.2 Improved management of the captive population** 

 Captive breeding programmes are vital to the survival of endangered species. Cardiff research showed that, while captive okapi breeding programmes had been relatively effective at preventing inbreeding, substantial genetic diversity had been lost **\[3.3, 3.4\]**. Through the provision of Cardiff genetic tools and research, including analysis of microsatellite loci and novel insights into biodiversity in wild **\[3.1\]** and captive **\[3.3\]** okapi populations, Bruford improved the ability of European and US captive breeding programmes to make breeding selections that maximised genetic diversity and long\-term species viability. 

 The Okapi International Studbook Keeper \(an international record kept by Antwerp Zoo with genetic information on every okapi that has ever lived in a zoo\) confirmed that Cardiff research **\[3.3\]** “ *allowed us to examine the genetic diversity of the captive population, compare with the wild population and additional captive populations”* **\[5.4\]**. The research transformed the captive breeding programme in Europe, in collaboration with Antwerp Zoo \(KMDA\) and the European breeding program \(EAAP\). Antwerp Zoo confirmed that the new insights would “ *result in a revised genetic management strategy for the ex situ populations*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 They further noted that “ *these new insights…\[are\] guiding the breeding programme and including more efficient exchange of individuals between Europe and the US – a strategy recommended in the recent IUCN species assessment, which followed from the publication* **\[3.6\]**” **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.3 Change in conservation status and creation of conservation strategy** 

 The joint meeting in Kisangani in May 2013, when the Cardiff research findings were presented, led to two further critical positive impacts on okapi conservation: a change in the IUCN conservation status of the okapi, and publication of the first ever okapi conservation strategy. 

 **a. From ‘Near Threatened’ to ‘Endangered’** 

 In November 2013, the IUCN changed the conservation status of the okapi from ‘Near Threatened’ to ‘Endangered’ **\[5.5\]**. Notably, the change to ‘Endangered’ grants access to funding sources for conservation, such as the People’s Trust for Endangered Species, the US Government’s Critically Endangered Animals Conservation Fund, and the UN’s Global Wildlife Program. Based on the okapi status change, a successful application was made to the IUCN Save Our Species fund by local conservation organisations including Institut Congolaise pour la Conservation de la Nature, for a project combating threats to okapi and African forest elephants in DR Congo **\[5.6\]**. 

 **b. A new international strategy for the protection of the okapi** 

 In 2015, the IUCN published the first ever okapi conservation strategy and status review **\[5.7\]**. Co\-written by the Cardiff team, the document drew strongly on Cardiff research, and cited Cardiff\-led studies **\[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]** over 30 times. The ten\-year strategy calls for urgent government and international commitment to ensure that key Congolese conservation areas are protected from armed militia and illegal activities **\[5.8\]**. This document is the first\-ever coordinated global strategy to protect the okapi **\[5.5, 5.9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr. Stephen Hills’ research has improved the outcomes of and justified the national rollout \(or closure\) of London\-based sport\-for\-development \(S4D\) interventions tackling unemployment, physical inactivity and deprivation; football\-based employment programme \[text removed for publication\], American football\-based physical activity intervention \[text removed for publication\] and Magic Bus’ Explorer intervention in primary schools in areas of deprivation. Including: 

-  a 123% increase in \[text removed for publication\] participants gaining employment or going into formal education. 

-  \[text removed for publication\] being rolled out nationally to over 300 schools with more than 20,000 participants and \[text removed for publication\] being expanded to a Premier League\-wide programme delivered by 25 clubs, reaching at least 500 individuals per year. 

-  established that Magic Bus’s intervention was not effective in achieving its desired outcomes leading to GBP60,000 being redirected to settings where the programme could be more effective. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Following social programme evaluation guidelines from Walker and Hills \[R4\], Dr Hills led three mixed\-methodology evaluations of \[text removed for publication\] football\-based employment training called ‘\[text removed for publication\], the \[text removed for publication\] American Football\-based physical activity intervention, ‘\[text removed for publication\],’ and the award\-winning Indian S4D charity Magic Bus’s ‘Explorer’ intervention. Recommendations on how to maximise beneficiary impacts targeted small or statistically insignificant effects and were developed by cross\-referencing qualitative findings with theoretical best practices. 

 **1:** ‘\[text removed for publication\]’ **Evaluation:** Dr. Hills was the lead investigator and co\-writer of the study \[R1\], collaborating with Dr. Matthew Walker of Texas A&M University and Dr. Bob Heere of the University of Texas. This study went through peer review and was published in 2017 in the Journal of Business Ethics. Initial findings from this study were presented at the 2013 Sport Marketing Association Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

 In 2012\-2013, \[text removed for publication\] partnered to deliver a football\-based employment training called \[text removed for publication\]to help 86 London\-based NEET \(not in employment, education or training\) individuals \(63% of whom were Black and Minority Ethnic\). \[text removed for publication\] was found by Hills et al. to have statistically significant but small effects for eight variables \(e.g., self\-mastery, employment ambition and employability skills\) and a statistically significant and moderate effect for perceived marketability \[R1\]. Only 40% \(34 out of 86\) participants went on to gain employment or go into formal education within a year of completing \[text removed for publication\]. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data found that small effects and lack of hard outcomes were due to \(1\) conflicting understanding whereby \[text removed for publication\] envisioned \[text removed for publication\] as using football to achieve employment in any sector, but \[text removed for publication\] were focused on employment in football, \(2\) a lack of focus on the skills needed for employment, \(3\) a need for greater focus on attitude change, and \(4\) absence of a pathway to translate positive attitudes into enduring outcomes \[R1\]. 

 **2:** ‘\[text removed for publication\]’ **Evaluation:** Dr. Hills was the lead investigator, lead writer and first author of the study \[R2\], collaborating with Dr. Walker and Dr. Barry, both of Texas A&M University. The peer reviewed study was published in Sport Management Review and presented at the 2017 North American Association of Sport Management Conference in Denver, Colorado. 

 In 2014\-15, the \[text removed for publication\] piloted an American Football\-based physical activity intervention called ‘\[text removed for publication\]’ for 223 8 to 11 year old children \(57% BAME\) primary schools in deprived areas of London, at a time when only 24% of boys and 22% of girls in London met recommended levels of physical activity \(British Heart Foundation, 2015\) and when one in three children in the UK were overweight or obese \(King’s College London, 2015\). ‘\[text removed for publication\]’ was evaluated through a shared value lens by studying beneficiary impacts and business impacts. In terms of social impacts, there were significant but small effects on vigorous and moderate intensity physical activity and physical activity commitment and a significant and large effect on physical activity enjoyment, but no statistically significant effect on character development. In terms of corporate impacts, there were significant and large effects on team identification, sport identification, league identification and sport participation, but no significant effect on advocacy or patronage \[R2\]. 

 **3: Magic Bus ‘Explorer’ Evaluation:** Dr. Hills was the lead researcher, lead writer and first author of the study \[R3\], collaborating with Dr. Walker and Dr. Dixon, both of Texas A&M University. This study was published in 2019 in the peer\-reviewed Journal of Sport Management and presented at the 2019 North American Association of Sport Management Conference in New Orleans, Louisiana. 

 In 2015\-16, Magic Bus, an award\-winning Indian S4D charity \(Laureus, 2014\), piloted their ‘Explorer’ intervention in primary schools in deprived areas of London for 134 6\-10 year olds \(69% BAME\). Hills et al.’s evaluation of the Explorer programme found it had no statistically significant effect on social competence, conflict management, diversity awareness and attitudes, bullying, sense of community in school, emotional awareness or goal\-setting. Lack of effect can be partly attributed to high baseline measures, indicating that assumed deficiencies were not as present in the UK context as Magic Bus had assumed. Furthermore, thematic analysis of the qualitative data found that absence of beneficiary impact was due to \(1\) a lack of focus on a clearly defined and measurable social needs, attempting to validate the Magic Bus model in London rather than identify and tackle an evidenced social problem, \(2\) misalignments whereby some outcomes were not supported with programme mechanisms and some programme mechanisms did not correspond to an outcome and \(3\) a lack of programme clarity in terms of its fit with meeting schools’ physical education \(PE\) and personal, social, health and emotional education \(PSHE\) curriculums \[R3\].

 Hills et al’s research informed improved delivery and outcomes for both \[text removed for publication\], justifying and evidencing their national roll out and ongoing delivery, and also established the limitations of the Magic Bus programme, leading to funds being redirected more effectively. 

 **1:** ‘\[text removed for publication\] **Evaluation:** In its first year \(2012\-13\), the \[text removed for publication\] programme delivered by the \[text removed for publication\]Foundation and funded by \[text removed for publication\] for £350,000 \[C2\] provided a 10\-week employability programme for 86 London\-based 16\-25 year old NEETs. To counter the programme’s limitations \[R1\], Hills recommended to \[text removed for publication\] that: \(1\) The use of football be extended beyond being used as a ‘hook’ for recruitment and incorporated into employment training, such as through sport analogy\-based training \[R5\] and that the expertise of \[text removed for publication\] be leveraged more, so as to provide employment through sport, rather than employment in sport, as the intervention had initially achieved. \(2\) That the learning outcomes be more realistic for a 10\-week intervention, such that greater effect be achieved over fewer outcomes. \(3\) To develop an exit strategy to translate the ‘soft’ outcomes of attitude change into ‘hard’ outcomes of skills and employment. 

 As the Assistant Vice President of \[text removed for publication\] described, the impact of Hills’ evaluation was significant in changing both the aims and delivery of subsequent and larger renditions of \[text removed for publication\]: “Dr. Hills’ evaluation of our pilot programme was critical in shaping the programme as it was rolled out. Based upon the evidence and recommendations provided, we repositioned our programme to be more focused on using sport to achieve employment generally, rather than achieving employment in sport, we redeveloped our curriculum and focused on the critical needs of our participants, and we created a new position where we had a dedicated person working with our participants on their exit pathways, developing networks with potential local employers and helping participants with applications for employment and education” \[C1\]. 

 In the first year of the programme 40% \(34 out of 86\) of total participants had gained employment or returned to formal education a year after their participation. As described by \[text removed for publication\], in the subsequent two years \(2013\-2015\), the renewed \[text removed for publication\] reached a further 214 participants. Of these, 89% \(191 out of 214\) gained employment or returned to formal education, an improvement of 123% \[C3\]. 

 The implementation of Hills’ recommendations also yielded impacts beyond the \[text removed for publication\] programme and its targeted beneficiaries. 

 First, the subsequent success of \[text removed for publication\], as informed by Hills’ research, convinced \[text removed for publication\] to increase their investment in employability through football, supporting an additional 24 professional football clubs and at least 500 NEET individuals a year \[C5\], who participated in an expanded and rebranded \[text removed for publication\]. Premier League Works was launched in 2015 with 20 clubs; 17 Premier League clubs and 3 Championship clubs and initially reached 500 participants \[C5\]. By the 2019/20 season, 25 clubs in the top two tiers of English football were participating in the scheme \[C4\]. As described by \[text removed for publication\] Assistant VP, ‘\[text removed for publication\] served as a pilot for \[text removed for publication\] Premier League Works, whereby we expanded the programme to initially 20 clubs and ultimately to 25 clubs via our commercial sponsorship of the Premier League. The success of \[text removed for publication\], as informed by Dr. Hills’ research, was a critical factor in our decision to expand our investment” \[C1\]. 

 Second, Dr. Hills’ research not only contributed to justifying the funding of Premier League Works, but also informed its design and delivery, enhancing the benefits to the 24 additional clubs and at least 500 participants per year \[C4\]. As described by \[text removed for publication\] Assistant VP, “The lessons learned from Dr. Hills’ research of \[text removed for publication\] fed directly into the design and delivery of \[text removed for publication\] Premier League Works, whereby the \[text removed for publication\] model we developed in collaboration with Dr. Hills became the model for \[text removed for publication\] Premier League Works” \[C1\] 

 Third, Hills’ research benefited \[text removed for publication\] because, although they were no longer a Premier League club at the time of the launch of Premier League Works, the evidence of their experience and success in delivering \[text removed for publication\], as provided by the research, was critical for their inclusion in Premier League Works, receiving by 2020 an additional five years of funding to deliver their employability programme. As \[text removed for publication\] Assistant VP has said, ‘\[text removed for publication\] were able to show previous experience and success in delivering \[text removed for publication\] in their successful application for funding through Premier League Works” \[C1\]. 

 Fourth, the Premier League Works model, informed by Hills’ research, has continued to benefit young people. While \[text removed for publication\] has not sponsored Premier League Works or the Premier League since the 2018/19 season, the league has continued to deliver Premier League Works in partnership with the Professional Footballers’ Association \(PFA\) and the Prince’s Trust \[C4\]. 

 Fifth, the subsequent success of \[text removed for publication\] Premier League Works benefited \[text removed for publication\], as advised by \[text removed for publication\] Assistant VP, who stated: “The success of \[text removed for publication\] Premier League Works helped us reach our targets around supporting young people. And because at the time of creating \[text removed for publication\] Premier League Works, the \[text removed for publication\] overall CSR strategy had been more clearly defined to be employment and/or financial skills, this then became a key strand of \[text removed for publication\] CSR work going forward. And allowed us to connect with the commercial sponsorship of the Premier League” \[C1\]. 

 **2:** ‘\[text removed for publication\]’ **Evaluation:** In 2014\-15, \[text removed for publication\] was delivered as a pilot to 223 8\-11 year old children in 10 schools in the London boroughs of Brent and Lambeth. As a result of Hills’ finding of strong corporate impacts \(i.e. fan development\), \[text removed for publication\]was expanded from a London\-based pilot to a nationwide programme, as of 2019, spreading the social benefits of the \[text removed for publication\] programme and developing fandom in more than 300 schools and more than 20,000 school children across the UK, as reported by \[text removed for publication\] International \[C7\]. According to the \[text removed for publication\]’s Head of Community “The evidence provided by Dr. Hills and his colleagues was communicated to the highest levels of our organisation and was fundamental in the decision to roll out the programme across the UK” \[C6\]. 

 As well as providing evidence to justify the expansion of \[text removed for publication\], Hills et al.’s research informed improved delivery, leading to greater social and corporate outcomes. To further enhance the significant and large effects on fandom\-related variables, Hills et al. recommended that the programme should be reconceived around team \(rather than league\) fandom, with greater integration of \[text removed for publication\] team brands into schools. To overcome the small increases in physical activity and the absence of effect on character development Hills et al. recommended \(1\) that programme contact time should be increased to achieve greater beneficiary impacts and \(2\) that the curriculum should incorporate intentional design characteristics for character development supported by sport analogies and role models \[R5\]. As reported by the \[text removed for publication\]’s Head of Community, implementation of Hills’ recommendation had informed the development and expansion of the programme and enhanced content delivery: “The insights and recommendations put forth by Dr. Hills and colleagues have informed subsequent delivery of \[text removed for publication\]. Notably, on the basis of Dr. Hills’ recommendations, we partnered every school with a \[text removed for publication\] team, incorporated homework into the programme so to extend contact with participants and we redeveloped the character curriculum. Our subsequent monitoring and evaluation of \[text removed for publication\] has found that these changes have been effective and increased levels of physical activity in our participants and enhanced their connection to \[text removed for publication\] teams, although character development remains a challenge we continue to work on. \[text removed for publication\] remains a key element of our international strategy” \[C6\]. 

 **3: Magic Bus ‘Explorer’ Evaluation:** In 2015\-16, the Magic Bus Explorer programme was evaluated in its first year of delivery as a pilot to 134 participants. This programme used a Laureus Sport for Good award\-winning methodology developed in Mumbai, India, to target 6 to 10 year old school children in the borough of Lambeth, London. Once the research identified that the Explorer programme had no significant effect on any of the desired outcomes, Hills recommended that Magic Bus completely rethink their strategy by \(1\) identifying and targeting a clearly defined and evidenced social problem in London, \(2\) to map desired outcomes and programme mechanisms and \(3\) consider the UK legal context to reposition as a physically active PSHE class, rather than a PE class, due to the greater flexibility in the PSHE national curriculum versus the rigid PE national curriculum that the programme does not sufficiently address \[R3\]. 

 The lack of significant effects and Hills’ recommendations to completely rethink their strategy informed Magic Bus’s decision “to discontinue the entire programme at the end of the 2017 academic year. The decision was made in part to align with the older age range being targeted in India and other geographies” \[C9, p. 5\] and redirect annual programme cost funds of £62,767 \[C9, p. 20\] to India and other geographies. According to the Interim CEO of Magic Bus “Dr. Hills’ evaluation of the Explorer programme established its limited outcomes and the significant steps which would be necessary in order to make the programme work. This greatly helped us to understand the challenges of applying our India developed model to London. Considering the limited impact of our London\-based programme, as evidenced by Dr. Hills’ evaluation, it became apparent to us that the funds would be better spent in contexts where needs are greater and our model has previously been effective” \[C8\]. As such, Hills et al.’s research benefited Magic Bus in terms of informing more effective distribution of their funds and the communities where these funds were subsequently utilised.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Novel mechanisms of action for the antimicrobial polymer polyhexanide biguanide \(PHMB\) have been identified through RVC research demonstrating its penetration into cells, formation of nanoparticles with a range of compounds and mediation of functional delivery into cells. Following patent filings and company creation to commercialise the technology, impacts include investment from private individuals and venture capital; sales of research kits and services; influence on regulatory agencies’ decisions and guidance, and out\-licensing for both human and veterinary product applications. In addition to 3 \(2 completed\) clinical trials in human health, the technology platform has been developed via a multi\-million dollar \(USD\) license deal to a global animal health business for both production and companion animal applications.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Liam Good was recruited to the RVC in 2007 from Karolinska Institute to add a new dimension to RVC’s research addressing the global issue of antimicrobial resistance. Good’s expertise in antisense approaches to inhibit essential genes in bacteria provided several new possibilities for development. In particular, the work led\-on to the development of peptide nucleic acid fluorescence *in situ* hybridisation \(PNA\-FISH\) probes for bacteria detection and his idea of overcoming cell delivery barriers by linking oligomers to cell wall active peptides has enabled drug target validation through RNA silencing \(patented in 2001\); the method is now widely used in early\-stage drug development. However, as a possible therapy, antibacterial antisense agents and the delivery strategies face cost, stability and toxicity problems that limited developments.  Nevertheless, the work showed that relatively large molecules can enter microbes and cationic peptides can even act as carriers to deliver reagents and drugs. 

 On arrival at the RVC, a major research goal was to devise ways to improve the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides into bacteria, since Good had shown they could be used to provide remarkable selectivity of antibacterial activity, something lacking from conventional antimicrobial drugs. To this end, he examined polymers that offered similar structural properties to the carrier peptides, but which could provide affordable, stable and safe solutions. The group was attracted to the polymer, polyhexanide biguanide \(PHMB\), also known as polyhexanide, which is widely used in industrial applications for its antimicrobial properties \(e.g. in wound care and as contact lens disinfectant\). Such cationic polymers are generally believed to provide antimicrobial effects through preferential targeting of the negatively charged lipids within bacterial cells; however, the team’s experience with peptides suggested that the mechanism\(s\) may be more nuanced and involve cell entry. The first direct insight came from constructing a fluoro\-tagged version of the polymer and tracking the localisation in pathogens and host cells. The results were surprising and striking, showing that PHMB efficiently enters all microbial and mammalian cells types examined \[1\].  This raised new questions about its mechanism\(s\) of antimicrobial action and safety profile and raised possibilities for diverse practical applications that could potentially address otherwise intractable delivery challenges. To further investigate mechanisms, the team studied the uptake pathways, tracked localisation over time and measured the effects on cell membrane integrity.  The results revealed that the polymer enters bacterial cells with little damage to cell membranes but then condenses chromosomes \[1\].  In mammalian cells, the polymer enters via dynamin\-dependent endocytosis and is largely retained in endosomes and excluded from the nucleus, explaining its selective toxicity against microbes \[2\]. This supported the idea that the polymer can be used as a delivery technology and greatly broadened the scope for applications. In follow\-on studies, the team assessed whether the polymer could be used to form complexes \(nanoparticles\) with reagents and drugs and mediate delivery into bacteria, fungi, parasites and mammalian cells \[2\-5\].  In addition, the team demonstrated that the polymer is directly antimicrobial against hard to inhibit intracellular pathogens \[2\-4\]. 

 With these observations in place, multiple academic and industrial research collaborations have ensued to further define the antimicrobial mechanisms and understand opportunities for practical applications of the polymer\-mediated delivery approach. The work has also influenced regulatory agencies’ decisions and guidance. Thus, what commenced as research into efficient carriers to enhance cell penetration into bacteria led to the discovery of PHMB’s novel mechanisms of action involving cell uptake and this knowledge has underpinned a range of impacts detailed below. Promising work with long\-term potential for impact continues at RVC, to pursue the original aim of reagent and drug delivery into bacteria, specifically to develop alternatives to traditional antibiotic\-based strategies for infection control.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 When the research team recognised the ability to improve cell and tissue delivery using a polymer with an excellent safety profile, RVC protected the relevant intellectual property through patent filing \(WO2013054123\) in all major territories and licensed the technology to a spin\-out company, Tecrea Ltd, formed in 2012, as a vehicle for commercialisation and out\-licensing of the platform technology in several sectors. Tecrea’s progress in animal health has led to formation of a progeny spin\-out: Tecrea Animal Health Ltd. Activities have delivered multiple impacts in the form of company formation, jobs created, inward investments, product sales, services sales, influence on court decisions, royalties to RVC, and progress in the development of new therapies for human \(reaching clinical trial stage IIb\) and animal health, as illustrated in Figure 1. 



 **Figure 1:** **Illustration of RVC, Tecrea and partner relationships and impacts.* 

 Tecrea’s direct sales of research kits are principally intended to facilitate research and build long\-term development partnerships with its customer base, but additionally generate revenue. Research kits are currently exported to 40 institutions in >20 countries, including major economies in the EU, North America and Asia. Between founding and October 2020, payments to HMRC/PAYE amount to GBP617,342, with additional yearly corporation tax and VAT payments \[a\]. Royalty payments to RVC amount to GBP137,350 \[a\].  Consequently, only limited equity investment has been sought, with GBP1,450,000 raised to provide security for its sales/marketing operation in Alderley Park and staff growth to 9 employees \(headcount: 9; FTEs: 9\) \[a\]. The current product range includes: Nanocin\-plasmid: for transfection of plasmid DNA; Nanocin\-RNA: for transfection of RNA; Nanocin\-SM: for cell delivery of poorly cell permeable small molecules; and Nanocin\-PRO: for cell delivery of proteins and peptides \[a\]. Drug formulation and cell screening fees for services to Biotech and Pharma since August 2013 have generated GBP588,000. IP Pragmatics Ltd estimated that the net value of Tecrea at the end of 2020 was between GBP12,400,000 and GBP19,100,000 \[b\]. 

 Blueberry Therapeutics Ltd was set\-up to in\-license and exploit Tecrea’s technology together with technology licensed in from AstraZeneca, in pursuit of certain human clinical applications and has attracted GBP15,000,000 of investment \[c\]. Building on Tecrea’s technology, Blueberry has filed 11 patents and their pipeline has expanded to 5 drugs, having USD50,000,000,000 in commercial potential \[c\]. During the REF period, job numbers in Blueberry increased from 1 to 20 \(FTE:15\) \[c\]. The Nanocin technology is a key element of a formulation, which has completed 2 phase I/II clinical trials in humans relating to large market human dermatological conditions, meeting all primary end points \[c, d, e\]. Fungal nail bed infections \(onchomycoses\) are the primary disease target which has 10\-23% prevalence in the major markets globally \[c, d\]. Building on this progress, a multi\-site international Phase IIb trial initiated during 2019 was funded and has received FDA regulatory approval to proceed \[c, d\]. The test formulation reduces antifungal drug terbinafine usage by 10,000\-fold, thus reducing liver and kidney exposure to damage caused by systemic terbinafine administration. Recruitment to this trial was initiated in early 2020, but was paused in March 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, before finally restarting in the last quarter of 2020 \[c, d\]. As an indication of the overall success of this programme, in a single agreement, Blueberry received USD12,000,000 \(08\-2018\) funding and an out\-licensing deal with an Asian\-based global pharma \[f\]. 

 Building on the strategy established with Blueberry, Tecrea’s out\-licencing has proved highly successful, with 8 active out\-license agreements in place with human and animal health companies in UK, USA, Asia and Sweden – spanning SMEs and multi\-nationals including a top 10 global animal health pharma \[a, g, h\]. Out\-licensing revenue exceeded GBP1,000,000 during 2019/2020 tax year \[a\]. In 2020, Tecrea agreed a further out\-license with the Asia\-based global pharma, with a fee achieved; manufacturing for sales is expected in 2021 \[a\]. In Europe/USA, one of Tecrea’s licensing partners \(a Confidential Animal Health Corporation\) has sponsored several animal trials and the results have led to an out\-license being signed with Tecrea Animal Health Ltd. involving 7\-figure \(USD\) development milestones with funds received early 2020 \[a\]. Multiple production animal and companion animal health applications using the Nanocin platform are being pursued in parallel, each with large market potential. 

 In addition to out\-licensing for therapeutic product development, Tecrea Ltd has partnered with companies including AstraZeneca; Cobra Biologics; Nanoptima Ltd; \[Text removed for publication\] and Blueberry Therapeutics Ltd \[a\]. This has involved matched counter\-funding from commercial partners within Innovate UK and EU supported projects, including a recent grant awarded for SARS\-CoV\-2 related product development. Project costs total GBP1,500,000 with commercial matched funding total of GBP394,000, with the majority spent on understanding and developing Tecrea’s technology \[a\]. Areas of investigation that have attracted commercial partner investments in the technology include oncology, inflammation, bioprocessing and several areas of infection, including CoV\-2 inactivation. 

 Improved fundamental understanding of PHMB’s antimicrobial properties has underpinned a decision by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices \(BfARM\) leading to a change in classification of a PHMB containing product from a medical device to a pharmaceutical \[i\]. Professor Good was consulted through contract and questioned at the Cologne court case leading to the decision \[i\]. Additionally, in France, the Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety \(ANSES\) has released a notice entitled “Évaluation de la résistance aux biocides antimicrobiens” which describes our new understanding of the mechanism of action of PHMB \[j\]. These government actions both cite the RVC research and the impacts are in diverse areas, including drug registration and infection control recommendations.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Locally compact groups are fundamental to mathematics and physics, and form a core part of many advanced undergraduate and MSc mathematics curricula. Until recently, these courses focused on locally compact groups that are “connected”, relying on academic insights circa 1950, because very little was known about those which are “totally disconnected”. 

 From discoveries in the 1990s a theory of totally disconnected locally compact \(“tdlc”\) groups emerged, but by 2013 there remained a central problem: the theory depended heavily on understanding tdlc groups that are compactly generated and simple, but researchers did not know how many of these groups there were. In 2017, Smith solved this problem. By developing a new product for groups, Smith’s research determined the number of these simple groups and showed that the preferred tool used by researchers at the time \(“isomorphism”\) could not be used to categorise them. This caused a **paradigm shift** in the field, and **changes in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula** internationally. 

 Associated research by Khukhro gave new insights into the commutativity properties of groups and Lie rings and has been **incorporated into the syllabus of an advanced course on group theory** in Brazil.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Algebra and group theory lie in the foundations of mathematics, providing structure to various mathematical theories, as well as giving the language for applications of mathematics in physics, chemistry and other sciences. The algebraic research in the University of Lincoln’s Charlotte Scott Research Centre for Algebra is focused on group theory and the theory of Lie rings. 

 Within group theory, the study of \(non\-discrete\) topological groups that are locally compact is a longstanding area of research. The study famously begins with a natural decomposition into the connected and totally disconnected cases. Pivotal research by Prof. George Willis in the 1990s opened up the field of totally disconnected locally compact groups, and whilst connected locally compact groups are broadly understood following the solution to Hilbert’s 5th problem, totally disconnected locally compact groups are in comparison poorly understood, even those that are compactly generated. The key to understanding compactly generated tdlc groups lies in understanding those that are topologically simple, and so a central problem in the field was to determine \(up to isomorphism\) the number of such groups. 

 To address this, Smith applied his research on permutation groups to the study of compactly generated tdlc groups. In **\[3.1\]**, Smith solved this problem by developing a new product for permutation groups and topological groups, called the box product. The box product provides a general way to easily build exotic examples of \(non\-discrete\) simple, tdlc, compactly generated topological groups from discrete groups. Using it, Smith showed that \(up to isomorphism\) there are precisely as many of these groups as there are real numbers, by constructing an uncountable family of simple, totally disconnected, compactly generated, locally compact groups. He also showed that classifying these simple groups up to isomorphism was impossible, leading to the field of tdlc research shifting its focus away from the isomorphism relation and towards something called a “local isomorphism”. 

 Some of the most important properties in group theory are commutativity properties. Recent results obtained by Evgeny Khukhro and his coauthors are theorems on the commutativity properties of groups and Lie rings admitting almost fixed\-point\-free automorphisms **\[3.2\].** They for the first time obtained a bound for the derived length of a group with an automorphism of composite order in terms of its fixed points, which demonstrated for the first time a possibility for the application of Lie ring methods to a well\-known problem about such bounds. Another set of results by Khukhro and his coauthor **\[3.3\]** introduced a new type of generalised Engel conditions for finite and profinite groups and developed novel methods for applications of Zelmanov's theorem and Hall–Higman type reductions.

 Our research demonstrates a step change in academic understanding of group theory, with these conceptual changes enabling a number of changes within mathematics curricula at HEIs. 

 <ins> **Impact on core understanding and theory**</ins> 

 A paradigm shift in the core understanding of a subject necessitates changes in curricula. We begin by giving details of the impact of Smith’s research on this core understanding. Smith’s result led to the entire “ *field shifting its focus away from global isomorphism relations…towards local isomorphism relations”* **\[5.1\].** It now forms part of the core theory of tdlc groups and features prominently in the main textbook on tdlc group theory **\[5.2\],** with an entire chapter devoted to it: the chapter is titled “Simon Smith’s construction of an uncountable family of simple, totally disconnected, locally compact groups” \(more detail below\).  Pierre\-Emmanuel Caprace \(one of the world’s most highly\-cited algebraists\) gave a prestigious address to the 7th European Congress of Mathematics about the study of these simple groups, and wrote a survey paper for the proceedings. In the concluding remarks of the survey **\[5.3, page 17\]** he writes *“the study of \[these simple groups\] should not be aimed at a classification up to isomorphism: \[Smith’s result\] provides strong evidence that this classification problem is \[essentially impossible\]*”. As one of the co\-authors of the textbook writes in his testimonial **\[5.1\],** Smith’s result gives the “ *correct*” perspective on the theory of locally compact groups. This correction required HEIs to update their curricula; we give details below.

 **New standard textbook for courses on totally disconnected locally compact groups has one chapter exclusively devoted to Smith’s research** **\[3.1\]** 

 The breakthroughs by Prof. George Willis in the 1990s in the theory of locally compact groups resulted in many universities running courses on totally disconnected locally compact \(tdlc\) groups. However, until 2018 there was no single textbook that could be used for such a course. This changed in 2018 with the London Mathematical Society \(LMS\) publication of a Lecture Note Series textbook entitled “New Directions in Locally Compact Groups”, published by Cambridge University Press. This textbook was produced to drive forward the field of locally compact groups. In the textbook \(which has 20 chapters\), an entire chapter authored by Prof. George Willis \(the pre\-eminent expert on tdlc groups\) and Dr Colin Reid is dedicated to Smith’s work. Entitled “Simon Smith's construction of an uncountable family of simple, totally disconnected, locally compact groups” **\[5.2\],** it presents the results in Smith’s paper **\[3.1\]**, which provide a fundamental change of perspective on these simple groups, causing the field to move “ *its focus away from global isomorphism relations…towards local isomorphism relations*” **\[5.1\]**. This chapter forms a core part of a syllabus on tdlc groups because it gives the correct perspective, that “ *the study of \[these simple groups\] should not be aimed at a classification*” using the standard tool in group theory, “ *isomorphism*” \[ **5.3, page 17\].** 

 Despite only being published in 2018, this textbook has already been assigned as recommended reading in a 2019 course for undergraduates and masters students at ETH Zürich **\[5.4\].** In **\[5.1\]**, one of the co\-authors of the LMS textbook states that “ *This textbook is now the textbook choice for a modern course on locally compact groups with a focus on tdlc groups. Any course that closely follows this textbook would include Smith’s result prominently.”* 

 **Change in mathematical curricula and course requirements** 

 In addition to being used in undergraduate mathematics curricula at the University of Lincoln \(new Group Theory course MTH3003M focusing on permutation groups, **\[5.5\]**\), the research has led to curricula and course changes in the UK and overseas.

 At Binghamton University, USA, a course entitled *Math 603A Locally Compact Groups* was delivered in autumn 2017. The curriculum of the course covered Smith’s construction in **\[3.1\]** of an uncountable family of simple, compactly generated, totally disconnected, locally compact groups **\[5.1\].** As noted in **\[5.1\],** this result was presented to the students in order to give the “ *correct*” perspective on the theory of locally compact groups.

 At the University of Oxford, a course on Totally Disconnected Locally Compact Groups was given in Spring 2018 **\[5.6\]** \(before publication of the LMS textbook\). The course overview states that “ *The goal of the course is to introduce the central ideas in this new theory \[of tdlc groups\]*”. As evidenced previously, the box product construction in **\[3.1\]** by Smith is a central idea that gives the “ *correct*” perspective on the theory. To obtain credit for the course at Oxford, students had to complete one of the four “Credit Options” **\[5.7\].** The 4th credit option is “ *Define the box product first introduced in \`A product for permutation groups and topological groups’ by Simon Smith, and explain when the box product of two groups is a separable tdlc group.*”

 A course on Lie ring methods in group theory is an advanced course in group theory that can be found at many HEIs around the world. Typically, it is taught to postgraduate students. Such a course ran at the University of Brasilia, Brazil, in the second semester 2018, taught by Dr Cristina Acciarri, attended by 5 PhD students and 3 MSc students. This course in Brasilia strived to bring the students up to the cutting\-edge for results about Lie ring methods in group theory. Khukhro’s work **\[3.2, 3.3\]** featured prominently in a revised curriculum of a course on “Lie ring methods in group theory” delivered at the University of Brasilia in 2018. Indeed, Dr Acciarri attests **\[5.8\]** “ *when designing the syllabus we encountered two issues: …existing textbooks \[only covered\] well\-established techniques \[for tackling a well\-known problem\]*” and “ *we needed…a source of new types of problems…appropriate for our students…\[that\] fit with the course material. The syllabus…was influenced by **\[3.2\]** and **\[3.3\]** because these papers helped us address these two issues.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UK public sector health and social care organisations are under pressure to reduce costs and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their services. The complexity of health and social services systems creates challenges in this endeavour. Using participative methodologies, research by Dr Antuela Tako and Professor Stewart Robinson underpinned the development of simulation models adopted by health and social care organisations in Leicestershire to transform their systems and practices. This work led to a successful Leicestershire County Council business case to secure financial support for its Lightbulb service; more efficient service \(40% faster\) at operational level; reduced costs \(GBP180,000 per year\) for Leicestershire’s health system; improved service satisfaction for more than 5,400 frail and elderly people in Leicestershire; and the design of a new ‘falls and frailty’ support service for Rutland County Council.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Simulation tools are used to model and analyse organisational processes and gain insights about how these can be improved, particularly in a healthcare context. However, their adoption in the healthcare industry has been limited, meaning the solutions and insights that can be gained are seldom transferred into practice. 

 For example, only 14% of academic papers on healthcare simulation have reported implementation of results. According to a study by Tako and Robinson, this is often due to the complexity and organisational barriers in healthcare organisations, lack of understanding between analyst and client, or a belief that the solutions found are irrelevant **\[R1\]**. 

 Tako and Robinson’s work in healthcare operational research at Loughborough has played a major role in addressing these challenges. They developed participative simulation methodologies that actively engage organisational stakeholders and/or their users in workshops to evaluate the efficiency of health and social care services **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 These methodologies focus on co\-developing simulation models in workshops with a group of stakeholders, with joint analysis taking place to identify feasible and desirable solutions. Workshops are supported by a simulation analyst and a facilitator, creating a forum for open discussion. Tako and Robinson’s research found this approach significantly increased the probability of stakeholder commitment to implementation, leading to improved organisational processes and efficiencies **\[R2, R3\]**. 

 In collaboration with Kotiadis \(then Warwick, now Kent\), Tako developed a participative methodology named PartiSim for simulation in healthcare. It consists of prescribed activities and tools that support both the facilitation process and the creation of simulation models participatively. The key output of the research was a toolset available to simulation analysts to support their engagement with healthcare practitioners in modelling workshops. The latest version was produced in June 2018. Development and testing in three healthcare settings showed such an approach could help reach consensus about actions to be taken, leading to implementation **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. For example, PartiSim was used to support an obesity care service to help prioritise planned investments in new capacity, enabling the service to improve patient waiting times and meet future anticipated demand **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. 

 Tako and Robinson then developed SIMTEGR8, which adapted and combined two existing methodologies: PartiSim **\[R2, R3, R4\]** and SimLean **\[R5\]**. These were tailored to the evaluation of community\-based health and social care services in Leicestershire, which are characterised by de\-centralised hierarchical structures, with distributed power and knowledge. SIMTEGR8 also incorporated patient input into the evaluation **\[R6\]**. 

 The project was based heavily on insights gained through Tako and Robinson’s research on practitioners’ experiences of simulations in health contexts and the particular challenges therein **\[R1\]**. A key part of the evaluation involved running a set of workshops with both service providers and service users \(patients\) **\[R6\]**, using a computer simulation as a dynamic process map to stimulate discussion about the patient journey and to identify improvements in workflows **\[R6\]**. The research conducted through SIMTEGR8 further advanced existing methodology **\[R2, R3, R4, R5\]** by adapting and combining existing facilitation processes for the evaluation of community\-based health and social care services.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 SIMTEGR8 arose from a programme of research that supported the design and development of integrated health and social care services in Leicestershire between 2014 and 2017. Given the complex multi\-agency nature of these services – including healthcare organisations and housing support providers at district council level, as well as the local Clinical Commissioning Group – SIMTEGR8 and the expertise of the research team suited Leicestershire County Council’s \(LCC\) need for an independent evaluation of its planned provision of community\-based services at the beginning of this period. 

 The service that used SIMTEGR8 most fully was Lightbulb, which delivers housing improvements such as level\-access showers or stairlifts for the frail and elderly. The service aims to enable residents to stay safe in their homes and prevent falls, reducing the need for hospital beds. Specific impacts of Tako and Robinson’s research are outlined below. 

 *• **Supported LCC’s successful business case for the Lightbulb service** 

 SIMTEGR8 delivered evidence to support the business case developed for Lightbulb while the service operated on a pilot basis between 2015 and 2017. The analysis enabled identification of how resources such as staff and budgets could be more effectively deployed and how a quicker service could be provided to patients. It played a crucial role in validating expected performance targets in the business case submitted in November 2016 to secure funding. 

 In 2020 Blaby District Council’s Chief Executive commented: “The project provided a credible evidence base supporting the case for ongoing investment in the service and was a huge benefit within the NHS context, where decisions on funding allocation are made on very robust business cases” **\[S6\]**. LCC’s then Director of Health and Care Integration stated: “The SIMTEGR8 modelling was an essential part of developing the care pathway and the evaluation process for the pilot during the development phase of this project... \[It\] helped prove the concept both operationally and financially. The service has since been fully implemented and commissioned on a recurrent basis over multiple financial years.” **\[S7\]** 

 Following the success of the business case, Lightbulb became fully operational in 2017 **\[S2\]**. It has continued to operate ever since, albeit with significant adaptations in light of the Covid\-19 pandemic and consequent restrictions **\[S9\]**. 

 *• **Increased the efficiency of services at operational level** 

 Analysis based on SIMTEGR8 simulations identified changes in processes and workforce configuration, resulting in a streamlined and shorter user journey through the service. In 2020 LCC’s then Director of Health and Care Integration commented that SIMTEGR8 made clear that Lightbulb “needed one point of contact for customers, rather than the seven that we had at that point, for people needing support in their homes” **\[S7\]** *.* 

 The changes implemented led to a more efficient service, resulting in “a reduction in waiting times and in the stages involved, with requests for a level\-access shower resolved in 13 stages \(in 2017\), as opposed to 27 previously \(2016\)” **\[S2, S6\]**. A 40% fall in case completion times – down from 42 days to 25 days on average – was also achieved. In addition, the service consistently met the 20\-week performance target for household adaptations for disabled facility grants during the period from 2017 to 2019, having taken approximately six to eight months prior to the implementation of the changes **\[S6\]**. 

 Another service, Help to Live at Home \(HTLAH\), which manages the joint commissioning of domiciliary care for vulnerable people in Leicestershire, also benefited from SIMTEGR8. The results of the models co\-developed with service providers suggested high reliance on contingency providers, as opposed to HTLAH providers, would create a significant backlog. 

 In light of this finding, HTLAH worked with its own providers to support them in capacity planning through recruitment and retention initiatives. LCC’s HTLAH Project Manager reported in 2018 that “the service achieved a better balance between HTLAH providers and contingency providers”, reducing reliance on the latter from 41% of clients to 30% between October 2017 and March 2018 **\[S8\]**. 

 *• **Reduced costs for Leicestershire’s health system** 

 As a consequence of the redesigned Lightbulb service, a 50% reduction in service costs per case – GBP200 versus GBP400 – was achieved. This led to direct cost savings for the service of GBP180,000 per year during the 2017\-2019 period **\[S2, S6\]**. The resources released enabled the service to deliver 37% more cases than projected at the planning stage \(2016\-2017\). 

 Lightbulb also delivered economic benefits to the wider local and national health and care system, through savings of approximately GBP2.1 million during the period from 2017 to 2019 **\[S2, S6\]**.  As LCC’s former Director of Health and Care Integration explained in 2020, the estimated cost savings consisted of “costs avoided due to reductions in falls, falls call\-out conveyances, housing support co\-ordinator savings to social care, the hospital housing team in acute and mental health hospitals and disabled facility grants process reduction and the overall costs of the disabled facility grants themselves *”* **\[S7\]**. 

 For example, the reduction in falls noted above saved the local health and care economy GBP21,000 per year per fall **\[S1\]**. In addition, as explained in more detail below, the improved Lightbulb service enabled people in hospital to be discharged more quickly due to better housing support. Costs to the NHS of GBP22,000 per chronic homeless patient were saved by the timely provision of suitable housing solutions **\[S7\]**. 

 **• Improved service satisfaction levels for the frail and elderly in Leicestershire** 

 Lightbulb helped more than 5,400 people between 2017 and 2019 **\[S2\]**, with customer satisfaction levels improving following implementation of the changes to the service in 2017. 100% of those surveyed confirmed Lightbulb had met their expectations during the first half of 2019 **\[S6\]**; the figure in 2018 was 96% **\[S2\]**. In its first year of operation, between October 2017 and October 2018, 89% of the service’s users reported an improvement in their wellbeing, with the biggest areas of impact being quality of life \(up from 6 to 8.9 on a 1\-10 scale\) and mental health \(up from 4.6 to 9\) **\[S6\]**. 

 As a result of the SIMTEGR8 work, staff responsible for housing were moved from district councils to work alongside their colleagues in hospitals. This supported faster hospital discharges, which led to improved user experience and outcomes. The Chief Executive of Blaby District Council stated: “The revised processes enabled people in hospital to get out of hospital quicker, because they had better housing support. Over the two\-year period \(2017\-2019\) 1,716 patient discharges in total were supported.” **\[S6\]** 

 The improved service received recognition for the benefits delivered to vulnerable people in the community, winning the Public/Public Partnership award in the *Local Government Chronicle* Awards in 2018 **\[S3\]** and the Best Collaborative Working Initiative award from the Association for Public Service Excellence in 2017 **\[S4\]**. Lightbulb was also commended in the Collaboration category at the Home Improvement Agency Awards in 2017 **\[S5\]**. 

 *• **Designed a new ‘falls and frailty’ support service for Rutland County Council** 

 In 2020, Rutland County Council \(RCC\) requested Tako’s help in designing a new service aimed at reducing the high number of falls and hip fractures in Rutland. They needed to proactively identify and engage with patients in the community at a high risk of falling, targeting nearly 13,000 over\-55s in the county. Using the SIMTEGR8 research and participatory methodology, Tako led the project and, with Kotiadis, held several workshops with key healthcare professionals. This led to the co\-production of a concept service and delivery model named Your Community Health Project. 

 In December 2020 RCC’s two Principal Occupational Therapists \(OTs\), responsible for leading the design of the service, stated: “Dr Antuela Anthi Tako has brought objectivity, clear direction of travel, due process, inspiration and academic gravitas to our project… without her involvement we would not have the level of engagement, interest and collaboration of our partners in this project work” **\[S10\]**. The project report was presented to the RCC Cabinet in December 2020. The OTs added: “The concept has been well received, and we have commitment across RCC and the Primary Care Network \(PCN\) to take this project forward.…across all communities in Rutland.” **\[S10\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by Professor Robert Wintemute at King’s College London drove the development of an equal legal framework for different\-sex and same\-sex couples beyond the first step of decriminalising sexual activity. Using strategic litigation, Wintemute brought his human rights\-based research to the attention of supra\-national and domestic courts. Through carefully chosen test cases, interventions and advocacy, he has influenced multiple, precedent\-setting judgments for lesbian, gay and bi\-sexual \(LGB\) people. Leading courts have relied to an exceptionally high degree on his arguments. The resulting judgments require states to, *inter alia,* investigate hate crimes effectively, allow same\-sex partner immigration, create a ‘specific legal framework’ for same\-sex relationships and prohibit discrimination in pension provision. Wintemute’s work has benefited the millions of LGB people in 47 countries in Europe who can now rely on these decisions to claim equal rights. It has also changed the organisation of societies that now have to ensure that equal treatment is implemented in practice. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 For more than two decades, Wintemute has been at the forefront of human rights and discrimination research. His work involves critical analysis of leading judgments regarding same\-sex discrimination and offering human rights\-based arguments for achieving same\-sex equality through the courts. His scholarship is both comparative and jurisdiction\-specific. He argued that decriminalising same\-sex activity was merely an insufficient first stage in a progressive movement. He contended that the gap between the protections afforded to private ‘sex rights’ by Article 8 \(respect for private and family life\) of the European Convention on Human Rights \(ECHR\) and public ‘love rights’ for same\-sex couples has perpetuated social exclusion and discrimination. He argued that ‘social rights’ associated with the legal recognition of same\-sex partnerships, homes and families must follow \[1\], and that further attention needed to be given to the social, structural and institutional processes that perpetuate inequality. Wintemute argued that the abolition of the European Commission on Human Rights – which screened all applications to the European Court of Human Rights \(ECtHR\) until 1998 – meant that all its negative judgments regarding LGB equality cases were ‘frozen’. This created a ‘blank slate’ for equality arguments to be renewed before the ECtHR \[1\]. His research supporting these challenges can be examined in three main strands. 

 **Equal protection from hate crimes** 

 Wintemute argued that the criminal justice system should protect LGB people from expressions of hatred towards them \(hate speech\), which could lead to crimes of violence against them \(hate crimes\) \[2\]. He examined the gaps in UK legislation prohibiting anti\-LGB hate speech \[3\] and argued that the ECHR could be interpreted as imposing a positive obligation on governments to prosecute anti\-LGB hate speech in situations where comparable comments about a different\-sex couple or a Jewish person would have been investigated. 

 **Equal pension rights** 

 Wintemute studied EU, UK and Canadian law on the prohibition of discrimination against LGB people in all forms of employment \[3,5,6\]. Drawing upon case law in a range of jurisdictions, he argued that pension schemes that did not make the same payments to a surviving same\-sex partner as they would to a surviving different\-sex partner were acting in a discriminatory manner. He argued that, by refusing to make such payments, the deceased would effectively have been paid a lower ‘gay wage’ \(one with no expectation that a survivor’s pension would be paid\) instead of a higher ‘heterosexual wage’ \(which would pay for a surviving partner’s pension\). 

 **Marriage and civil partnership equality** 

 Wintemute’s research contended that trends in international and comparative law supported an obligation on governments to provide the same choices of legal framework to all couples, regardless of sexual orientation. His edited book, *Legal Recognition of Same\-Sex Partnerships* \[4\], the first of its kind, brought together an international team of scholars to examine the theoretical issues and the variety of legal developments around six months after the first same\-sex marriages took place in the Netherlands. This demonstrated the beginning of a legal trend towards equality. He consolidated his research on the influence of consensus on same\-sex marriage case law in the United States Supreme Court, the ECtHR and the Inter\-American Court of Human Rights \(IACtHR \[1,2,4,5,6\]\). His research on equal treatment of unmarried same\-sex couples \[4\] demonstrated an emerging ‘European consensus’ on civil partnerships. He argued that this supported the ECHR challenging the discriminatory status quo. 

 Wintemute analysed the legislative and judicial steps taken to achieve formal legal equality for LGB individuals and same\-sex couples in Canada between 1985 and 2005 \[5\]. He drew upon his comparative research to argue for further specific changes in the law in the UK and EU. He contended that the UK Government contravened the ECHR by its failure to extend the Civil Partnerships Act 2004 to different\-sex couples, after same\-sex couples were allowed to marry as well as to register a civil partnership \[3\]. Wintemute exposed the direct and indirect discrimination faced by bi\-national, same\-sex couples who wished to live together in Europe. He argued that the foreign partner must be granted a residence permit in 47 Council of Europe \(CoE\) countries \(even if the couple had not been able to marry anywhere\), and a right to be recognised as the spouse of an EU citizen \(if they had married in an EU Member State\) and to reside with the citizen in 27 EU countries \[2,5,6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Since joining King’s in 1991, Wintemute has actively sought suitable cases to take to court to challenge discrimination, drawing on his detailed knowledge of discrimination law worldwide to improve the rights of LGB individuals and same\-sex couples. Wintemute works closely with relevant non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\). He has drafted third\-party interventions on behalf of LGB organisations in six successful cases \(and four pending cases\) and represented the applicants in two successful cases in the ECtHR. He has provided informal support and advice to individuals and legal advisers in multiple cases, including the 2018 UK Supreme Court \(UKSC\) decision that led to civil partnerships for heterosexual couples \( *R. \[Steinfeld & Keidan\] v Secretary of State for International Development* \[2018\] UKSC 32\). His work has influenced legal decisions establishing important new principles prohibiting discrimination against millions of LGB persons worldwide. His research was referred to in the case that decriminalised gay sex in India \[A\] and in the case that outlawed employment discrimination in Latin America and the Caribbean \( *Duque* v *Colombia*, 26 February 2016\). For clarity, this REF case study focuses on the most significant cases in UK and EU law, and under the ECHR. 

 **Legislative reform** 

 <ins>Helping the Parliamentary Assembly of the C</ins><ins>ouncil of Europe \(PACE\)</ins> <ins>to encourage national legislative reforms</ins> 

 Wintemute advised the Committee on Equality and Non\-Discrimination of the PACE on ECHR case law during a conference on private and family life for LGBTI people in March 2018 \[B1, p. 8, fn. 18\]. He urged the PACE to go beyond the case law of the ECtHR, as it had done in prior resolutions. Resolutions of the PACE, which provide evidence of ‘European consensus’, can be persuasive in legal argument, driving national legislative reforms and ECtHR judgments. In October 2018, the PACE adopted Resolution 2239, ‘Private and family life: achieving equality regardless of sexual orientation’ \[B2\]. The PACE Resolution called on the 47 CoE Member States to go beyond the case law of the ECtHR by providing for joint adoption by same\-sex couples, extending automatic co\-parent recognition to the same\-sex partner of the parent who has given birth, and granting to same\-sex couples the same access to medically assisted procreation as unmarried different\-sex couples. 

 **Obliging the police across Europe to investigate anti\-LGB ‘hate speech’** 

 In 2017, the Lithuanian Gay League asked Wintemute to represent the applicants in the case of *Beizaras and Levickas* *v Lithuania* \[2020\] ECtHR \(41288/15\) *.* Prosecutors had failed to investigate hateful comments posted on Facebook in response to a photograph the male couple posted of themselves kissing. Wintemute framed his legal submissions based on his research \[3\], asserting that the ECHR can be interpreted as imposing a positive obligation on governments to prosecute anti\-LGB hate speech, and that comparable comments about a different\-sex couple or a Jewish person would have been investigated. The ECtHR ruled unanimously that the Lithuanian authorities’ failure to act was sexual orientation discrimination and that they must pay EUR10,000 to each of the applicants within three months of the judgment. As confirmed by Tomas Vytautas Raskevičius, who initiated the case as an independent LGBT human rights advocate, “the Professor’s knowledge and contribution was of crucial importance in defending the rights of the applicants” and his involvement in leading the case “significantly contributed to the systematic changes in responding to the negative phenomenon of hate speech and hate crimes in the Republic of Lithuania” \[C\]. 

 The judgment requires the 47 CoE countries \(with a combined population of over 830 million\) to investigate and prosecute anti\-LGB hate speech. The European Parliament Resolution of 18 December 2019 on Public Discrimination and Hate Speech against LGBTI people \(2019/2933\(RSP\)\) recommended *inter alia* that Member States establish simple procedures enabling individuals to report online hateful content and to ensure that any alleged hate crime or hate speech is effectively investigated, prosecuted and tried \[D\]. It called on the Commission to support training programmes for law enforcement and judicial authorities \[D, paras 8\-10\]. Raskevičius confirmed that, following the judgment, “ *\[Lithuanian\] law enforcement agencies are more comprehensively engaged in investigating the instances of hate speech and hate crimes… Also, a working group has been founded within the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Lithuania… with the aim of improving the institutional response to the negative phenomenon of hate speech and hate crimes… Non\-governmental organizations have started trainings for law enforcement officers”* \[C\]. 

 **Equal pension rights for surviving same\-sex spouses and civil partners** 

 In *Walker* *v* *Innospec Limited* \[2017\] UKSC 47, the UKSC took the unusual step of disapplying the provisions of the Equality Act 2010. This had allowed employers to refuse to pay a widow’s pension where a same\-sex partner had made all the pension contributions before same\-sex civil partnerships were allowed. The UKSC found unanimously that the exception was discrimination based on sexual orientation with regard to pay \(which includes pension benefits\) contrary to EU Directive 2000/78. Wintemute supported the case by publishing articles about decisions of the lower courts \[2,6\], advising Mr Walker’s barristers and commenting on drafts of their written arguments. 

 Max Schaefer, a barrister working on the appellants’ case, stated: “Professor Wintemute’s academic work played an important role in helping develop, and externally validating, the arguments that the Supreme Court eventually accepted” \[E\]. Lord Kerr quoted directly from Wintemute’s article \[6\], accepting the argument “that, from 1980 to 2003, Mr Walker had been paid the lower ‘gay wage’ \(one with no expectation that a survivor’s pension would ever be paid …\), rather than the higher ‘heterosexual wage’ \(one with an expectation that a survivor’s pension might be paid\)” \[F\]. If Mr Walker divorced his husband and married a woman, Innospec would pay her a pension of over GBP40,000 per year. The judgment gives financial security not only to Mr Walker’s husband but also to all same\-sex spouses or civil partners who are in a similar position. 

 **Marriage and civil partnerships** 

 <ins>Ensuring that bi\-national</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>same\-sex couples can legally live together in Europe</ins> 

 After being contacted by Arcigay, Italy's first and largest national gay organisation, Wintemute encouraged an unmarried same\-sex couple to challenge the anticipated refusal of a residence permit. At that time, foreign same\-sex partners of Italian citizens were not accorded any immigration rights to permit a family to live together in Italy. Italy had treated the applicants as an unmarried different\-sex couple \(who would be able to marry in Italy and thus obtain a residence permit\), even though, as a same\-sex couple, they were unable to marry. Wintemute became their legal representative at the ECtHR in the case *Taddeucci & McCall v Italy* \(2016\). Drawing on his research on indirect sexual orientation discrimination \[5\] and on same\-sex partner immigration \[2,3\], he persuaded the ECtHR to apply, for the first time outside the context of religious beliefs, its reasoning in an earlier case that discrimination may include “fail\[ure\] to treat differently persons whose situations are significantly different” \[G, p. 15\]. The ECtHR ruled that Italy's failure to provide any means for a same\-sex partner to qualify for a residence permit was discrimination based on sexual orientation. This judgment was the first ever by an international tribunal regarding the immigration rights of a same\-sex couple. 

 The judgment now benefits same\-sex partners from any country in the world who seek a residence permit in one of the 47 CoE countries on the basis of a relationship with a citizen. This avoided considerable suffering for many lesbian and gay couples who may have found themselves forced to live in separate countries. As the successful applicants Roberto Taddeucci and Doug McCall explained, “ *\[Wintemute’s\] legal strategy allowed us to stay together as a couple over the entire period and enjoy a life together with our wider Italian family … Because of our sexual orientations we were deemed not worthy of equal treatment by the Italian state. Professor Wintemute skilfully took our experiences to the Court who validated the discrimination. The result was incredibly empowering*” \[H\]. 

 <ins>Obliging Italy to create a new</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>alternative registration system for same\-sex couples</ins> 

 Wintemute drafted a third\-party intervention by ILGA\-Europe \(the European Region of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans & Intersex Association\) and other NGOs in *Oliari v Italy* \(2015\) \[J\]. This argued that European governments have an obligation to create an alternative registration system for same\-sex couples, who are excluded from marriage. Wintemute’s research\-based intervention not only demonstrated why a framework for recognition should exist as a human right, but also provided quantitative research on the number of CoE Member States where marriage or other forms of recognition existed. As Arpi Avetisyan, Head of Litigation at ILGA\-Europe, explained: “The third party intervention was extensively \(almost in its entirety\) cited and reflected in the judgment, which is very uncommon in Court’s practice. Remarkably, the Court delivered a positive judgment which very much read in line with our third party intervention drafted by Professor Wintemute” \[I\]. 

 The intervention helped to persuade the ECtHR that Article 8 of the ECHR imposes a positive obligation on Italy to create a ‘specific legal framework’ for same\-sex couples. The ECtHR devoted over eight pages of its judgment \[J, paras 134\-143\] to a summary of the research \[5\] and arguments presented in the intervention \(including Wintemute’s \[5\] above, cited at para 135\) regarding legal recognition of same\-sex couples in CoE countries and other democratic societies. The ECtHR reached the same conclusion in *Orlandi v Italy* \(2018, para 210\) with regard to same\-sex couples who had married outside Italy, after citing the intervention \(paras 172\-175\) \[K\]. 

 The 2015 *Oliari* judgment was followed by new laws recognising same\-sex couples in six countries: Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Monaco, Montenegro and San Marino. Avetisyan from ILGA\-Europe recognised the wide\-reaching impact of Wintemute’s contribution: “While the judgment itself has been a beacon in Court’s jurisprudence to pave the way for advancement of human rights of LGB persons, the research in Professor Wintemute’s brief has served as grounds for lawyers and policy makers to make arguments in their advocacy and litigation efforts at the national level *”* \[I\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Martini’s research in multimedia quality of service and experience has been adopted by: 

 Entryphone, a UK SME, through the creation of an innovative door intercom system. This led to additional cumulative sales of GBP412,000 between 2018 and 2019, projected to double annually, and a holistic embrace of future\-facing development leading to market share protection and expansion. 

 Deutsche Telekom \(DT\), a multinational company, through the integration of video streaming quality monitoring into its networks enabling the offer of cloud gaming services \- which contributed to an increase in revenue by 0.9%, to €5.7 billion, and gained 1,100,000 customers in Europe and 642,000 customers in Germany alone. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Modern technological advances and the proliferation of fast, cheap, and ubiquitous network access has enabled new services such as video streaming. Streaming may be directed to a range of devices \- laptops, phones, door entry systems. However, these services must meet stringent requirements in terms of network performance and capacity for end\-users, even when only low bandwidth is available. To ensure such requirements are met, Martini and her KU team, with long\-term contributions from Barman, undertook research on multimedia quality of service and experience \(QoE\). The research addressed the trade\-off between almost lossless compression and low available bandwidth, and assessment of QoE.Martini’s team evaluated the performance of seven video quality metrics for compressed medical ultrasound videos, finding that high efficiency video codecs reliably and suitably maintained visual information fidelity **\[R1\]**. Directing their focus to gaming video streaming, they met the need for application\-specific light\-weight models, using machine\-learning rather than knowledge of the original video sequence **\[R2\]**. They presented two no\-reference quality estimation models and evaluated their performances, showing improvements over current metrics and comparable accuracy with a full reference metric. Based on the properties of the human eye, Martini’s team have proposed an edge\-based reduced reference quality metric **\[R3\]**, whose results correlate well with both subjective observations and commonly used full\-reference metrics. This algorithm maintains fidelity, complexity, and low overheads, outperforming state\-of\-the\-art metrics. Later, they presented a new approach for quality evaluation when the reference video is not available for comparison **\[R4\]**. This almost\-blind quality metric achieved a high correlation with subjective results, and a negligible associated overhead. Martini has applied the use of these QoE metrics to wireless network, proposing a content\-aware packet scheduling approach **\[R5\]** and presenting an evaluated concept of quality switching for light field video **\[R6\]**. 

 This research work was conducted with the support of the EU, i.e. OPTIMIX \(FP7, 2008 – 2011\), innovative solutions enabling enhanced video streaming for point to multi\-point in an IP based wireless heterogeneous system, Qualinet \(COST, 2010 – 2014\), CONCERTO \(FP7, 2011 – 2015, Content and cOntext aware delivery for iNteraCtive multimedia healthcaRe applications\), and QoE\-NET \(Horizon2020, 2015 – 2018, innovative QoE maNagement in Emerging mulTimedia services\), EPSRC \(Iosire, 2017 – 2020\), Innovate UK \(Entryphone Ltd., Vocality International Ltd.\), other research councils, and industries \(e.g., DOCOMO, Siemens\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Kingston University’s \(KU\) research around live video streaming has led to impact in both a UK SME, Entryphone, and a multinational company, Deutsche Telekom AG \(DT\). 

 <ins>Entryphone: Developing a New Approach</ins> 

 In 2015 Entryphone, a UK manufacturer of door entry systems, entered into a 30\-month Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Kingston to deliver quality video streaming. They saw that for “ *long term prosperity it is essential our products \[are\] updated to be able to exploit the Internet of Things \(IoTs\) and mobile communication devices*.” **\[S1\]** Historically, door intercom systems have been analogue, and Entryphone was not taking advantage of solutions from the IoTs revolution, with the market for ‘traditional’ hard\-wired products shrinking. Customers demand new products that allow them to operate their door entry system with a smartphone. This is of particular importance for people with mobility and health issues and who cannot physically access their door entry system. Entryphone reported that the KTP addressed “ *The business opportunity in developing new systems that would function exploiting the wireless technologies but also work alongside our existing apparatus*.” **\[S1\]** The KTP led to existing product ranges having increasing compatibility with personal mobile IP devices and to non\-distributive upgrade paths, and to enhanced service contracts, thereby protecting and improving market share **\[S1\]**. Entryphone’s Director described the game\-changing contribution to Entryphone’s evolution saying *‘it was Kingston University who introduced us to using WebRTC, otherwise we wouldn’t have thought about it … I am happy we were able to move early to WebRTC rather than SIP, which is used by other market players at greater cost*” **\[S2\]**. 

 <ins>Entryphone: Developing Teledial</ins> 

 Based on research by Martini’s team, Entryphone developed a unique hybrid multi\-occupant visitor communication door control system combining traditional video door phone services \(analogue audio/video\) and IP services such as video and voice over IP using the H.264 codec. The hybrid approach introduced an effective interface, incorporated fail\-safe characteristics of the analogue system, and was cheaper for customers who do not have to replace their entire legacy analogue system **\[S3\]**. This has led to the commercialisation of two novel product ranges: Teledial \(GSM, audio only\) **\[S4\]** from 2018, and Teledial \(video, audio & video\) from 2019. 

 <ins>Entryphone: Economic Impact</ins> 

 Financial gains from additional sales were GBP32,000 in 2018 and GBP390,000 in 2019 and \(before Covid\-19\) projected cumulative sales were GBP900,000 by the end of July 2020 \(20% year\-on\-year increase\). The offer of new connected services has led customers to take out additional service contracts. The Director said the “ *Teledial GSM has been quite successful in terms of industry impact and \[Entryphone\] remain positive about the business impact it will have*”, adding “ *the Teledial unit retails for over £800, making a contribution to the company’s overall turnover as multiple systems are put into whole blocks of flats. We would not make other sales without this product; and we remain very confident that the initial financial predictions will eventually come to pass*. *Moreover, as digital solutions allow staff to remotely check many system functions, there are fewer visits by field service engineers, increasing both the speed of response to customers and the company’s profit margins’*” **\[S2\]**. The impact includes: 

-  internal development with “ *a growth factor in employee numbers, including an associate from the KTP and three out\-sourced sub\-contractor”*’ **\[S2\]**. 

-  the new mind\-set *“to transform the knowledge and culture of the company to prepare, secure, and expand \[the\] business to thrive in the decade ahead*” **\[S1\]** has already been enacted. All 24 members of staff had formal training to update their digital skills and knowledge, from detailed sales advice to new set\-ups and procedures. 

-  access to new markets such as schools, universities, hospitals, local authority housing, and larger new\-build developments is ensured, whilst protecting Entryphone’s position with multiple\-occupancy high\-rises. 

 <ins>Deutsche Telekom: Developing Metrics and Models</ins>With mobile operators believing that cloud gaming will represent up to 50% of 5G data traffic by 2022, quality cloud gaming operating in a low latency environment is a priority to DT. The need to ensure high quality service management led to a collaboration with Kingston University, as part of the H2020 QoE\-Net project, for facilitating smart monitoring of QoE. One in\-house researcher on the project commented that “ *Kingston University’s research was especially valuable in assessing compression\-quality trade\-offs and the creation of open\-source datasets and achieved three ITU recommendations \(G.1032, P.809, G.1072\)*” **\[S5\]**. The project leader defined the collaboration as ‘ *very fruitful’* and stated that *“The contributions to standardization will create real value for Deutsche Telekom that will be paying off in the next two years, as well as Cloud Gaming being ‘a significant use case for future* projects” **\[S6\]**. 

 <ins>Deutsche Telekom: Economic Impact</ins>The QoE\-NET project achieved the ‘ *development of metrics and models for objective quality assessment’ and will help ‘maintain DT’s competitive edge in the market*’ **\[S5\]**. By 2018, ‘ *some results of QoE\-Net \[*were *\]* *already effective in service management operation*’ **\[S6\]**. This adoption by DT has enabled it to offer cloud gaming services: in August 2018 DT added ‘StreamOn Gaming’ \(free for ‘Young rate plans’, €2.95 per month for over 27s\) to its existing music and video streaming service **\[S7\]**. To further support 4G and then 5G mobile multi\-player gaming, DT has built four new dedicated edge data centres. In 2018, this contributed to DT seeing its revenue increase by 0.9% to €5.7 billion and gaining 642,000 customers in Germany and 1,100,000 in Europe despite a very competitive telecommunication market. In 2019, a project lead at DT, described the market opportunity of cloud gaming and the need to ‘ *ensure that the game\-streaming traffic is delivered efficiently’* and at *‘the required gaming quality*’ **\[S8\]**. Thus, the research still contributes to DT, providing an edge in innovation, despite competition from Microsoft and Google. 

 <ins>Technological Impact</ins>While the early adopters of technology may suffer from the absence of technical standards, Martini’s contribution to international standards—ITU standard contributor **\[S9\]**, P3333 group on Standard for the Quality Assessment of 3D Displays, 3D Contents, and 3D Devices based on Human Factors \(key contributor of IEEE Standard P3333.1.2 **\[S10\]** and chair of IEEE Standard P3333.1.4—will enhance the longevity of the implemented video streaming technologies.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Technical capabilities developed for astrophysics and cosmology research at Oxford supported the growth of a start\-up company, Goonhilly Earth Station, from its birth to becoming a major player in the global satellite communications industry. This long\-term collaboration has supported job creation and secured UK participation in international commercial space projects and supported companies such as SES, Planet Labs and SpaceX. This same radio\-astronomy expertise that rejuvenated an aging satellite\-communications site in the UK was then put to use overseas in Africa and Mexico to create new jobs and foster a high\-technology science industry through training and technology transfer. The same team also collaborated with local industry in the UK, enabling a company \(Oxford Cryosystems\) to enter a new market that secured large long\-term contracts for their products \(including a GBP500,000 contract for the MeerKAT radio telescope\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 This case is based on the research programme in Experimental Radio Cosmology in Oxford Physics. The research is based on concepts of designing and building novel instruments and telescopes to answer fundamental questions in cosmology and astrophysics that cannot be addressed with existing common\-user facilities. Many of the underlying science goals are based in cosmology – the Cosmic Microwave Background \(CMB\), and the history of structure formation in the universe. 

 The main research activity has been the observation of the CMB at centimetre wavelengths: the measurement of its angular\-power spectrum in intensity and polarization, the detection of secondary anisotropies such as the Sunyaev\-Zel’dovich effect **\[1,2\]**, and more recently the characterisation of the Galactic foreground emission that hinders the precise measurement of CMB polarization **\[3\]**. The ultimate goal of these measurements is to understand the physics of inflation by detecting the signature of the primordial gravitational\-wave background, which is imprinted in the polarization of the CMB. 

 The development of the universe on large scales is also traced by the evolution of active galaxies, which contain supermassive black holes at their centres. These often evolve into powerful sources of radio emission, allowing them to be detected across the entire observable universe. Radio telescopes such as e\-MERLIN **\[4\]** and \(in the future\) the Square Kilometre Array \(SKA\), which combine high sensitivity with high angular resolution, are used to image the cores of these galaxies, and are able to distinguish, for example, between radio radiation generated directly because of the black hole and emission from the bursts of star formation that are also associated with active galaxies. 

 Our research programme required the development of techniques in very high\-sensitivity radio measurements, across the whole range of techniques in radio astronomy – design of antennas, cryogenic receivers, broadband signal\-processing systems both analogue and digital, and processing and analysis of the output data. The development of these techniques is itself also a significant area of research; Oxford has made state\-of\-the\-art developments in all these fields. For example, **\[5\]** describes the C\-Band All\-Sky Survey \(C\-BASS\), a project led by Oxford, in which two ex\-telecommunications antennas were modified to improve their performance, fitted with cryogenic receivers, and used to survey the sky at 5GHz to identify foreground emission contaminating the CMB. The instrument concept as well as all the key technical features of the instrument were designed and built in Oxford, which also manages the data\-analysis and science exploitation effort. 

 Due to this record in developing innovative experiments such as C\-BASS, Oxford Physics was selected by the Square Kilometre Array Organization \(SKAO\) to develop the main multi\-frequency cryogenic receiver package \(‘Band 3\-4\-5’\) for the SKA, the world’s largest radio telescope. The design required a high degree of innovation in cryogenic and Radio Frequency \(RF\) design to meet the requirements of sensitivity, power consumption and cost over the very large frequency range of 1.6 – 15.3GHz **\[6\]**.  Amongst many other science goals, this receiver will provide the SKA with one of its key science capabilities, the ability to resolve the pebble\-scale accretion in protoplanetary disks, complementing the ability of ALMA to image dust disks. SKA development has been funded by the UK Government with two explicit goals: to provide astronomers with the tools to make future discoveries, but also to provide UK industry with the opportunity both to construct components for the SKA and to benefit from the new technologies involved.

###  Supporting the formation and success of Goonhilly Earth Station 

 In 2008, Oxford Physics began working with an entrepreneur planning to acquire the Goonhilly Earth Station \(GES\) site. This site, owned by BT, was the largest commercial telecoms satellite ground station in the world and had been in operation since 1962. Due to the obsolescence of large dishes for global satellite communications and their replacement by sub\-sea optical cables, it was scheduled to be demolished until Oxford Physics intervened. The team at Oxford Physics realised that the antennas at Goonhilly had significant potential for radio\-astronomy research, for example, by adding them to the UK’s national radio\-astronomy facility, e\-MERLIN, which would double its resolution for deep multi\-wavelength studies of galaxy evolution. In addition, if fitted with C\-BASS\-style receivers, they could be used as single\-dish radio telescopes to complement Oxford’s CMB research. The entrepreneur became the GES CEO and planned a business model including the synergy between radio astronomy and commercial satellite\-communications technologies, benefitting from access to Oxford’s cutting\-edge radio\-astronomy technology. For example, cooled receivers, which provide much improved noise performance, are rarely used in communications due to their perceived complexity. Oxford Physics has extensive experience with their design, development and deployment and so would be able to build receivers for GES antennas that could be used for both commercial communications and research **\[5, 6\]**. Rawlings lobbied BT in 2008 to preserve the antennas from demolition and engage in efforts to re\-purpose the site **\[A\],** and plans for antennas based on Oxford’s research \(specifically the C\-BASS receiver and digital backend **\[5\]**\) were crucial to the viability of the business model funded in GES’s series B investment **\[B\]**. Goonhilly Earth Station \(GES\) CEO said: “ *The intervention from Professor Rawlings helped persuade BT to stop the demolition”* and *“the strong support from Oxford University in backing the concepts in our business plan assisted in us gaining our first successful venture finance series A funding of £3.8m \[GBP3,800,000\] in January 2014*.” **\[B\].** GES fully acquired the site from BT in 2014 and has grown from 6 employees \(headcount: 6; FTEs: 6\) in 2014 to 49 \(headcount: 49; FTEs 49\) in 2020. GES CEO continued: “ *A key part of our business plan is to develop a private global Deep Space Network. To allow us to be competitive, we have worked closely with Professor Jones and Professor Taylor in developing concepts for maintaining the required antenna performance with a lower\-cost, smaller aperture solution. Input from the university was critical in helping us to develop a business plan to attract our series B investment. In 2018, following the award of an £8.4m \[GBP8,400,000\] ESA contract to upgrade our largest 32m antenna for use in deep space communication, we successfully completed our series B investment with UK billionaire, Peter Hargreaves. The investment was worth £24m \[GBP24,000,000\]. Our close collaboration with Oxford University was an important factor in securing the deal.*” **\[B\]**. GES now provides spacecraft tracking services to many of the world’s largest satellite operators, GES CEO said: “ *We are now a major player in the global ground station business, supporting the operations of companies such as SES, Planet Labs and SpaceX, including the recent first privately\-operated crewed flight to the International Space Station”. “We provide services to all the world’s leading space operators, we are building the world’s first private global deep space network and we have a diverse and broadening portfolio in space systems consultancy, space AI and machine learning, high performance computing, space situational awareness, training, education and outreach. None of this transformation would have been possible without the outstanding and bold collaboration with Oxford University”.* 

 The Consortium of Universities for Goonhilly Astronomy \(CUGA\) \(Oxford, Manchester, Leeds, Herts, Durham and Central Lancashire\) coordinates research with GES. While other universities made cash contributions, Oxford Physics supplied a cryogenic receiver based on the C\-BASS project, allowing both radio astronomy and communications use. This was commissioned in 2019 and is now used by GES for UK Government contracts in space situational awareness **\[B\]**.   In July 2020, GES was awarded GBP1,700,000, via the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership \(LEP\), from the UK Government Getting Building Fund as part of a GBP3,770,000 project to invest in a production facility for cryogenic receivers for radio astronomy and communications \(the ‘Receiver Factory’\) **\[C\]**, directly based on research carried out in Oxford Physics for C\-BASS and SKA **\[B\]**. 

###  Enabling local industry 

 During the research and development stage of the cryogenic receiver for the C\-BASS Southern Sky survey **\[3,5\]** it became clear that a new, low\-power, low maintenance coldhead would need to be integrated into the system in order to allow long\-term operations at the remote desert site where observations were to take place. Existing solutions were not viable, but a market survey uncovered a potential solution from Oxford Cryosystems \(OCS\) which was being used in the field of X\-ray crystallography. Oxford Physics approached OCS, who were previously unaware of the applications of their equipment in radio astronomy, and from 2015 collaborated with OCS to successfully integrate OCS equipment into a research receiver \(for C\-BASS\), and recognize the potential application of OCS products to MeerKAT, a South African radio telescope with which Oxford Physics had long\-standing research links **\[3,6\].** This resulted in OCS winning a GBP500,000 contract to supply coldheads to MeerKAT, completed in 2018, with a further GBP100,000 contract in 2020. OCS Managing Director commented: *“During this work we retained close links with Prof Jones and his team, who provided invaluable insight into the requirements of a radio telescope receiver, technical information on temperatures and heat loads but also practical insight into radio frequency interference, operating conditions, power budgets and so forth”* **\[D\]**. OCS coldheads were then selected as the baseline for SKA in 2014. Based on this successful collaboration, in 2014 STFC funded Oxford Physics and OCS to develop a helium compressor for the SKA, combining their respective skills in radio instrumentation and cryogenics. OCS Managing Director commented said: “ *This collaborative effort over a period of over 10 years made it possible for the SKA cryogenics contract worth approximately €8 million \[EUR8,000,000\] to be awarded to the UK. We are in pole position to supply both coldheads and compressors to the SKA project.”* “ *Thanks to the research and collaboration with Profs Jones and Taylor and their team over this 10\-year period, Oxford Cryosystems has become a strong player in a completely new market… The relationship is…a shining example of how collaboration between academia and industry can be of great benefit to both parties, delivering substantial impact for the UK economy*” **\[D\]**. Since 2014, Oxford Physics has been developing the Band 3\-4\-5 receiver package for SKA **\[6\]**. Against strong competition from other countries, the UK has been conditionally allocated the construction contracts for this and the SKA cryogenics. The Head of the SKA Project at STFC said: “ *STFC’s support has enabled the University of Oxford to lead the UK’s interests in SKA MID Frequency Band 5 and MID Frequency Cryogenic Systems. This work is unique to the University of Oxford and no other UK university has played a role in these areas. This work has required the University of Oxford to work closely with UK Industry, the SKA Organisation \(SKAO\) and international partners, establishing strong collaborations from which UK research may benefit in the future. As a result of the research conducted at the University of Oxford, the UK has been conditionally allocated construction work to deliver both the SKA MID Band 5 Receivers and MID Cryogenic Systems for the MID Frequency Antennas. These contracts are estimated to be worth €11.6M \[EUR11,600,000\] and €8.5M \[EUR8,500,000\] respectively and are expected to be delivered by UK Industry. This represents approximately 17% of the construction work currently allocated to the UK and brings economic and societal return on the UK’s investment in the SKA*” **\[E\]**. 

###  Societal impact from fostering new technology and skills development overseas 

 Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy \(DARA\) is a Newton Fund project \(2015\) with Oxford, other UK universities and GES which uses radio astronomy as a vehicle for human capital development \(HCD\), developing high\-tech and business skills in the eight African countries that will host SKA antennas: Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. Oxford Physics taught a programme on radio telescope design and observations at an annual four\-week residential course based at the Hartebeestoek Observatory, South Africa. The course included lectures and practical workshops where the students learned the underpinning physics and techniques required to build and use radio astronomy receivers as well as data analysis techniques. The modules all drew upon Oxford’s recent research background and experience, in particular on the development of the SKA and CBASS receivers and the data analysis and science exploitation of the CBASS data **\[5, 6\]**. The DARA partner organisations have trained 140 students to date in radio astronomy, sharing technical and commercial expertise that inspires the students to boost economic growth by setting up their own businesses and passing on their knowledge and skills to the next generation. The Chair & Director of the Centre for Radio Astronomy Techniques & Technologies, Rhodes University, South Africa explained: “ *A key aim of DARA is to impart generic skills that have application beyond Radio Astronomy, and that are particularly relevant to the developing economies in Africa. Examples include data analytics, telecommunications systems, and digital and radio frequency electronics. This use of Astronomy as a platform for driving training and research in modern technologies is consistent with the strategy of the South African Department of Science and Innovation. Such initiatives are seen as essential to enable social development and economic sustainability in the context of Africa....Past students have returned to their home countries and have used the skills that they acquired to good effect at academic institutions and within industry*” **\[F\]**. One participant from Zambia who took part in the DARA training programme has graduated as an Environmental Engineer. As well as working in this capacity for large companies he has started a small consulting firm with some of his university classmates. The DARA experience inspired him to try and expand the services that his small business can offer by utilising remote sensing data from satellites. *""It is because of the knowledge that I acquired through the DARA training program that barely a few months after I completed the training I got a job. The DARA program introduced me to Agri Big Data which can help in decision making in agriculture and increase Zambia's agricultural productivity. Agri Big Data is an exciting program one which I believe holds the answer to agricultural success for the developing countries of the world especially in Africa""* **\[G\]**. The impact of the project was recognised by the Society of Satellite Professionals International \(SSPI\) with “The Better Satellite World Awards,” in 2018, recognising the space\-related project most likely to improve the world. 

 In a further Newton Fund HCD project with the Instituto de Radioastronomía y Astrofísica \(UNAM\) and the Mexican state of Hidalgo, Oxford Physics has provided the design of the receiver equipment \(based on the C\-BASS project\) as part of a project to upgrade a satellite\- ground\-station antenna for modern radio astronomy. The converted antenna is a centrepiece of Hidalgo’s strategy to shift their economy from mining to science\-based industry **\[H\]** and the Tulancingo Radio Observatory is one of three laboratories forming the core of a strategic plan to position Hidalgo as a national leader in space\-related science, technology and innovation **\[I\]**. The company Centro de Ingeniería y Desarrollo Industrial \(CIDESI\) benefitted from the collaboration with Oxford Physics, as the Head of Laboratory for Radio Astronomy Instrumentation at UNAM explained: *“Perhaps most significant was the development of human resources, as the engineering staff of CIDESI became acquainted with the special and demanding needs of the radio astronomy community for precise and reliable drive systems and antenna controls. Although CIDESI was already quite skilled in this area, their experience with the Oxford group served to develop their contacts with the academic/scientific community, beyond the manufacturing community that they generally serve. Their new\-found expertise has permitted them to contract for services at state universities within Mexico which operate small radio telescopes, not only providing an essential support service to the universities but also generating multiple contracts for CIDESI at the level of \[GBP10,000 to GBP20,000\]”*. The primary contractor involved in the antenna conversion has also benefitted from the new experience gained on steerable antennas and is now able to seek similar contracts across Latin America. The Head of Laboratory for Radio Astronomy Instrumentation at UNAM commented: “ *The transfer of these skills, developed in the research environment of Oxford, has had an extensive and diverse impact within Mexico… The State of Hidalgo and various subcontractors within Mexico have also directly benefitted from the Oxford radio group's involvement in Mexico…* *The radio observatory forms the foundation of the Hidalgo effort to attract high\-tech industries to the state and to become the national leader in space technologies”* **\[I\]**.

#  2. Underpinning research 

###  Ground\-breaking interdisciplinary research led by LUMS accounting faculty \(Young\) and uniting colleagues from computer science \(Rayson\), corpus linguistics \(El\-Haj\), and financial reporting \(Walker at Manchester University and Athanasakou at Saint Mary’s University Halifax, Canada\) has analysed qualitative \(text\-based\) corporate disclosures using natural language processing \(NLP\) and artificial intelligence \(AI\). 

###  The volume of information disclosed by large companies has grown dramatically over the past two decades. For example, the length of an annual report published by a typical London Stock Exchange\-listed company increased from 47 pages \(14,954 words\) in 2003 to 74 pages \(33,193 words\) in 2016 \[R1\]. These disclosures provide commentary on strategy, risk, corporate governance arrangements, and broader social welfare matters including emissions, gender pay, employee welfare, and human rights in supply chains. The majority of these disclosures are unstructured text, meaning that the content, position and format of the commentary in the document vary dramatically across firms and over time. 

###  With tens of thousands of complex corporate disclosures published annually, demand for automated methods to help filter content and improve decision\-making is high. Several structural factors inhibit progress. First, inconsistent document structure and content makes automatic retrieval and classification of textual data extremely challenging. Second, many reports are published as PDF files, which restricts the ability to extract and manipulate content because most of the metadata in the original source file is lost on conversion to PDF. Third, progress necessitates interdisciplinary teams with expertise in computing, linguistics, and financial markets. However, technical barriers to entry reinforced by discipline silos thwarts collaborations between researchers in these diverse fields. Academic progress in the field has therefore been limited, which in turn undermines regulatory efforts to improve corporate transparency. 

###  The research began in December 2012 with a project to develop methods for text retrieval and classification \[G1\]. The initial focus was UK PDF annual reports because these documents are the centrepiece of the annual corporate reporting cycle. The research team’s contribution was the CFIE \(Corporate Financial Information Environment\) app. The app extracts annual report text and classifies content into generic categories \(e.g., Chair’s Statement, Governance Statement, Remuneration Report\) to support time\-series and cross\-sectional analysis. Articles published in accounting and computer science \[R2, R3\] describe the method and resources to support academic research \(e.g.,  [report scores](https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/researchdata/296) and  [financial corpora](https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/researchdata/271) for >25,000 UK annual reports\). Accuracy rates for retrieval exceed 90% and for classification performance are >95% for key report sections. In addition to academic colleagues, various financial market stakeholders have leveraged these resources including the CFA UK \[G4\], \[text removed for publication\] \[G5\], \[text removed for publication\] \[G6\]. The research team has also developed methods for analysing other document types including annual earnings announcements \[R3\]. 

###  In subsequent work, the CFIE app was used to measure corporate reporting quality in terms of what management say \(content\) and how they say it \(language\) \[G2\-G6\]. The team use AI to isolate the properties of award\-winning annual reports and then incorporate these features into a model that scores report quality out\-of\-sample. Findings reveal that language accessibility \(more relevancy markers, greater connectivity, more exclusive language forms, and fewer grammatical words\) combined with more information on value creation distinguish award\-winning reports. A model incorporating these features predicts future winners with 75% accuracy and now informs IR Society rankings \[R4\]. The team also develop and test AI models for scoring optimism and causal reasoning at the sentence level. The AI models are able to replicate reading performed by a human with accuracy rates of up to 80% \[R3\]. An output of the research is  [the provision of resources](https://github.com/apmoore1/pea_classification) to assist automatic text scoring. 

 In related work, Young et al study corporate policy and transparency on workforce rewards, skills, and engagement using a combination of manual and automatic methods to evaluate reporting practices. Part of this work reflects requests from industry bodies including PLSA \[G3\] and CFA UK \[G4\] to evaluate and promote best practice \[R5, R6\]. Key findings include evidence that executive compensation contracts for FTSE 350 firms rely on measures of performance that promote short\-term decision\-making, and that a high fraction of FTSE 100 firms fall short of best practice guidance in many areas of workforce reporting.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Process from the Research to the Impact 

 Initial work developed the CFIE app plus other text retrieval and classification procedures. Subsequent research applied NLP and AI methods to score corporate reporting quality on a range of dimensions. The following examples of impact involve retrieval and classification tools, NLP and AI\-derived quality scores, or a combination of both. 

##  Description of the Impact 

 **Detecting false and misleading financial statements** \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Fostering high\-quality financial reporting and governance** \(\[text removed for publication\], IR Society, CFA UK & PLSA\) \(period of impact: between 2016 and 2020\) 

 Transparent reporting and progressive governance underpin the integrity of UK business and financial markets. The IR Society plays an important influencer role in the development of UK corporate reporting best practice by raising the standard of investor communications and recognising best\-in\-class performance \(the society has over 850 members from the UK, Europe and beyond, including representatives from most of the FTSE 350\). The work is helping the IR Society, which is the UK leader in investor relations, to improve the quality of UK annual reporting \[R4\]. The IR Society uses the AI reporting quality model outlined in \[R4\] to inform its annual Best Practice Awards in Annual Reporting. As the IR Society CEO explains, “ *The annual report quality model developed by the research team is transforming how we approach the task of identifying superior annual reporting. In particular, using scoring methods based on artificial intelligence is enabling us to complement our traditional self\-nomination procedure with a broader proactive screening approach. The result is a 900% increase in reports \(from approximately 30 to 300\) that we are able to consider at no incremental cost to our organisation*” \[S2\]. 

 LUMS methods and data also feature in influential reports aimed at improving corporate governance practices. For example, CFA UK\-commissioned work on the link between CEO pay outcomes and the transparency of executive pay reporting \[G4 & R5\] was featured in press coverage with an estimated reach of 9,016,541 \[S3\] and used by CFA UK in seminars \(13 January 2015, 18 January 2017, & 4 May 2017\) with institutional shareholders and stakeholder representatives to promote the importance of linking pay to measures of long\-term value creation. Following the seminars, the research formed the centrepiece of CFA UK’s response \(February 2017\) to the UK Government’s Corporate Governance Reform green paper \(November 2016\) \[S4\]. 

 Similarly, the PLSA, representing 1,300 pension schemes with GBP1 trillion in assets under management, commissioned an evaluation of FTSE 100 companies’ workforce policies and reporting \[G3\]. The final report \[R6\] highlights deficiencies in current reporting practices. The report was the centrepiece of a PLSA stakeholder engagement event \(28 September 2018\) and was cited widely in the business press with an estimated reach of 2,879,565 \[S5\]. Conclusions formed a central pillar of the PLSA response \(February 2018\) \[S6\] to the \[text removed for publication\] Consultation on a revised UK Corporate Governance Code \(December 2017\). The \[text removed for publication\] cites the research in its follow\-up January 2020 project report \[S7\] and \[text removed for publication\] \[S8\]. 

 The research team have also worked closely with the \[text removed for publication\] to promote an evidence\-based approach to financial reporting regulation. The research \[G5 & R2\] has helped \[text removed for publication\] evaluate compliance with its reporting guidance. Analysis of compliance with \[text removed for publication\] guidelines on the use of alternative performance measures highlighted areas where compliance is weak, as well as specific companies with opaque reporting practices that the \[text removed for publication\] \[S9\]. Analysis using methods and data from \[R2\] and \[R3\] also formed the basis for a report on preliminary earnings announcements discussed at 2 \[text removed for publication\] meetings about regulation in this area \[S10\(a\)\]. \[text removed for publication\] \[S10\(b\)\]. 

 **Promoting text processing in the asset management industry** \(period of impact: between 2018 and 2020\) 

 Fidelity International is one of the world’s largest asset management firms, serving >2.4 million clients globally and managing assets exceeding GBP300 billion. Reporting complexity is forcing companies like Fidelity to seek automated solutions to support their investment strategies. Fidelity used datasets from the CFIE app \[R1\] as a benchmark for developing and testing its own tools for analysing global corporate disclosures. As their Senior Data Scientist states, “ *We searched globally for commercial and academic solutions to help process large volumes of unstructured annual report automatically… The approach described in El\-Haj et al. \(2019\) is pioneering. Based on our search, we concluded that no other option came remotely close to the functionality of CFIE app*” \[S11\]. 

 \[text removed for publication\] \[S11\]. 

 The quantitative analysis team at RPMI Railpen is also working with Young \(G7\) following his presentation on semantic tagging and topic modelling \(R4\) at Wolfe Research’s 2nd Annual QES European Quant and Macro Investing  [Conference](https://d12m9erqbesehq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/22756/2019/06/13140233/2019-QES-London-Agenda1.pdf) \(17 Jun 2019\). RPMI is responsible for investing circa GBP30 billion on behalf of the Railways Pension Scheme’s 350,000 members \(one of the UK’s largest and longest established pension funds\). The work, which is subject to a confidentiality agreement, involves modelling topics and analysing management commentary \[R3, R4\] to create text\-based investment signals. RPMI’s Investment Director \(Alternative Risk Premia\) confirms that, “ *NLP insights and resources from LUMS research are informing development work in a material way*” \[S12\]. 

 Finally, Young’s work is also influencing the investment community through training.  [INQUIRE UK](https://www.inquire.org.uk/) &  [Europe](https://www.inquire-europe.org/) invited Young to present an overview of \[R1, R2, R3\] at their 2019 Spring Residential  [Seminar](https://www.inquire-europe.org/uploads/files/spring-2019-residential-conference--provisional-programme.pdf) involving approx. 60 asset managers and quantitative analysts. The demand for further information on applying NLP and AI methods led INQUIRE UK to collaborate with Young to deliver a  [training programme](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/introduction-to-textual-analysis-and-natural-language-processing-workshop-registration-123648151951?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reminder_attendees_48hour_email&utm_term=eventname&ref=eemaileventremind) \(five sessions; 15 hours\) on textual analysis in financial markets to investment professionals from leading financial institutions \(BlackRock, UBS, BofA Securities, Fidelity, Jupiter Asset Management, FTSE and MSCI\). INQUIRE UK’s Chairman views the training as an important step towards a wider appreciation of NLP methods among investment professionals in the UK. He also confirms that the novel training collaboration has influenced INQUIRE’s broader strategy for delivering value to its members in the future \[S13\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Diversity and Inclusivity by Design \(d\+iD\) is a collaborative research project, which embeds diversity and inclusivity research in the creative spaces of art and design through co\-design methods. Conceived and led by **Dr Anastasios Maragiannis**, the research has reached over half a million people through a program of events \(2016\-2020\) that include research outputs showcased international exhibitions including the London Design Festival \(LDF\) and the Cyprus High Commission \(CHC\). The research has informed and shaped diversity and inclusion policy in governmental and non\-governmental refugee and cultural organisations in Cyprus, Greece, Africa and the UK, transforming creative practice for young refugees and socio\-economic migrants. Within North\-West Europe, the research has supported vulnerable young people to increase skills and confidence. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Established in 2016 by **Dr Anastasios Maragiannis**, University of Greenwich \(UoG\), the *Diversity and Inclusivity by Design* \(d\+iD\) project **\[3.1\]** explores the question: “What is enabled when designers design with and for others?”. Findings from d\+iD show that co\-design with users \- specifically within the design development process \- ensures that results meet these end users’ needs. Co\-design ensures better understanding and knowledge of user or stakeholder requirements; improved solutions; and cross\-disciplinary collaboration. 

 **Maragiannis**’ research project challenged conventional approaches, which often view design as a process and product of an individual expert. He recognised early on, the need to identify and address the concerns of design practitioners regarding the efficacy of co\-design methods. The perspectives he encountered have included: the view that co\-design could be disruptive to the designer’s progress; could potentially create disorder in planning and execution and is therefore time\-consuming; and the view that co\-design is limited in its scope and what it can achieve. **Maragiannis** demonstrated that the merits of co\-design outweigh any perceived disadvantages. 

 His novel research established that co\-design positively engages marginalised groups to amplify, mobilise and diversify design practices and discourse. The d\+iD research **\[3.1\]** has shown that by using a co\-design approach, design can act inclusively regardless of gender, disability, ethnicity, language or age, and can therefore, be used as a powerful tool to create positive social impact and change. The project has made it its aim to re\-imagine and alter the way that design is approached, and to make diversity and inclusivity a central aspect of co\-design methods. The research innovation of the d\+iD project has been to successfully use co\-design methodologies to co\-create with marginalised groups in order to give them a voice and empower them **\[3.1\]**. 

 **Maragiannis**’ is the co\-design lead for a €4.28M majority EU funded \(alongside other funders\) project to lead a team to develop a co\-design methodology to tackle labour market exclusion, engaging those not in education, employment or training \(NEET\). To make a real difference, they transferred knowledge across regions in Europe to generate an innovative, inclusive, transnational model. This model provided NEETs with the necessary essential support \(in North West Europe\) while responding to the specificities of local/regional contexts and NEETs’ individual needs and goals **\[3.2\]**. 

 Inspired by the limited understanding and choices around aesthetics and personalisation in wearables, **Maragiannis** explored how technology could be used to empower individuals in a variety of contexts; to improve our way of living in the world, through a number of contextual resources and practice\-research, which were devised and conducted to address women’s concerns and preferences on wearable technologies. He evidenced that a very important factor in the development of wearables was the social and cultural connotations of these devices and how they then portray women **\[3.3\]**. 

 The d\+iD research team is comprised of scholars, designers and artists; and collaborates with FABRICA Research Centre \(Italy\), AIGA \(USA\), Greek Forum of Refugees \(GFR\), the Cyprus High Commission \(CHC\) and the Greenwich Autistic Society \(UK\). This cross\-disciplinary research culminated in co\-design discourse and practice, public exhibitions, workshops and panel discussions. The project has focused on developing a dialogue amongst industry experts, scholars, artists, designers and the public for the opportunity to create a multicultural and multidisciplinary exchange of ideas **\[3.1\]**. 

 The d\+iD research project has recently achieved global recognition by a UNESCO partner organisation, the prestigious International Institute of Information Design Award **\[3.a\]**, and also won the Interreg North West Europe ""IMPACT AWARD"" in Lille \(Dec 2019\) with over 90 EU funded projects entries **\[3.b\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Social exclusion is a complex and multi\-dimensional process. It involves the lack or denial of resources, rights, goods and services, and the inability to participate in the normal relationships and activities, available to the majority of people in a society, whether in economic, social, cultural or political arenas. It affects both the quality of life of individuals and the equity and cohesion of society as a whole. 

 Since its 2016 inception, the d\+iD project has influenced designers, changed international cultural policies and perceptions, improved the lives of marginalised communities and the social welfare, employment and education of vulnerable young people. The d\+iD research has shown that by using a co\-design approach, design can act inclusively regardless of gender, disability, ethnicity, language or age, and can therefore, be used as a powerful tool to create positive social impact and change. 

 **Influencing creative practice and reaching new audiences** 

 **Maragiannis’** research, in collaboration with refugees and people living with visible and non\-visible disabilities in the UK and abroad, influenced diversity in the arts and improved the understanding of co\-design approaches for two international cultural departments and four NGOs and research centres from four countries \(Italy, Greece, USA, Cyprus\). From 2016 onwards, the d\+iD team have been incorporating their research findings into commissioned public exhibitions and collaborations, as well as international forums, workshops and lectures. In September 2017, the team curated an exhibition that took part in the London Design Festival \(LDF\); an event with an estimated audience of 420,000, with 24% being overseas **\[5.1\]**. The exhibition worked in collaboration with FABRICA Research Centre \(IT\), AIGA \(USA\), the Greek Forum of Refugees \(GFR\), the Greenwich Autistic Society \(UK\) and was partially funded in kind by Exonera and Ecoluxe London. The LDF 2017 *“Diversity and inclusivity by design”* exhibition offered 15 diverse and inclusive inter\-disciplinary projects. A series of public events accompanied the exhibition, including talks and public workshops. This exhibition brought communities together, raised awareness within organisations about the importance of considering diversity and inclusivity and inspired new creative practice. 

 For example, the exhibition led Graphics and Digital Designer, Alexandros Kosmidis from *‘forpeople’* to develop a design project named “UNbuffer”, to explore the buffer zone that has divided Cyprus's island for more than five decades. The Green Line is essentially a ceasefire line, patrolled by the UN peacekeeping force and constituting constant reminder and remainder of the conflict. The project raised awareness, introduced new artistic expression forms, and led to several high\-profile international awards in 2019/20 **\[5.2\]**. Alexandros Kosmidis said: “ *My participation in the d\+iD research project empowered me to collaborate with public arts venues, artists and programming professionals to produce new forms of artistic expression. The d\+iD research generated new ways of thinking that influence my creative practice, artistic quality, and audience reach.”  \[5.2\]**. 

 Furthermore, in December 2018, as a result of the exhibition, Maragiannis was invited 

 to contribute to Econsultancy’s best practice guide on Neurodiversity and Digital Inclusivity **\[5.3\]**. **Maragiannis** co\-developed these inclusivity guidelines to help businesses start addressing the needs of neurodivergent individuals. At least 10% of potential customers may be won and lost over the issue of accessibility and inclusion. The guide, using **Maragiannis’** research, supported organisations with good practice in employment, product design and marketing and is available to over 600,000 professionals every month **\[5.3\]**. 

 **Policy changes to support economic migrants and refugees** 

 The d\+iD project influenced and initiated policy change in two organisations involving economic migrants and refugees. The research collaboration with the GFR and the High Commission of the Republic of Cyprus \(CHC\) were significant in serving communities who often feel disenfranchised and forgotten. 

 In Jan 2019, the CHC and the Cultural Section commissioned the team to devise and co\-design themes of diversity and inclusivity with a group of London\-based Cypriot designers, and to explore how these ideas could be used as vehicles of design within the context of immigration and economic expatriation. The ensuing d\+iD *“Empower Individuals”* exhibition at the LDF 2019 highlighted social and political issues, consumerism, gender issues and conflict. The Festival welcomed a record\-breaking 600,000 individual visitors from over 75 countries **\[5.4\]**. 

 Subsequently, in June 2019, the CHC Cultural Section \(CS\) commissioned the d\+iD team to co\-develop their first ever cultural and arts policy.  **Maragiannis’** research was instrumental in the development of the CHC’s CS “Equality, Diversity and Inclusion” policy in the Creative Arts, Design and Education”. The focus of this policy was the empowerment of individuals and the engagement of diverse participants. The collaboration led to valuable outcomes, as the new policy is now mandatory in their creative projects/participation and application processes. The policy has been influential in their decision to create new projects which will focus on more inclusive outcomes. Dr Marios Psaras, Cultural Counsellor, CHC said: “ *The project has enabled us to support diverse collectives and individuals, including youth groups, LGBTQ\+ artists and projects, female leaders in the arts and culture, and ethnic minorities*… *\[the\] diversity and inclusivity by design research project has made an invaluable contribution to our evidence\-based approach and has been instrumental in our work*. *”  \[5.5\]**. 

 The GFR found that the research outputs of the exhibition d\+iD *“Empower Individuals”* exhibition covered issues relevant to their own cultural program. As a result, in March 2019, the GFR invited the team to devise the *“Creative Citizens of Europe”* exhibition in Athens, which investigated ways to engage refugees through design and the arts. The exhibition motivated the GFR to reflect on current processes and develop a new framework and organisational policy that considered inclusion and integration of refugees in society through the arts. This led to **Maragiannis** developing an “Equality, Diversity and Inclusion” policy for them to empower people through Creative Arts, Design, Education and Sports”. This policy has been used to raise awareness of GFR’s creative activities and has positively impacted and increased participation in their activities. Furthermore, their engagement with **Maragiannis’** research has also enhanced GFR’s policy and practice for securing diverse project proposals, for example the MATCH social inclusion opportunities project which is a Collaborative Partnerships project co\-funded by the Erasmus\+ programme. This project has enhanced social inclusion and equal opportunities for 800 refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and disadvantaged young local people by fostering and increasing participation in sport activities **\[5.6\]**. Jean Didier Totow, President, GFR stated: *“Since 2018, \[the policy\] has been a key part of our Equality, Diversity and Inclusion strand where we have reached out to underrepresented and marginalised groups to sell the benefits of participation. The project has enabled us to support community groups.”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 **Maragiannis’** research has also led to a collaboration with Africa Risk Consulting \(ARC\), a pan\-African consulting company which provides information and advice that enables its clients to take informed investment decisions and to safeguard their reputations. ARC’s client base includes several development financial institutes which place a huge emphasis on diversity and inclusion in the supply chain of the work they commission. Consequently, ARC consulted **Maragiannis** and his team to seek to embed d\+iD in their outward presentation and processes to meet this specific requirement. This collaboration has been instrumental in their approach to recruitment and their focus on the diversity and inclusion aspects of participation. They also use it as a core means to raise awareness of how ARC aspires to work in Francophone countries where they are gaining in prominence notably in the West African currency zone of Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Togo and Senegal and the Central African zone of Gabon, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tara O’Connor, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Africa Risk Consulting \(ARC\) Ltd said *“d\+iD research has influenced our decision\-making and has helped us to ‘sell the benefits’ to ARC’s database \[of\] 3,000 political, academic and business contacts across the continent and in the Africa\-linked world.”* **\[5.7\]**. 

 **Empowering marginalised groups** 

 Since 2016, the weekly Design Roast Open Lecture Series, an annual event, with 40 sessions, has made diversity and inclusivity by design its focal point **\[5.8\]**. Approximately 2,500 people have attended in person and online and it has established itself as an important platform that engages the design community and diverse communities. 

 Ecoluxe London, an organisation promoting eco\-sustainable fashion and, in particular, 

 supporting diverse and marginalised communities adopted the Design Roast lectures as part of their training and broader reach to diverse communities' networks. The lectures challenged and inspired the entire Ecoluxe community and beyond. Stamo Ampatielou, Director, Ecoluxe said; *“we work with young women from Northern Africa, and as part of our process, we used the lecture series to empower them…an economic refugee young woman from Africa with no access to education, mentioned that the series helped her build confidence and consider options that she never thought she could do before. \[She\] has now left an abusive marriage and is able to provide for her young family in Greece.”* **\[5.9\]**. 

 **Improving the social welfare, employment and education of vulnerable young people** 

 In North West Europe \(NWE\), 14% of young people aged 15\-34 years are not in employment, education, or training \(NEET\). Vulnerable young people can be irresponsive to classic top\-down approaches and often do not connect to existing support schemes which bears the risk of long\-term labour market exclusion. The d\+iD project collaborated with EYES \(Empowering Youth through Entrepreneurial Skills\) who are a European partnership of municipalities, regional governments, social services and universities. They encourage young people who are in a vulnerable position to \(re\)gain control of their own life. **Maragiannis’** is the co\-design lead for the EYES project and his d\+iD research methodology is used to develop the project outputs. This included the co\-development of an App that that can be jointly used by vulnerable young people and their coaches which puts them in touch with local organisations and training providers. In addition, **Maragiannis** and his team co\-developed training materials for professional and volunteer coaches and guidance for the local implementation of the EYES approach. The project outputs also included training labs which prepare coaches to run the pilots in the Ruhr area, Greater London, Flemish triangle, European Metropolis of Lille, and Tilburg. Dr Jürgen Born, Chair of EYES said *“The project has enabled us to involve and support different communities professionals, and diverse young people from North\-West European cities to develop engaging ways to increase skills and confidence. The project generates new ways of thinking that influence creative practice or its audience reach. Through its co\-design methodologies and diversity and inclusivity by design research methods the University of Greenwich has contributed to inspiring, co\-creating and supporting new forms of social expression.”* **\[5.10\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Bithell’s research into the natural voice movement and global singing traditions generated new knowledge, understanding and methodologies that have impacted on professional and creative practice. Beneficiaries of the research include: i\) an international network of 700\+ choir directors, whose practice has been elevated, enriched and expanded; and ii\) thousands of amateur singers and performers of world music, who have experienced technical improvement and new forms of intercultural engagement. Key pathways to impact included: i\) professional development accessed via a monograph, CPD events and online resources; and ii\) voice workshops, festival plenaries and advisory work that engaged a wider public. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The research comprises three interrelated projects. The first focused on multipart singing in Corsica, the subject of Bithell’s first monograph \( *Transported by Song*, 2007\). The second examined the natural voice movement and its intersection with multipart singing in world oral traditions, culminating in a second monograph \( *A Different Voice*, 2014\). The third investigated multipart singing in Georgia \(Caucasus\). Further outputs from these projects include book chapters and refereed journal articles. The research led to new findings in three key areas: 

 **a\) Explication of a new socio\-musical movement:** Bithell’s is the first investigation of the natural voice movement. *A Different Voice* \[1\] broke new ground by theorising the evolution, philosophy and methodologies of the Natural Voice Network \(NVN: naturalvoice.net\), whose members are committed to making singing accessible to all through non\-auditioned choirs where songs from diverse cultures are taught by ear. In examining how this network of 700\+ practitioners in the UK and beyond became a pioneering force for musical democratisation, the research revealed the emancipatory potential of an inclusive alternative to mainstream choral practice – one that challenged assumptions about musical competency in Western societies and enabled tens of thousands of aspiring singers who do not read music, and so are excluded from most choirs, to access the health and wellbeing benefits derived from singing. In answering the core question of why songs from the oral traditions of ‘other’ cultures provided the lynchpin for this movement, the research also identified a set of alternative techniques and skills that enabled practitioners without classical training to become effective choir leaders. 

 **b\) Insights into multipart singing in traditional societies:** Bithell conducted first\-hand, intensive research into musical repertoires and practices in Corsica and Georgia \[2, 3, 4\], both identified as preeminent sites where a unique heritage of polyphonic songs continued to be practised as part of a living tradition yet was under\-researched. In each place, she worked with professional ensembles, cultural organisations and national institutions, alongside researching regional and village\-based traditions. The research produced new insights into song repertoires and singing style, the functions and aesthetics of collective music\-making, contemporary modes of transmission, culturally\-informed understandings of the rewards of singing, and the role of singing in building and sustaining healthy communities. 

 **c\) Understanding singing as a vehicle for intercultural encounters:** Bithell’s research into interactions between native culture\-bearers and student\-singers from diverse parts of the world included participant\-observation in international summer camps, study tours, festivals and workshops \(including some curated by Giving Voice and Village Harmony: see §4\), interviews with teachers, hosts and participants, and close analysis of teaching styles and learning modes. Her findings reframe the often negatively loaded debate around cultural appropriation by highlighting the humanistic potential of singing encounters that transcend geographical and linguistic borders and by revealing the mutual benefits of cultural exchange \[1, 3, 5\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The underpinning research addressed a need for a deeper understanding of the history of the natural voice movement, the efficacy of its methods, and the dynamics of singing traditions in world cultures. Close collaboration with NVN members informed the direction of the research as it unfolded. The research also involved engagement with two other bodies espousing similar principles and practices: i\) Giving Voice, a project of the world\-leading Centre for Performance Research \(thecpr.org.uk\), is devoted to exploring the world’s vocal traditions and developing vocal practice. Its 2\-to\-3\-week\-long festivals bring together performers, teachers and participants from across the world \(average weekly attendance: 50 presenters and performers, 700 day\-workshop participants, 1,000 audience members\). ii\) Village Harmony \(villageharmony.org\), a US\-based association, produces singing camps and study tours in partnership with local teachers in different countries. Its mission is to provide ‘ *authentic cross\-cultural musical immersions for amateur and professional singers in the US and around the globe*’ \(average participants per annum: 1,600\) \[I\]. *A Different Voice* \[1\], whose companion website hosts extensive multimedia materials, including performance videos and links to songbooks, had impact in its own right as a resource that directly informs practice \(610 hard copies sold; open access since September 2020; eBook also part of electronic subscription packages\). Follow\-on activity building on the wider corpus of research outlined in §2 included bespoke CPD training, public workshops, plenaries at international festivals, and the preparation of new digital resources for the NVN website. Bithell’s appointment to the NVN’s Board of Trustees in January 2018 was an endorsement of the value accorded to her expertise. This position – later consolidated by her election as Chair – enabled her to develop further resources and practical interventions and play a key role in defining future directions. 

 The research helped extend the reach and influence of the NVN itself \[A\]. By March 2020, the NVN had 732 members, up from 468 in December 2013 \(just before the book’s publication\). The majority are in the UK but 12% are now spread across the world. Through the NVN alone, the research/impact has reached practitioners in continental Europe, North and South America, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand, alongside the UK and Ireland. Some UK\-based members also regularly work overseas. As detailed on the NVN website, members typically run three or more weekly choirs, often supplemented by weekend workshops and educational or outreach projects \(some dedicated to refugees or homeless people, or those in hospitals, care homes or prisons\). Through their work, the impact of Bithell’s contribution through \[1\], CPD training and the online resources she has compiled extends to tens of thousands of amateur singers. The research has also reached hundreds of participants in workshops, festivals and singing camps, including those organised by Giving Voice and Village Harmony. Further details of reach and significance pertaining to beneficiaries feature in the sections that follow, which also include representative quotes from the sources listed in §5. 

##  1. Providing professional development, influencing practice and expanding capacity 

 **A Different Voice:** The book was enthusiastically received by NVN members, who praised its *‘accessible’* style and spoke of how it *‘affirmed’*, *‘validated’*, *‘empowered’*, *‘inspired’* and *‘enriched’* \[B, C, D\]. Many reported buying extra copies to give to others and encouraging both colleagues and choir members to read it \[A, B, C, E\]. Readers testified to how it endorsed and contextualised their own work, raised its status, lent weight to funding applications and advocacy, and increased their confidence, self\-esteem, pride and resolve: *‘It was an exciting and powerful affirmation of who I am’*; *‘Caroline’s book helped me understand better why I do what I do, and how it works, and why it is so effective and powerful’*; *‘This book gave me confidence to stand up more easily for this way of working – I have seen a change over the last 4 years in how this type of choir is valued’*; *‘It really imbues confidence when talking about the work, especially in medical or non\-arts settings’*; *‘It’s great to say to funders – here’s a book about this work\!’* \[B, C, D\]. One choir leader promoted the book on a blog \(1,998 views\) as a resource that *‘answers all your questions’* \[F\]. NVN president Frankie Armstrong credits *A Different Voice* with playing *‘an important part in enriching and deepening the practices of the network’* and bringing in *‘new people from more diverse backgrounds’* \[A\]. She promotes it on the NVN website as *‘essential reading for anyone interested in the development of the Network and community music...and the what, why and how of song’* \[F\], and writes: *‘I'd quite like to...insist that reading this book is a necessary qualification for being a member\!’* \[A\]. The book has enabled founder members to appreciate their own role in a radical socio\-cultural shift. For one, it was a revelation to realise that she had been part of *‘a movement that has fundamentally changed the way that community singing happens...what we do...is life\-changing for the people we work with as well as for ourselves’*; reading the book *‘reaffirmed the purpose of what I’m doing...reignited the spark…and boosted my confidence’* \[B\]. 

 Others attest to how the research brings together the histories and practices of the NVN in a way that makes them accessible and usable, whilst also providing scientific support for their work by synthesising research in other fields \(e.g. music and the brain\) and applying this to the NVN ethos and method \[A, C, D\]. The book is valued for the way it *‘allows and encourages debate’* and helps people reach a more informed understanding: *‘We can say: “Read the sections on that, it might help you think about it”’* \[E\]. One singing leader appreciated *‘the book's unravelling of complex issues I have struggled with about the use of songs from different cultures...how to honour your sources, and encourage your groups to see music as an open door into other worlds’* \[D\]. Another affirmed that it *‘acted as a stimulus for me to examine my own assumptions about songs in the NVN repertoire and encouraged me to find out more’* \[C\]. One reported: *‘A documentary maker is making a film about my activist choir and I found the book a really useful reference to articulate my thoughts’* \[D\]. 

 The book launched some readers on a new career path. Its *‘profound impact’* led one choral conductor from Chile to relocate to the UK to research community choirs under Bithell’s supervision on the MusM Ethnomusicology at The University of Manchester. After participating in Bithell’s training and other NVN events, she returned to Chile to pioneer NV choirs there: *‘I am starting something new that nobody else is doing here in Chile...I am passing on to other choir directors...the new knowledge and techniques I acquired through Caroline's work and my introduction to the NVN, in a way that has a positive influence on their own professional work and the experience of their choir members’* \[G\]. The book also alerted readers to other histories, giving *‘a clearer sense of being part of a very varied and rich tapestry of other projects and strands of development’* \[D\]. Giving Voice director Joan Mills highlights how the book *‘demonstrates and explains the importance of opportunities for exchange and interaction between organisations: it shows very clearly what can happen when you share knowledge and there is a cross\-fertilisation between people who have similar ideas and visions, yet sometimes located within very different contexts’* \[E\]. 

 **CPD workshops:** Workshops available to NVN members most often focus on learning songs which they can then teach to their choirs. Bithell’s contribution is unique: she provides specialist knowledge grounded in her scholarly training and direct experience of diverse musical cultures, presented in a style that participants find *‘accessible’*, *‘informative’*, *‘inspiring’* and *‘intriguing’* \[C, H\]. Her contributions to the NVN’s 3\-day Annual Gatherings have ranged from workshops for 30 people to plenary sessions for 150 \[H\]. These were complemented in 2018–2020 by a variety of other events, including bespoke study days in Manchester \(8 delegates from London, Edinburgh, Midlands and North West\) and Cardiff \(22 delegates from across Wales\) \[H\] and workshops for other projects/organisations \(see below\); further study days planned for 2020 were postponed due to COVID\-19 but will be rescheduled when circumstances allow. Participants gained new insights into the cultural contexts of specific repertoires, together with practical techniques and theoretical frameworks designed to enrich the ways in which songs are taught and performed; they also received resource packs to support the implementation of their new skills and knowledge \[H\]. Feedback testifies to how the workshops/study days changed understanding, increased confidence and influenced practice in ways that extend the impact to participants’ choir members, *‘provid*\[ing\] *firm foundations for our practice and ensuring we work in a respectful and authentic relationship with other cultures’* \[C\]. Respondents gained a *‘deeper understanding of* \[the\] *role of singing other than entertainment/commercial/ performance’*, a *‘better understanding of strategies to research/find research on the background of songs’* and a *‘greater ability to embody a song through an increased sense of empathy and connectedness’*. Some reported feeling *‘more empowered to teach this kind of material’*; others were inspired to *‘encourage more vocal freedom...and experiment with timbres with the choir members’* or to pursue *‘application of songs for life events \(end\-of\-life, transitions, coming of age, celebrations, grief and lament\)’* \[H\]. 

 **Online resources:** In addition to the resources on the website for *A Different Voice* \[F\], Bithell has assembled a substantial body of resources for the members’ area of the NVN website \[F\]. This now acts as a gateway to hundreds of pages of text\-based materials and thousands of hours of listening and viewing, with links to research reports on the benefits of singing, briefings and toolkits, themed playlists, world and folk music documentaries providing accessible cultural context, and a collection of bespoke teaching demonstration videos \(many filmed by Bithell herself\). One member sums up the usefulness of this massive new resource: *‘Ideas for warm ups, for when I’m feeling a bit uninspired. Videos of other teachers teaching a song and reflecting upon their methods to help self reflect and keep my practice good. Having accessible at the touch of a button recordings and information from so many musical traditions is a real support to being able to present songs knowledgably. Working freelance can be lonely: these resources are an inspiration’* \[C\]. The demonstration videos have added value for overseas members: *‘With the videos the language barrier is not so much of a problem...All of that material is very helpful, especially for those of us who are very far away and want to set up a choir with the philosophy of the NVN’* \[G\]. \(NVN video views March–December 2020: 4,743\) 

##  2. Enhancing community music\-making, creative practice and cultural understanding 

 **Amateur choirs and connected communities:** Through the extensive network of choirs led by NVN members, the trickle\-down impact of Bithell’s research reaches thousands of amateur singers in the form of stylistic or technical improvement, enriched cultural understanding, and increased confidence and wellbeing. Ways in which these benefits are channelled through the professional development undertaken by choir leaders have already been noted. Users of the research testify in particular to its positive influence on how they teach songs from different cultures: *‘We have a deeper understanding of how the songs belong in their home culture and how they are sung. I can draw on this information when I’m teaching my own choir so that it is done as respectfully as possible, and being able to pass on knowledge of that particular culture means that I am helping to widen people’s understanding of the world’* \[C\]. Impacts have extended to more innovative ways of working, leading some to change how they design concerts or singing holidays, or to experiment with new kinds of community events that bring neighbourhoods together around singing. One described how *A Different Voice* led her *‘to try and make my concerts and choir rehearsals an experience of collective joy, and to try and do it deliberately, because I know why I’m doing it, and to have the techniques to be able to do it’* \[C\]. Another was prompted to rethink her approach to the singing holidays she leads in Morocco and to create opportunities to exchange songs with local people: *‘There’s something much deeper in terms of communication and connection that happens when we have that kind of exchange and Caroline’s book provided an important impetus for developing this more reciprocal approach’* \[B\]. This practitioner also works with war veterans and people in care homes and hospitals and values the book as an affirmation of *‘the importance of the role of singing work in creating alternative positive realities for people... What Caroline has written is highly political...because it’s about the change that can happen’* \[B\]. 

 **Voice workshops, festivals and intercultural encounters:** Choir members and other singers \(both amateur and professional\) have encountered Bithell’s research directly through attending her voice workshops and plenary talks at festivals. Through these events, her impact on vocal practices, participatory music\-making, cultural awareness and theoretical understanding has reached a more diverse demographic, including performers of world music, members of transnational singing networks, and participants in intercultural summer camps. Her plenary talk at the 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Giving Voice Festival \(UK, 2015; week\-long event with around 800 attendees\) elaborated key findings from \[1\] as part of *‘taking stock of how much we had come to know, understand, recognise and feel about the voice in performance’* and *‘stimulated many areas of discussion’* \[E\]. Her plenary at VoicEncounters in Poland, a two\-week event co\-produced by Giving Voice and the Grotowski Institute as part of Wroclaw’s European Capital of Culture celebrations in 2016 \(average daily attendance 350\), addressed the theme of traditional vocal forms and skills as sources of experiment, transformation and inspiration for the performer \[F\]. These presentations to singers, actors and voice trainers from across the world, joined by local audiences, have enriched practice, reinforced synergies between different communities of practice and raised public awareness. More specifically, Giving Voice director Joan Mills writes: *‘her research and very practical exploration of* \[Georgian\] *singing has been extremely helpful for choirs throughout the UK and within the Giving Voice project... because Caroline has been able to create a “bridge” between Georgian ethnomusicological research and those who may have no academic aims but participate in Georgian singing...for pleasure. These choirs and their leaders now have access to much more detailed understanding of the songs and culture at a level that is appropriate for beginners as well as those who have a much deeper level of expertise’* \[E\]. 

 Bithell’s Corsican and Georgian research has also benefitted hundreds of singers associated with Village Harmony. Co\-director Patty Cuyler identifies \[2\] as ‘ *the only book I urge participants to read*’ as preparation for the singing camps in Corsica and \[3\] as ‘ *top of my reading list for our Georgian music courses*’ \[I\]. Cuyler included several other publications by Bithell in the resources for the 2020 online Corsican singing course, at which Bithell also gave a talk providing cultural and historical context \[F\]. Among the 50\+ attendees from North America, Europe, South Africa and New Zealand were several choral directors who planned to share their learning with singers and colleagues in their home networks \[I\]. Bithell also worked with singers new to Georgian and Corsican traditions at the 2020 Narberth A Cappella Voice Festival \(approximately 400 attendees\) \[F\] and during a 2018 residency in Brazil, where she also gave a one\-day workshop on the natural\-voice method \(part of Unicamp’s Local Musicking project: 60 participants\) \[F\]. In Georgia, she introduced natural\-voice practices and Corsican songs to around 250 singers, music educators and folklorists at a series of workshops and talks \(2014–18\) \[F\]. 

 Alongside interviews for the podcasts SingSing \(188 downloads\) and Harmony UK \(441 plays\), her research reached a wider public through her contributions as interviewee/consultant to documentaries on Georgian and Corsican music for BBC Radio 4 and Deutsche Welle \[F\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 QUB in collaboration with Wrightbus have developed best in class low and zero emissions technologies, and played a key role in decarbonizing UK and international public transport.  Since 2014, 1000 QUB technology driven powertrains have continued to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 250,000 per year on London bus routes alone.  Powertrain modelling and lifecycle modelling research at QUB has played an integral role in the recent GBP66,000,000 investment by Translink for 100 low emission battery electric and hydrogen vehicles, and pioneering research by the newly renamed QUB Bamford Technology Centre continues to lead the way along the road to zero. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 QUB has a distinguished track record in engine simulation. The focus has broadened from modelling conventional internal combustion engines in the mid\-1990s to modelling the complete powertrain system in recent years.  Powertrain simulation is complicated by the large number of rapid variations in parameters over a typical drive cycle. Much research effort has been invested at QUB over the last 20 years to construct accurate models with a strong physical basis.  This has been underpinned through state\-of\-the\-art engine test cells to characterise performance over complete drive cycles, which has established confidence in models through a research culture of rigorous experimental validation. 

 In 2005, a collaborative research project began with Wrightbus to develop modelling architectures for full hybrid powertrains \[Douglas\].  This work focussed on the construction of high\-fidelity models of key system components, including batteries, motors and inverters.  These models were integrated into design tools and extensively tested and validated against drive cycle data from testing at Millbrook facilities.  This validated modelling capability was a breakthrough step in the design of hybrid vehicle powertrains, which for the first time delivered a tool to predict the instantaneous state of the engine in response to variations in system design and component selection This was foundational for the development of the hybrid powertrain for the ‘New Bus for London \[Douglas\].  Previous modelling methods relied heavily on global or averaged system characteristics, such as total fuel consumption over a fixed driving extent, and had limited ability to account for rapid fluctuations in powertrain inputs, which typify conditions experienced on urban routes.  The QUB team achieved a breakthrough with the capability to replicate rapid transients in powertrain inputs and responses by the physical modelling of individual components. 

 Building on these successes and the challenges of the Next Generation Hybrid Electric Vehicle and its increased complexity, the QUB team focused on simulation flexibility \[ **R1:** Early, Kee\]. New modelling approaches were developed to allow changes to system configuration to be evaluated rapidly, allowing greater potential of the hybrid systems to be realised for fuel and emissions reductions \[ **R2, R3:** Early, Cunningham, Douglas\]. This work was supported through the Innovate UK Low Emission Vehicle Systems programme \(IDP13, Douglas, Early\) and resulted in Low Carbon Vehicle certificates being awarded to both the single and double deck variants of the HEV\-96V bus \(shown below\). 



 Alongside fundamental powertrain research, QUB has led in the development of accurate lifecycle models \[ **R4**: Soban, Smyth\] \[ **R5**: Douglas, Early\].  These tools allow accurate comparisons to be made between alternative powertrain technologies, in terms of ownership costs, running costs and lifecycle emissions to achieve commercially viable, low carbon solutions that will be adopted by fleet operators. 

 This collaboration has resulted in the formation of the GBP5,000,000 Sir William Wright Technology Centre \(W\-TECH\) \[Douglas\], launched by the Commissioner for Transport for London, Mike Brown, in 2017, and recently renamed the Bamford Technology Centre after the successful takeover of Wrightbus in 2020.  This is the world’s first technical centre of excellence solely focussed on public bus technology, and has become a focal point for future technologies within the sector.  This encompasses research in future driveline development, advanced control systems, vehicle light\-weighting and structural design, thermal and lifecycle analysis as well as bus safety.  The centre works with partners internationally, recently concluding work in conjunction with Kowloon Motor Bus Company \(KMB\) on safety aspects of advanced driver assistance systems \[ **R6**: Douglas, Early\]. 

 In 2019, the Centre embarked on the Next Generation Electric Vehicle programme \(IDP14, Douglas, Early, Cunningham\), funded by Innovate UK.  This builds directly on the modelling expertise retained in the Centre \[ **R1\- R6**\], where development work is continuing to develop the first UK produced fully electric powertrain.  Increasingly, the lifecycle modelling work carried out by QUB \[ **R4**: Soban, Smyth\] \[ **R5**: Douglas, Early\] forms an integral part in public transport policy making, identifying routes which offer the maximum advantages in terms of fuel economy, emissions and environmental impact.  Most recently \(December 2020\), Wrightbus and QUB \[Douglas, Early\] have been successful in gaining funding from the Advanced Propulsion Centre for an Advanced Route to Market Demonstrator fuel cell electric vehicle, due to launch in September 2021.  The Centre continues to lead the way in rapidly bringing novel, advanced low and zero emission drivetrain technology from academic research to market.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Air quality is a major public health concern, particularly in built up urban areas, and recent years have seen the expansion of the number of low emission zones throughout the UK, as well as the introduction of an ultra\-low emission zone in central London.  In the “Road to Zero” strategy document, the UK government has laid out its ambition for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040, as well as schemes to encourage low emission public transport.  Buses play a vital role in reducing emissions; one double\-deck bus can potentially replace 75 cars.  In inner cities, the stop/start conditions and slower speeds mean that older diesel vehicles in particular can emit significant levels of local pollutants. 

 Hybrid electric vehicle architectures are key in this transition to ultra\-low and ultimately zero emissions solutions.  Building on over 20 years of powertrain modelling research, Queen’s University Belfast have developed advanced hybrid powertrain modelling technology which is integral to thousands of low emission hybrid vehicles currently in service around the world. 

 In collaboration with Wrightbus, Queen’s University began work on developing state of the art system modelling approaches for hybrid vehicles on the development of the New Bus for London powertrain.  Director of Engineering for Wrightbus, states *“This modelling work was key in enabling us to meet extremely demanding technical specifications, and the direct result of this research was a best in class system in terms of fuel economy and exhaust emissions.  Subsequently Wrightbus won the contract to supply 1000 buses of this type to Transport for London, commencing in 2012"".   \[ **S1**\] 

 The success of the London Bus project led directly to the GBP3,200,000 Innovate UK funded project “Next Generation Hybrid Bus” \(NextGenHEV\).  This project led to further innovations in powertrain system modelling, with the evolution of flexible systems modelling architectures which enabled rapid evaluation of candidate hybrid vehicle systems and components.  Director of Engineering for Wrightbus states that *“This modelling architecture has been integral to the development of our flagship hybrid electric vehicles, the StreetLite and StreetDeck Next Generation Hybrid buses, supporting the design of the overall system configuration, component sizing, as well as the “on vehicle” control system”.   \[ **S1**\] 

 The driveline development ultimately led to both the single deck \(StreetLite\) and double deck \(StreetDeck\) variants being certified to low carbon emission bus status by the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership \[ **S2\-S4**\].  This certification confirms the achievement of a 35% well\-to\-wheel greenhouse gas saving in comparison to the Euro V diesel engine baseline; this equates to a saving of 25,000 kg of equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> per year for a single average London Bus.  Additionally, the “StreetDeck” double decker variant of the next generation hybrid bus has been awarded an Ultralow Emission Bus Certificate, with similar status pending for the single deck version.  In competitive benchmark testing, the double decker StreetDeck bus achieved 15% better fuel economy than its nearest rival \[ **S4**\], with the single deck variant, the StreetLite, achieving a 6% improvement \[ **S3**\].  Although it is an early stage in the lifetime of this next generation vehicle, Wrightbus have already sold over 100 HEV single and double deck vehicles as a direct result of this partnership with Queen’s University.  These vehicles are currently carrying thousands of passengers daily on a number of high\-profile routes in Oxford and London \[ **S1, S5**\]. 

 Beyond the UK, the hybrid powertrain system & design approaches developed during the Next Generation Hybrid Bus project have opened up new opportunities to export this technology internationally.  Wrightbus received a breakthrough order for 5 StreetDeck for Monterrey City, Mexico, which entered service in 2017, which marked the first introduction of Euro 6 standard vehicles in Latin America \[ **S1, S6**\].  Recently Wrightbus have secured a series of multi\-million pound orders for Hong Kong to deliver 584 vehicles over a two\-year period; significantly this included a further 50 StreetDeck buses, which is the first time that Wrightbus integral powertrain vehicles have been delivered to this long standing customer \[ **S1**, **S6**\]. 

 Alongside the research and development effort on hybrid powertrains, the research carried out by Queen’s on full vehicle lifecycle models has been another key enabling factor in exploiting these potential export opportunities \[ **S1, S6**\].  Account Manager for Wrightbus International explains, *“These tools are now key components in our decision making process.. this equips us with the ability to offer bespoke, commercially viable low carbon transport solutions to international transport operators”.* \[ **S1, S6**\].   Queen’s University have used this lifecycle modelling work, alongside in\-service fleet monitoring, to support a number of tender processes, including in Santiago Chile and Canberra Australia.  As an example of the implementation of these tools, Account Manager for Wrightbus International explains: *“Recently we have developed a customised StreetDeck bus for Santiago Chile, where the technology represents huge potential savings in carbon emissions and harmful pollutants in comparison to the city’s predominantly Euro 2 and Euro 3 bus fleets”.  \[ **S1, S6**\].  According to European Emissions standards, a Euro 6 rated engine produces 92% lower NOx emissions than its Euro 3 predecessor, highlighting the transformative effect this technology can have on air quality in built up urban environments as soon as the bus starts rolling.  Account Manager for Wrightbus International comments further on the importance of these technology milestones on potential future exports: *“Set against a backdrop of increasing concerns about pollution and its implications on health and global warming, these are hugely significant developments for Wrightbus, which are expected to yield new international orders for the company of between £10,000,000 and £15,000,000. This represents an important stream of exports for the local economy, as well as building the company’s brand value overseas.”  \[ **S1, S6**\]. 

 Capitalising on this hugely successful collaborative research relationship, the GBP5,000,000 Sir William Wright Technology Centre \(W\-TECH\) was formally launched in 2017.  This has directly resulted in the generation of 8 high value postdoctoral research and development jobs. The Centre has attracted leading researchers from across the globe, including secondments for engineers from some of the world’s largest public transport operators, including Kowloon Motor Bus \(KWB\) in Hong Kong \[ **S1, S7**\].  Renamed as the Bamford Technology Centre following Wrightbus’ change of ownership in 2020, building on the modelling skills and experience retained at QUB.  The powertrain and lifecycle modelling research is increasingly being implemented by public bodies in their decision making process relating to decarbonising public transport.  Most recently, this modelling methodology played an instrumental role in Translink’s decision to invest GBP66,000,000 in a fleet of 80 battery vehicle and 20 Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, along with supporting infrastructure \[ **S1, S8**\].  The Centre continues to ensure that the UK leads the way in driving technology towards zero net emission for public transport.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease \(DOHaD\) Centre at the University of Southampton has made key discoveries demonstrating that the diet and lifestyle of pregnant mothers can have a critical impact on the long\-term health of their children. The research has shown that epigenetic processes underlie the mechanism of transmission of disease risk, which can be mitigated by changes in lifestyle, and has transformed inter\-governmental, government and non\-government organisation health policies in the UK and internationally. It has led to wide uptake of new guidelines for clinical practice, including e\-learning platforms for healthcare professionals used by 89,000 people around the world. Southampton researchers pioneered the hospital\-based science education programme *LifeLab*, engaging 11,500 teenagers and 334 teachers from 72 schools and motivating them, as evidenced by clinical trial data, to improve their own health and that of future generations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The conditions within the womb have a lasting effect on a child’s life. Known as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease \(DOHaD\) concept, research has shown that exposure to certain environment influences at critical periods of development and growth will have significant consequences for the individual’s short and longer\-term health. Two pioneering Southampton longitudinal cohort studies have been fundamental in the establishment of the DOHaD concept: the Hertfordshire Cohort Study \(active since 1989\) was a retrospective study of adults and includes continuing long\-term follow up and the Southampton Women’s Survey \(active since 1998\) was the first large scale prospective study of women and their children starting before conception. Together these have provided a unique view of how early life exposures establish disease risk, particularly of non\-communicable diseases \(NCDs\), across the life\-course and across generations. 

 Research at Southampton since 2000 has seen the DOHaD field take significant strides forward and its impact has been felt on clinical practice and health policy around the world. In 2003, the International DOHaD Society was established by Professors Mark Hanson, Keith Godfrey and Cyrus Cooper, with an opening address by HRH The Princess Royal; it now has 1,000 members from 50 countries and a dedicated academic journal. Southampton research utilised human cohorts and animal models to identify modifiable early life risk factors, especially before they demonstrated the role of epigenetic processes in the underlying mechanisms of transmission of such risk. Southampton studies caused a major revision of the concept that NCDs are predominantly a combination of inherited fixed genetic risk and unhealthy adult lifestyle, with the realisation that a substantial proportion of NCD risk is not explained by these factors at the population level. Their discovery of epigenetic mechanisms opened new avenues for early prediction and intervention to reduce risk of later NCDs. They demonstrated the important contribution of early life epigenetic changes, related to aspects of maternal diet, lifestyle or adiposity in relation to a range of childhood risk factors for later NCDs in the next generation. These include: childhood adiposity \[ **3.1**\]; a measure of arterial stiffness which relates to cardiovascular function \[ **3.2**\]; and bone density which relates to peak bone mass attained in young adulthood \[ **3.3**\] – all risk factors for later NCDs. The epigenetic marks \(particularly DNA methylation\) are mechanistically important; the Southampton team has shown functionality in the DOHaD lab, taking their ongoing epidemiological cohort studies beyond correlation to causality. The work has highlighted the transmission of risk from parents to offspring by non\-genetic biological and social factors, with particular focus on the preconception and pregnancy phases of the life\-course. Animal studies demonstrated for the first time that epigenetic processes induced in early development by unbalanced maternal diet can be prevented \[ **3.4**\]. The team subsequently showed in animals that risk can be transmitted by both maternal and paternal lines and can be induced even in the early embryo, creating awareness of the importance of the preconception environment \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Studies demonstrating mechanisms underlying potential reversibility of NCD risk for the next generation supported the Southampton approach of taking continued epidemiological cohort studies beyond correlation to causality and to pioneering interventions through new randomised controlled trials \(RCTs\). MAVIDOS is the first major RCT of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy, following the finding in the Southampton Women’s Survey that 35% of women in the city are vitamin D insufficient \[ **3.6**\]. Based on this basic and clinical research, the DOHaD Centre has conducted qualitative research to explore how these new concepts can inform health policy, particularly in the prevention of childhood obesity and the application of life\-course concepts underlying DOHaD. Hanson and Cooper served or chaired World Health Organisation \(WHO\) technical and policy meetings to develop the application and measurement of the life\-course concept in health policy for member states.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 University of Southampton research has shown that the environment experienced in the womb, and at conception, can have profound consequences on the long\-term health of a person including the risk of obesity and NCDs. This has had a direct impact on intergovernmental, government and NGO health policy, clinical practice and health literacy in the UK and around the world. 

 **Impact on intergovernmental, government and NGO health policy** 

 According to WHO \[ **5.1**\], the research of Hanson, Godfrey, Cooper and colleagues ‘ *has led to recommendations by WHO in relation to the prevention of childhood obesity, through the ECHO \(End ChildHood Obesity\) Commission and also the Nurturing Care Framework, both of which have been adopted by the World Health Assembly and are now having an effect on government nutritional policy in many countries*’. Specifically, this policy impact at WHO and UN level involved: 

-  Influencing the WHO Guideline on Improving Early Child Development \(March 2020\) \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  Informing the UN’s Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health 2016\-2030 \(published 2015\); DOHaD research by Hanson and Cooper cited on page 103 \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  ‘Catalysing’ the WHO\-coordinated, 10\-year, multi\-country Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative, which is examining the effect of preconception health on markers of metabolic health. \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  Co\-chairing \(Hanson\), of the Working Group on Science and Evidence for WHO’s ECHO Commission. The resulting implementation plan was adopted at the World Health Assembly in 2017, which mandated 194 member states to adopt the plan \[ **5.1**\]. 

-  Introducing the concept of ‘nurturing care’ to promote healthy development across the first 1000 days of life through a co\-authored \(Hanson\) paper in The Lancet \(2017\). The paper underpinned WHO’s Nurturing Care Framework, which was adopted at the World Health Assembly in 2018, again mandating 194 member states to adopt the framework \[ **5.2**\]. 

-  Authoring \(Cooper and Hanson\) the WHO Health Evidence Network report \(2019\): *What quantitative and qualitative methods have been developed to measure the implementation of a life\-course approach in public health policies at the national level?* \[ **5.3**\] 

-  Chairing \(Hanson\) international expert meetings at WHO on the effects of environmental toxicants on development in June 2016 and Nov 2017, which led to the new initiative *Don’t Pollute My Future\! The impact of the environment on children’s health* \[ **5.4**\]. 

-  Informing the WHO\-UNICEF\-The Lancet Commission *A Future for the World’s Children* March 2020 \(paper by Cooper and Hanson cited on page 651\) \[ **5.5**\]. 

 DOHaD research also influenced policy development and debates in the UK. Due to Southampton’s ground\-breaking findings on the effect of maternal diet and lifestyle on offspring health, Hanson was invited by the UK’s Chief Medical Officer to author a chapter on preconception health for her 2014 Annual Report \[ **5.6**\]. For the first time, this report focused on the importance of the preconception environment, making recommendations for greater continuity of health care to reduce transmission of NCD risk across generations and focussing on the most vulnerable sections of the population. In 2018, Hanson made a significant contribution to the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology POSTnote *The Ageing Process and Health* \(No. 571, Feb. 2018\), which emphasises DOHaD \(papers by Hanson and Godfrey both cited\) \[ **5.7**\]. Godfrey’s work on preconception health was cited in a House of Lords debate in April 2018 that was called in order to challenge the Government on the steps it was taking to address childhood obesity \[ **5.8**\]. 

 Their research and involvement in policy formulation at an international level led Hanson and Godfrey, in 2019, to establish the first Preconception Partnership, a group of leading epidemiologists, scientists and clinical academics. It proposed an annual ‘report card’ to measure progress in improving a set of preconception health markers. The report card uses metrics from data sources such as the Maternity Services Dataset and the Sexual and Reproductive Health Activity Dataset, and is designed to hold governments to account. As a result, Public Health England \(PHE\) updated their policies on preconception care to identify opportunities for intervention, and issued resources to primary and secondary care trusts detailing the available interventions \[ **5.9**\]. PHE also made an unprecedented move to release national maternity and newborn data to Southampton researchers to assess against the report card. 

 **Impact on clinical awareness and practice** 

 University of Southampton research demonstrating the importance of nutrition before conception and during the first 1000 days of life led Godfrey and colleagues to initiate eLearning platforms to educate the healthcare workforce, in both low\-middle and high income settings. The aim was to impact real\-world healthcare practice in early nutrition at scale. The eLearning programmes in Early Life Nutrition have been developed and distributed to healthcare professionals and young couples in areas such as Africa, Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia. Collectively the platforms have more than 89,000 registered users. \[ **5.10**\] 

 With DFID funding, the team developed an eLearning programme for management of malnutrition. Their evaluation in Ghana, Guatemala and El Salvador for 2015\-2017 showed it cut mortality rates from severe acute malnutrition from 5.8% to 1.9% \(difference \-4.0% \(95% CI \-6.7 to \-1.8\), p<0.001\). The malnutrition eLearning course improved knowledge, understanding and skills of health professionals in the diagnosis and management of children with severe acute malnutrition, and changes in clinical practice and confidence were reported following the completion of the course \[ **5.10**\]. Based on WHO guidelines, the course has been taken by 17,000 health professionals, trainees and educators in 120 countries \[ **5.10**\]. It has improved clinical practices in hospitals and community settings in Ghana which has seen an improvement in mortality rate as demonstrated by a director of the district health directorate, who said: “rehabilitation rate has increased from about 80% to about 95%. And the mortality rate … has decreased to about 50% of what we used to see before the training.” \[ **5.11**\] 

 Southampton research on nutrition in the adolescent, preconception and maternal periods and on transgenerational passage of NCD risk led directly to mutliple guidelines \[ **5.12**\] developed by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics \(FIGO\), which represents national professional organisations in 130 countries. The *Think Nutrition First* guideline was chaired by Hanson and launched in 2016 at FIGO World Congress in Vancouver, attended by 5,000 delegates. The FIGO Global Declaration on Hyperglycemia in Pregnancy, co\-chaired by Hanson, was launched at the Congress in Rio de Janiero in 2018, attended by 11,500 delegates. The guidelines were disseminated to 132 Obs and Gynae professional societies globally and translated into several languages. In 2020, Hanson led the development of the Pregnancy Obesity and Nutrition Initiative under the Pregnancy and NCDs Committee at FIGO, which published guidelines on obesity management before, during and after pregnancy. This led to a clinical nutrition checklist being developed for healthcare professionals to assess pregnant women’s diets and identify any nutritional risk in early pregnancy. Early analysis of its use in Hong Kong showed that among the 156 women who used the checklist, 95% had nutritional issues identified. \[ **5.12**\] 

 **Increasing health literacy and inspiring positive lifestyle changes among teenagers** 

 The research on nutrition in adolescence and the importance of the preconception environment to the transmission of NCD risk to the next generation led Hanson, Godfrey and colleagues to develop a purpose\-built teaching laboratory, *LifeLab*, at  Southampton General Hospital to educate school students about how their current health and life choices affect the health of their future children. LifeLab is a structured education programme over a two\-week period. It comprises: a professional development day for science teachers; pre\-visit lessons at school; an immersive, hands\-on visit to the LifeLab facility; follow\-up lessons at school; and a celebration event for all LifeLab students, parents, local health professionals and public officials. 

 The facility was formally launched in 2014. Since then, 11,591school pupils and 342 teachers from 66 schools have participated in the programme \[ **5.13**\]. Schools embed the programme into their science curriculum for Years 8 and 9; it is designed to be linked into several work strands and referred back to over the year. Southampton’s RCT of LifeLab \[ **5.14**\] demonstrated that, prior to participation, 50% of teenagers had an above average score, whereas 12 months after participation the proportion increased to 61% \(adjusted difference between groups = 0.27 SDs \(95%CI=0.12, 0.42\)\). Students also judged their own lifestyles more critically, with fewer reporting their behaviours as healthy \(53.4%\) compared to the control group \(59.5%\) \(adjusted PRR=0.94 \[0.87, 1.01\]\). Additionally, they had greater understanding than control students of the influences of health behaviours on their long\-term health and that of their children; for example, they knew that our nutrition starts to affect our future health before we are born \(p <0.001\) and the food a father eats before having a baby will affect the health of his children \(p<0.001\). 

 Qualitative data \[ **5.15**\] also demonstrated the profound impact that LifeLab has had on the health literacy of students. Representative feedback included: “ *If we change our lifestyle, we can more than halve our chance of getting an illness later on in life”*; *“Eating unhealthy is not only bad for your health but your child's also”*; *“How unhealthy my lifestyle actually is and the small changes that need to be made just to make sure I'm at less of a risk”*; *“I’ve eaten less fatty foods and seen how it could actually affect it \[my health\], before I thought I could just change it and it would all be better, but it can actually affect it long\-term as well*”. There is evidence of the programme inspiring students to consider future careers relating to science and health, and changing perceptions of science as an academic discipline. Representative feedback included: “ *I found them \(the scientists\) really inspirational and am now considering going into nursing or medical care*”; *“They \(the scientists\) made me change my mind about what I went to be when I am older”*. 

 According to the CEO of University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, LifeLab has contributed directly to meeting this aspect of the Trust’s vision: ‘ *We will play our part in the fight to improve population health working with the University of Southampton on their world\-renowned research demonstrating how lifestyle and behaviour not only impacts on an individual’s health but that of future generations* \[ **5.16**\].’ LifeLab resources form part of the Royal Society for Public Health \(RSPH\)\-accredited Level 2 Young Health Champions qualification. LifeLab was awarded RSPH centre status in 2017 and in 2019 won the RSPH national *Centre for Excellence* Hygeia Award \[ **5.17**\]. It was a key part of BBC Horizon episode *Why are we getting so fat?* \(2016\) \[ **5.18**\] which was watched by 1.82m people and was the 11th highest\-rated BBC2 programme that week.

###  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Under the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan, personalised care is the driving force behind seeking more effective partnerships between local voluntary and healthcare sectors, with further recommendations for the private sector around employment and well\-being. Tallant’s research on the nature of trust has enabled these sectors in Nottingham and Nottinghamshire to strengthen their ability to deliver joined\-up, community\-based services that meet the increasingly complex holistic needs of local residents and business communities. Specifically: 

1.  Nottingham Community and Voluntary Service has used Tallant’s research to build trust internally and to make wise financial decisions that communicate trust to outsiders, at the same time freeing\-up funds to improve its community\-based services; 

1.  Nottingham’s Renewal Trust has enhanced its training for its staff by integrating Tallant’s philosophical approach to trust; 

1.  Nottingham and Nottinghamshire’s Integrated Care System has benefited from Tallant’s research on trust to inform its public consultation as it seeks to implement the NHS Long Term Plan at the local level. Its programme of public consultation has been held up as an exemplar around the country for other regions in their attempts to build public trust and engagement to successfully deliver personalised care; 

1.  Tallant’s research has improved understanding of the nature of trust among local businesses, the Confederation of British Industry \(CBI\), and the national and international business community fora.

###  **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2015 Tallant has been engaged in research on the philosophy of trust. This has led to the publication of four papers, each making a distinctive contribution to the philosophical literature. Each output focuses on improving our understanding of trust and/or exploring the ways in which the concept can and needs to be used outside of academia to drive an improvement in social, legal or commercial interactions. 

 Tallant \[ **1**\] argues that leading explanations of trust and distrust only account for trust that is directly acted upon. However, one person may trust another to complete a task even if the trustor does not actually rely on the trustee. Similarly, distrust can be present even if one person does not rely on another to complete a task because they distrust them. Existing models of trust fail to accommodate this important fact. Tallant argues that for one person to trust another to perform some task the trustor is required to believe that the trustee has a commitment to carrying it out, and either rely upon the trustee to carry it out or believe that they could be relied on to do so if called upon. Similarly, one person’s distrust of another would require that, if one withholds from asking another to complete a task, this withholding occurs because one does not believe the other is committed to carryout out the act. Thus, trust and distrust are a product, not just of our specific engagements with another party, but of our beliefs about what would happen were we to engage with them. In developing this argument, Tallant focuses on showing how the counterexamples that he develops pose a significant problem for the account developed and defended by Katherine Hawley, explaining how his own model can handle them very straightforwardly. 

 Tallant \[ **2**\] demonstrates that philosophical models of trust share a false presumption: that trust is an interpersonal relation \- a relation that links one person to another \(or to some others\). To develop this point, Tallant considers a range of philosophical accounts of trust, drawn from across the literature. He shows how each of them assumes trust is an interpersonal relation and that the accounts in question would not give us an adequate analysis of trust in inanimate objects. Tallant then proceeds to provide a range of cases to show that people do in fact put their trust in inanimate objects. This facet of trust is of obvious importance in any scenario where we trust a system \(for instance, a healthcare system\) or technology \(for instance, automated vehicles\). Based upon Tallant’s comprehensive survey of existing views and the novel examples discussed in his paper, he suggests that the leading accounts of trust are in need of revision and must be developed in such a way as to accommodate cases of trust in inanimate objects. 

 Tallant and Donati \[ **3**\] demonstrate that philosophical analyses of trust ought to be preferred to those provided in business and make the case for the adoption of philosophical methodologies and analyses of trust within the business sector and in management settings. They also argue that these philosophical analyses and methods ought to be adopted as a tool for guiding how we build and develop trust. To deliver this result, Donati and Tallant \[ **3**\] show there are cases of trust that business analyses misclassify as not being instances of trust, and cases that are not examples of trust that business analyses misclassify as instances of trust. They argue that this is striking and important given the ways in which the business literature supports empirical studies and management practice purporting to show how we can develop trust in companies, leadership, and a range of other business\-critical functions. 

 Work in the philosophy of education, and in educational theory, blurs the distinction between trust and its preconditions. Tallant’s work with Fisher \[ **4**\] offers a critique of pre\-existing work in the philosophy of education that has considered the role of trust. A primary focus of the paper is a careful discussion of the pre\-existing literature, showing that it does not give an analysis of trust that is sufficiently rigorous to classify correctly all and only cases of trust *as* cases of trust, in particular noting that the distinction between trust and the preconditions for trust are not clearly distinguished from one another. One key claim defended in the paper is that in looking to explore and realise the benefits of trust, it is crucial to both our planning and research within an educational context that we hold apart the pre\-conditions for trust and trust itself. In developing this line, Tallant and Fisher make the case for the importance of deploying philosophical analyses of trust when developing strategy and avenues for further research.

###  **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Trust is a prerequisite of all societal transactions, particularly those between institutions and individuals; the customers, clients, or community members these institutions serve. Starting in April 2016, as part of a University\-led *Enabling Innovation* programme funded by European Regional Development Funding \(2016\-19\), Tallant engaged with a network of around 80 small and medium enterprises \(SMEs\) during the early stages of his research. This engagement enabled him to develop key collaborations with the local voluntary sector, charitable bodies, the NHS and the business community, aligning his interactions to help deliver the NHS England Long Term Plan \(2019\). 

 The NHS England Long Term Plan is intended to make personalised care ‘business as usual’ across the healthcare system, benefiting up to 2.5 million people by 2023/24 \( [<ins>https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/upc/</ins>](https://www.england.nhs.uk/personalisedcare/upc/)\). Universal Personalised Care \(UPC\) is partly driven by a new practice called Social Prescribing, whereby Link Workers liaise with patients to develop a more holistic plan of care than can be offered by GPs alone at the clinical level. Mental health, employment, housing needs, and fulfilling leisure are now linked together, along with more traditional clinical needs that can be met by GPs. However, effective linking of these care avenues requires careful new approaches to joining up local services. Universal Personalised Care relies upon strong relationships and levels of trust at the local level, where care for people with complex needs is most effectively planned and delivered. In Nottingham and Nottinghamshire this is achieved by an innovative working partnership \(since 2019\) between the NHS’s Integrated Care System \(ICS\) working effectively with Clinical Commissioning Groups and the Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise \(VCSE\) sector.  Tallant’s research on trust has enabled two of these partnerships – Nottingham’s Community and Voluntary Service \(NCVS\) and its Integrated Care System – to make interventions in their plans to transform the delivery of personalised care, and has also helped improve business understanding of trust, in effort to drive up well\-being in the service of realising the aims of the NHS Plan. 

 <ins> **Enabling NCVS to deliver community\-based services**</ins> 

 After presenting on the nature of trust at the initial 2015 *Enabling Innovation* event for SMEs, Tallant was invited to join Nottingham Community and Voluntary Service \(NCVS\) in 2018 as a Trustee and became Chair in 2019 \[ **A**\]. Among other initiatives, NCVS supports the voluntary sector by improving the quality of volunteering opportunities across the city, strengthening the sector’s capacity to help its clients through promoting best practice, and speaking up for the voluntary sector on issues crucial to its future. As the Chief Executive remarks, ‘ *given his areas of research and the challenges we faced, the Board of Trustees took the decision to co\-opt Professor Tallant onto the Board of Trustees*’ **\[A**\] **.** Since then, Tallant has implemented changes to the strategy and vision of the organisation, putting trust at the centre of these transformations: *‘Drawing on his research on the nature of trust and distrust, as well as his work on the way that we treat trust in a management setting, we have been able to make significant progress’* \[ **A**\]. This has included overcoming challenges regarding lack of trust between different members of staff and the reputation of the organisation within the sector \[ **A**\]. According to the NCVS’s Consultant Chief Executive, Tallant’s understanding of effective trust in management settings has ‘ *significantly improve\[d\] staff relationships and communications between various groups,*’ and provided reputational benefits to the organisation through improving the ‘ *external perception of NCVS’* \[ **A**\], which was the first step towards increasing the effectiveness of NCVS as a crucial broker of community\-based services \[ **A**\]. 

 Subsequently, by advising NCVS on ‘ *judicious use of its finances’* in ways that communicate trust internally and externally, Tallant has enabled NCVS to generate £3m of funds by selling some of its assets \(in progress\). This was a critical achievement made possible through in\-depth changes in relationship networks and the culture of the organisation, with the funds enabling NCVS to ‘ *ensure the future of the organisation and its benefits to the voluntary organisations of the City of Nottingham’* in a way that *‘takes into account the needs of our various stakeholders’* \[ **A**\]. This sale means that NCVS can now be ‘ *increasingly community based \[…\] we shall be developing meaningful partnerships that will ensure communities thrive and prosper and where volunteers are valued and recognised*’ \[ **C**\]. Galvanising a strategy and a sense of trust among the NCVS members, which was needed to achieve the sale, has increased the organisation’s capacity and enabled it to be in the position to plan a more robust suite of community support programmes. 

 By January 2020, NCVS was working with the NHS and Nottingham’s Clinical Commissioning Groups to help roll out Social Prescribing in Nottingham’s eight local Primary Care Networks \[ **B**\]. This work puts trust at its core, in order to work co\-productively ‘ *across Nottingham’s \[…\] VCSE sector, building multi\-agency partnerships, raising awareness of Social Prescribing, sharing learning and good practice, mapping the gaps of VCSE provision and supporting and strengthening the development of VCSE provision*’ \[ **B**\]. In particular, NCVS has successfully aided the induction process of the eight Link Workers ‘ *who will enable patients to access appropriate support in the community, in order to improve their health and wellbeing*’ \[ **B**\]. 

 <ins> **Enhancing staff training at Renewal Trust charity, Nottingham**</ins> 

 The Renewal Trust is one such place of health and wellbeing support in Nottingham, a nationally recognised charity, which supports children, young adults and adults. The Trust is a community\-based regeneration organisation that Tallant has worked with to help its staff explore different kinds of trust and how they help develop the charity in sustainable ways \[ **1**\]. Following a day\-long workshop with Renewal, participants committed to a sustainable policy change, to *‘\[r\]ethink how we present our mission, ethics and culture strategy’*, with all members of the management team who attended noting that they had a better understanding of the kinds of trust and how they impact who trusts their charity \[ **D**\]. As attendees state, other areas of influence included ‘ *marketing and PR to communicate more the impact of our work to increase trust within the community’* \[ **D**\]. Subsequent feedback from the CEO reported that, ‘ *trust is particularly important in our sector as it underpins much of what we do, for this reason working on how to communicate it better with Jonathan was particularly welcome*’, also noting that the ‘ *workshop has helped us to understand better the significance of trust in the context of how we operate as a charity and its value in terms of pursuing our goal of providing better support for community care and regeneration*’.\[ **D**\] 

 <ins> **Supporting Nottingham and Nottinghamshire’s Integrated Care System \(ICS\) to implement the NHS Long Term Plan**</ins> 

 Following an introduction to the Director of Communications and Engagement at the ICS by the CEO of NCVS, Tallant undertook a range of activities to support the ICS in the delivery of the NHS Long Term Plan. To implement the Plan, which puts personalised care at its heart, local areas in England were tasked with engaging closely with local populations ‘ *to understand what matters to local people in their health services and to inform the development of a local system plan*’ \[ **F**\]. Working with Healthwatch Nottingham and Nottinghamshire, the ICS drew on Tallant’s research \(via two meetings\) to pay attention to how people can put their trust in systems such as the ICS \[ **1**, **2**\]. The Director of Communications and Engagement at the ICS has explained that Tallant \[ **1**\] ‘ *influenced the design of the survey questions that were used with local residents, including the choice of wording’* and \[ **2**\] helped make the case for, and articulated the content of, the materials used for communicating with these residents \[ **E**\]. This influence on survey design was particularly important as it enabled the ICS to ‘ *determine which areas within Nottingham to prioritise in the local strategy’* \[ **E**\], influencing the roll out plans for the programme. Crucially, Tallant advised the ICS to provide information materials ‘ *upfront to promote a sense of shared purpose and involvement*’, thereby strengthening levels of trust between stakeholders and the ICS \[ **E**\]. 

 As the Director of Communications and Engagement remarks: ‘ *Tallant’s input has led to a material improvement in our survey design and contributed to the significant level of success seen in the delivery of the engagement work*’ \[ **E**\]. During 2019, 1,000 local people took part in Integrated Care System’s survey. As ICS remarks, with a very high, 85% completion rate for the survey, this was ‘ *ahead of usual experiences, potentially as a result of the recommendation from Professor Tallant’* \[ **E**\]. This led to invaluable new insights into how the ICS can implement the NHS Long Term Plan around areas such as ‘ *mental health, urgent care, health prevention and more. These conversations with local people have given us a wealth of insight that will help us improve local services and deliver the NHS Long Term Plan in a way that reflects what matters to people’* \[ **F**\]. Nottingham and Nottinghamshire’s ICS has since been held up as an exemplar around the country for the way it has sought to implement the NHS Long Term Plan, influencing the guidance and practices in other regions \[ **E**\]. 

 As a result of this success, beyond Nottingham, Tallant was invited to address 300 NHS leaders, at an Integrated Care System Leadership conference in June 2019. This included leaders from hospitals, commissioning services, local authorities, community providers, and the voluntary sector \- all now key agents in implementing the NHS Long Term Plan via its emphasis on Social Prescribing. Focusing on the nature of trust and distrust, Tallant’s talk ‘An Issue of Trust: Building trust within systems’, enabled participants to understand the value of philosophical models of trust in addition to existing work in business systems, precisely because philosophical models such as Tallant’s highlight the potential gap between actual trust and the preconditions for trust \[ **1**, **3**, **4** \[ **G**\]\].Tallant has since taken up an invitation to join the Integrated Care Partnership Forum, providing governance for the future development of integrated health provision in Nottingham and thereby moving towards the successful implementation of the NHS Long Term Plan. 

 <ins> **Understanding trust for business in the context of the NHS Long Term Plan**</ins> 

 Alongside the NHS, care and voluntary sectors, the NHS Long Term Plan recognises the vital part that employers have to play in improving health and well\-being, asking ‘ *employers to commit to supporting their employees’ social wellbeing*’ \[ **H:**117\]. Trust is a key driver in work\-place well\-being.  Against that backdrop, Tallant improved private\-sector understanding of trust in order to help businesses deliver this plank of the NHS Long Term Plan. 

 As part of the *Enabling Innovation* programme, Tallant translated his research findings at two regional business fora in Derbyshire and in Nottingham, with 56 businesses present. These knowledge exchange events guided the business community on how trust is relevant to their business and management practices. The participating businesses commented that the research ‘\[ *m\]ade you think about concepts that previously you had taken for granted*.’ \[ **I**\] His later, 2018 version of the business engagement workshop led to 8 of 11 attending companies committing to a sustained impact through a change of approach in how the SMEs communicate and build trust with clients, with the participants commenting: ‘ *the workshop enables you to understand the different types of trust and how these might be gained and lost*’ \[ **I**\] Due to the success of these talks Tallant was commissioned to publish on trust in key publications within the sector, with the Federation of Small Businesses’ piece in the ‘ *First Voice’* on how Tallant’s philosophical analysis of trust can inform business owners’ approach to their own activities. This was later re\-printed in both *Finance Digest* and *Entrepreneur* *and Investor*, with a revised version published by *Management Today*. Collectively the print readership for these is at least 25,000, with online readerships topping 240,000 and international audiences consisting of Presidents, CEOs, CFOs and senior decision\-makers within Fortune 500 companies \[ **I**\]. 

 This appetite from the local business and community organisation sectors led to an invitation to     present to the **Confederation of Business and Industry** \(CBI\). The event, a CBI Future Leaders meeting in June 2019, attracted rising talent from businesses of all sizes and sectors. Tallant’s presentation was timed to coincide with the CBI’s publication of ‘Everyone’s business’, which tracks the perception of business. The event organiser reports that ‘ *it was clear from the response of the group \[at Tallant’s presentation\] that businesses do not always have a good insight into what Business Trust is*’ \[ **J**\] **.** As a result, Tallant was able to provide ‘ *clarity*’ to CBI members’ understanding of trust and his work was deemed as ‘ *extremely valuable*’ as ‘ *the group unanimously agreed that this insight helped them better understand the importance of trust in this context in protecting their reputation and furthering their business*’ \[ **J**\]. The knowledge filtered down into the practice of the CBI members, with the Midlands Associate Director noting that the ‘ *group members were able to share this with their executive teams*’ \[ **J**\]. She also states that her own approach and practice changed: ‘ *as associate director for the CBI in the Midlands, I have been able to speak more confidently on this matter in my member conversations*’ \[ **J**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Newcastle University conducted the first field experiments showing that eye imagery sub\-consciously affects behaviour, promoting pro\-social behaviour. Posters displaying “watching eyes” were used to reduce cycle thefts at 3 cycle racks on the university campus over a 12 month period by 63% compared to the same period the year before. Newcastle University academics worked with Police forces across the UK to implement “watching eyes” posters as cheap, simple and effective cycle theft interventions. A German police force has also tested “watching eyes” posters as a cycle theft deterrent in their region. Other impacts include other UK universities introducing “watching eyes” posters to combat cycle theft and personal protective equipment companies also independently introducing lines of eye imagery posters after learning of Newcastle research.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Unmet need for simple and effective crime interventions</ins> 

 Crime prevention requires cheap and simple interventions to support ongoing activities as well as quantitative evaluation to inform evidence\-based policy decisions. Bicycle theft in particular is a common problem with nearly 400,000 bikes stolen in the UK per year**Footnote:**

 [<ins>http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/412/bicycle\-crime\-statistics</ins>](http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/412/bicycle-crime-statistics) 
. Approaches to tackle these crimes have included CCTV and improved street lighting but these interventions are expensive and require additionally monitoring and upkeep. Therefore a cheap, simple method of deterring potential thieves is required. 

 <ins>Visual</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>ues to influence behaviour</ins> 

 Newcastle conducted simple experiments investigating the use of watching eye imagery to influence behaviour. First, images of a pair of eyes were displayed in a coffee room next to instructions for contributing to an honesty coffee fund, with contribution to fund used as a metric for honesty. The images of eyes alternated with images of flowers across 10 weeks of investigation. Results showed that in the weeks where “watching eyes” were displayed, contributions to the honesty box increased by three times \(R1\).This provided the first field evidence of watching being an important cue for influencing behaviour. Further investigation of this phenomena showed that the image of eyes displayed in a university cafeteria, halved the probability of littering and that this effect was strongest when fewer people were present in the cafeteria \(R2\). The presence of eye imagery on the litter itself was also shown to reduce littering \(R3\). This confirmed that the effects of subtle cues of observation on co\-operative behaviour can be significant in certain real\-world contexts. 

 <ins>“Watching eyes” as a deterrent for cycle theft</ins> 

 Newcastle recognised that images of “Watching eyes” could be a relatively cheap and effective method for deterring thieves. Therefore, in collaboration with Newcastle Security Services, a sign was designed displaying a pair of eyes and text saying “Cycle Thieves We Are Watching You” \(Figure 1\) and displayed alongside cycle racks for 6 months in 2011. The locations were monitored for 12 months before and after the implementation with other cycle racks on campus used as controls. Results showed a significant decrease in thefts of 63% where the signs were displayed \(R4\). 



 Figure 1 – the “Watching eyes” poster displayed around the Newcastle University Campus 

 Further research into the effects of “Watching eyes” posters suggests that the presence of the posters promotes a positive social change in behaviour, rather than enforcing local behavioural expectations. For example, experiments into charitable giving, showed that the probability of participants giving charitable donations significantly increased in the presence of “Watching eyes”, but had no effect on the mean amounts that people donated \(R5, R6\). 

 The presence of “Watching eyes” posters therefore encourages positive behavioural changes which can be implemented as a simple and cheap method of crime prevention.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>National Impacts on security</ins> 

 The “Watching eyes” signs have been used by several police forces in the UK to combat cycle theft, including North East London, the West Midlands and Leicestershire Police. In December 2013, as part of the OPERATION OWL neighbourhood watch scheme, the Waltham Forest Borough police force collaborated with Newcastle University to install posters at the top 6 cycle theft locations in the borough. In 2013 police in Waltham Forest Borough \(as of 2018, part of the North East Command Unit in London\), needed cheap and simple strategies for combating cycle crime which did not distract from their other duties, such as implementing traffic safety initiatives. As such the “Watching eyes” posters were recognised as offering “ *the perfect solution to both tackle cycle theft yet still allow police to commit their time to other life saving deployments*” \(EV1\). The posters were supplemented with home visits to known cycle thieves but the officer in charge of the project at the time commented that “ *the posters were able to police the problem, even when we were committed elsewhere*” \(EV1\). Between December 2013 and June 2014, there was a 25% decrease in cycle theft at the 6 cycle racks, compared to the same time frame the year before. Notably, one cycle rack saw a decrease of 75%. The drop in cycle theft extended to the rest of the borough which experienced a 14% drop in cycle theft incidents across the borough and an 81% drop around the area of Central Walthamstow between December 2013 and June 2014. 

 The success of the project led to the use of the posters in other London boroughs and for the posters to be adapted into small flyers to be displayed in front windows to tackle burglary \(EV1\). The officer in charge of the project noted that “ *The staring eyes posters did not do the investigative work for us, but they assisted in creating a brand, which was recognisable to members of the public and criminals alike. This no doubt increased the flow of intelligence we received and elevated the profile of cycle theft as a crime type*” \(EV1\). 

 Furthermore, 20 posters were put up at cycle theft hotspots at the University of East Anglia between 2013 and 2019 \(EV2\). The University reports that there were 40% fewer cycle thefts reported on campus than in 2013 and that there was “ *a rise in awareness from users of cycle racks. More sightings were reported of suspicious behaviour and a sense of ‘community spirit’ was felt in tackling cycle theft*” \(EV2\). 

 <ins>International impacts on security</ins> 

 In August 2014, the police force of Delmenhorst/Oldenburg\-Land/Wesermarsch in Germany became aware of the Newcastle research through press coverage and carried out their own investigation of the effectiveness of the “Watching eyes” posters. After consultation with Newcastle University the police force installed 10 “Watching eyes” posters in 3 cycle locations around the city on 1<sup>st</sup> August 2014. Signs adapted to include an equivalent “Cycle thieves. We are watching you” phrase in German and were placed in locations which were identified to be difficult or impossible to monitor. Reported cycle thefts were recorded both before \(2012\-2013, 2013\-2014\) and after installation \(2014\-2015\) and showed a 40\-65% drop in cycle theft numbers after the posters were introduced depending on the location \(Table 1, EV3\). 

 Table 1 – Cycle theft numbers from 3 locations in Delmenhorst.

 <ins>Impacts on public spaces</ins> 

 The ‘Keep Britain Tidy’ campaign used the “Watching eyes” posters in an anti\-dog\-fouling measure. The posters, based on Newcastle original design, were piloted in 2014 at 120 testing sites across 17 local authorities. The pilot recorded an average decrease in dog fouling of 46% which encouraged further implementation of the posters in 152 local authorities, parish councils and community groups across England. In some of these locations, dog\-fouling has been reduced by as much as 90% \(EV4\). Furthermore, the ‘Keep Britain Tidy’ campaign has won numerous awards including the 2015 Nudge Award, the Guardian Best Ads of 2015, the 2015 Local Government Chronicle Award – High Commendation and the 2016 Charity Award in the Environment and Conservation Category. These have helped to further increase the awareness of the work of the ‘Keep Britain Tidy’ campaign \(EV4\). 

 The “Watching eyes” posters have also been used by Boston Borough Council to directly combat fly\-tipping and littering. Boston Town Centre was recognised as a significant hotspot for fly\-tipping, and littering which negatively impacted local businesses and residents. The area was not protected by CCTV and regular patrols had been unsuccessful in deterring fly\-tipping. The incidence of fly\-tipping was reduced by 50% for the 3 months that posters were in place at the start of 2014, compared to the same time the year before \(EV5\). 

 <ins>Economic impacts</ins> 

 Following these implementations and success, the use of “Watching eyes” has become mainstream with the eyes seen extensively within stores and companies producing safety and security signage incorporating watching eyes imagery independent of involvement from Newcastle University. For example, the UK company \[Company X\] developed a range of signage after seeing reports of the Newcastle University research. They provide this signage through their distributors to construction, safety and security, fire and PPE supplies sectors across the UK \[redacted for publication\] \(EV6\). 

 <ins>In summary</ins> 

 Newcastle research found that the presence of Watching eye imagery prompts positive behavioural changes. This simple and effective intervention has been used in the UK to tackle littering and fly tipping and in the UK and Germany to reduce bicycle thefts. The concept of “Watching eye” imagery has now extended into the public space, most obviously by companies developing effective safety and security signage with these designs.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 The airborne fungus *Aspergillus* causes life\-threatening invasive aspergillosis and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis \(\(CPA\), five\-year mortality >50%\) and exacerbates asthma. The University of Manchester \(UoM\)’s world\-leading aspergillosis research has: 1\) improved diagnostics, aiding earlier effective treatment; 2\) led to new treatments through multiple drug studies; 3\) improved patient survival and quality of life. Notably, Voriconazole results in 13% improved survival in invasive aspergillosis and has been used to treat millions of patients \(peak annual sales over USD750,000,000\). Since August 2013, the National Aspergillosis Centre \(NAC\), led by Denning, has treated >800 new patients, with >9,900 outpatient follow\-up attendees. Manchester publications are embodied in European and US treatment guidelines for invasive aspergillosis and CPA. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Denning was the primary academic in the clinical evaluation of Pfizer’s antifungal azole Voriconazole. He wrote the protocol and led the case evaluation process for the landmark study, which demonstrated that Voriconazole was superior to amphotericin B, the only intravenous drug available \(and never prospectively studied\) \[1\]. This was the first study to demonstrate an improvement in survival in any invasive fungal disease \(13% absolute survival benefit compared to amphotericin\). It led to global approval of Voriconazole. 

 In 2003, Denning published a landmark paper on CPA, integrating complex radiological findings with mycological data and patients’ clinical courses to provide a new understanding \(and nomenclature\) for a disease entity first described in 1848 \[2\]. This definition of disease has been used across the world for epidemiology and prospective studies, and to evaluate diagnostics. This and a subsequent body of 96 publications from Manchester \(2002–2020\), described the epidemiology and clinical course of disease and closely related entities \(notably *Aspergillus nodule*\). These publications also evaluated the performance of several different commercially available serological assays and demonstrated the value of antifungal therapy \(previously only surgery was offered\), notably the safe and effective azole antifungal Posaconazole \[3\]. The high frequency of azole resistance on therapy \(15–20%\), and several genetic and pathophysiological features of the disease, have also been described. Numerous retrospective analyses documented the impact of antifungal therapy on arresting progression and improved quality of life \(the first such descriptions for any fungal disease\) using standardised tools. 

 Fungal asthma, which affects 10–15,000,000 people globally, is a subset of severe asthma that accounts for a significant proportion of treatment costs. In 2009, Denning and colleagues described the link between severe asthma and fungal sensitisation \(SAFS\) and defined SAFS as a disease entity. They undertook a double\-blind randomised controlled trial \(RCT\) of the oral antifungal Itraconazole for the treatment of SAFS \[4\] which demonstrated a quality of life benefit, based on the validated Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score, and a markedly reduced total blood IgE \(allergy marker\) with treatment. This was the first blinded RCT evaluating antifungal therapy for a subset of severe adult asthmatics, showing benefits in improved quality of life and allergy markers, rather than lung function which has been historically the key endpoint of most severe asthma prospective studies. 

 Case observations at UoM led to the clinical description of *Aspergillus* bronchitis, the first series of patients \(n=17\), and provided criteria for diagnosis \[5\]. This represents an important new clinical entity in respiratory medicine, particularly affecting those with bronchiectasis. 

 Denning also published an estimate of the global burden of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis \(ABPA\) using deterministic modelling \[6\], a seminal step in the development of epidemiological data to highlight the unmet medical need for ABPA patients worldwide.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 *Aspergillus fumigatus* is the most common species to cause human aspergillosis infections. It causes multiple disease entities, which are diagnosed and managed differently. UoM researchers have transformed disease concepts and management of pulmonary aspergillosis. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

###  Global health impact of Voriconazole 

 Denning’s seminal research with Voriconazole \[1\] led to licensure in 2002 and continued worldwide use as first\-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Voriconazole remains the globally recommended treatment for invasive aspergillosis \[A\] and its extensive use in other forms of aspergillosis evidences its effectiveness in ABPA, ‘fungal asthma’ CPA and *Aspergillus* bronchitis \[3\]. 

 Pfizer’s annual reports show total Voriconazole sales between 2013–2017 of over USD3,000,000,000 \[B\]. In 2014/15, prior to introduction of generic products, UK National Aspergillosis Centre \(NAC\) expenditure on Voriconazole was GBP2,800,000, 67% of its total antifungal spend, demonstrating the importance of the drug in treatment \[C\]. 

 Following a 2017 application citing several UoM papers and supported by Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections \(GAFFI\), UoM and others, Voriconazole was granted World Health Organization \(WHO\) ‘Essential Medicine’ status \[D\]. This status is given only to the most effective and safe medicines needed in healthcare systems and is used by countries as a basis for their essential medicine lists. 

 [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voriconazole)Voriconazole is now available in >115 countries globally and generic versions registered in >35 countries \[E\]. 

###  Clinical guidelines for CPA 

 Denning, working with the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and European Respiratory Society, published the first clinical guidelines specifically for CPA \(2016\). These recommended treatment with Voriconazole \[1\]; Posaconazole \[3\] was recommended as a potential alternative \[F\]. Denning co\-authored Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance recommending Itraconazole and Voriconazole as preferred oral antifungals with Posaconazole a “ *useful third\-line agent for those with adverse events or clinical failure*” \[Ai\]. 

###  Enabling effective treatment via accurate diagnosis 

 UoM researchers have described new clinical entities caused by *Aspergillus* in addition to SAFS, namely cancer\-mimicking *Aspergillus* lung nodules, and renamed/defined diagnostic criteria for *Aspergillus* bronchitis in non\-immunocompromised patients and cystic fibrosis. The June 2018 revision of WHO’s International Classification of Diseases \(ICD11\) includes CPA \(and sub\-types\) and *Aspergillus* bronchitis for the first time \[G\]. This code is used in health systems worldwide for documenting disease. As a cornerstone of good medicine, accurate diagnostic labelling means these diseases can be treated appropriately. 

###  Guidelines for diagnosing ABPA 

 Guidelines for diagnosing ABPA resulted from Denning’s collaboration with the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology \[H\]. They are routinely used by clinicians and in prospective clinical studies. The Chief Executive Officer of Pulmatrix, a US company developing an inhaled antifungal medicine, stated: “ *Dr Denning’s collaboration with a global group of experts was central to the development of clear guidelines for the diagnosis of ABPA*… *clear and consistent diagnostic criteria are fundamental for the development of a clinical program of treatment and form the foundation of our ongoing clinical program to develop such a treatment*’ \[Iii\]. 

###  Increased serological testing 

 Increased recognition of CPA as a clinical entity led to a resurgence of interest in *Aspergillus* serological testing and radiological interpretation. For example, in 2018, the first point\-of\-care assay for *Aspergillus* IgG antibody was launched by LDBio, a French diagnostic company. LDBio’s Research and Development Director stated, “ *the important work done by Manchester on aspergillosis, with its global perspective, was one of the key factors that led us into attempting to produce our LDBio Aspergillus assay*” \[Ii\]. LDBio have product distributors in 17 countries and their assay is shipped worldwide \[Ii\]. 

###  Pulling antifungal drug development into new areas of need 

 UoM’s SAFS research \[4\] opened new fields of clinical study and drug development. Amongst four companies developing the first inhaled antifungal therapies are Pulmatrix and Pulmocide, both attracting significant financing for their work. 

 Pulmatrix’s inhaled antifungal is in phase II study in asthmatic patients, initiated in 2019. Their CEO stated, “ *Pulmatrix has raised over $60 million* \[USD60,000,000\] *through partnership and financing efforts to support all R & D efforts. These efforts have been heavily influenced by the work of Dr Denning and his colleagues at the University of Manchester*” \[Iii\]. 

 UK company, Pulmocide, are developing PC945, a novel triazole inhaled antifungal. Their Chief Scientific Officer \(CSO\) stated Denning’s research “ *has enabled Pulmocide to focus on indications of highest unmet clinical need…Publications from the Manchester group have clarified the diagnostic criteria for infections caused by Aspergillus*” \[Iiii\]. 

 PC945 is currently in phase II trials, including patient recruitment at NAC. It has been used on a “special needs” basis in nine patients, unresponsive to multiple antifungal therapies. Pulmocide reported in July 2020, of nine patients treated, eight showed positive clinical results \[J\]. 

 On commercial impact, Pulmocide’s CSO stated, “ *Manchester publications on disease prevalence have clarified indications of maximal future commercial potential. This has been supportive of the Pulmocide ability to attract venture capital investment for the company*” \[Iiii\]. Pulmocide are supported by top\-tier investors including SV Health Investors, Johnson & Johnson Innovation and SR One, GlaxoSmithKline’s corporate venture capital arm \[Iiii\]. 

###  Nationally commissioned infectious disease service 

 Founded and directed by UoM’s Denning \(2009\-2020\), Manchester’s NAC was the UK’s first nationally commissioned infectious disease service, and the world’s first national clinical centre for a fungal disease. National commissioning was based on Denning’s clinical research expertise \[2, 3\], clinical care complexity, need for specialised investigations, and antifungal drug cost. NAC and Mycology Reference Centre were awarded European Confederation of Medical Mycology’s Diamond Centre of Excellence status in January 2017, the only such UK centre. From August 2013 to March 2020, >2,500 patients were referred to NAC, >800 were diagnosed with CPA and >9,900 outpatient follow up appointments were attended \[C\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Helge Hoel has developed a methodology known as ‘Faktaundersøkelse’ \(‘investigation of facts’\) to resolve workplace bullying allegations fairly and rigorously. Within the Norwegian Armed Forces, large European construction firms, and Scandinavian local and regional authorities, more than 1,000 managers have implemented the procedures in their workplaces, such that 200,000 employees are now protected. Impacts as a result of the implementation include: a radically *enhanced competency* within workplaces to deal with bullying and harassment allegations; an improvement in the stringency and formality of anti\-bullying investigations resulting in *more equitable outcomes*; an improvement in *employee and workplace wellbeing*; and the development of workplace anti\-bullying policies leading to *cultural change*. Norwegian magistrate and county courts now recognise the Faktaundersøkelse approach as a vital procedural tool for resolving disputes. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2001, Professor Hoel reported findings from the first nationwide survey of workplace bullying in Great Britain \[1\], which was sponsored by the British Occupational Health Research Foundation. This large sample study identified that one in ten respondents \(10.6%\) reported having been bullied within the previous six months and more than one in four \(24.7%\) had been bullied in the past five years. Additionally, almost half of respondents \(46.5%\) had witnessed bullying in the previous five years. In 2009, Hoel and his colleagues used these findings to inform the development and validation of the Negative Acts Questionnaire Revised \(NAQ\-R\) \[2\]. This questionnaire is the most widely used instrument for measuring exposure to bullying and harassment at work, and has been applied in several hundred studies worldwide. 

 Having documented the prevalence of bullying at work, Hoel then began to examine the contextual factors associated with bullying and different approaches to addressing the problem, including the role of industrial relations, the role of leadership and the role of policies and regulations. Hoel took an interventionist perspective to examine the investigation processes surrounding bullying complaints, with a view to improving this process \[3\], \[4\]. Hoel and colleagues examined how complaint processes are administered, how evidence is gathered and its probability of being considered, and how decisions are reached given the legal/regulatory framework and applicable standards. This research also identified the barriers to and enablers of effective complaints processes, including the need to ensure objectivity and fairness of the complaints process and the need for specialist support for the individuals who may be carrying out the investigation. Whereas previous research predominantly examined the experience of the complainant or the organisational context for bullying, Hoel’s research was the first to systematically examine how serious cases of bullying could be better managed through more effective investigation and complaints procedures. 

 Professor Hoel also undertook international comparisons of differing national approaches to the management of bullying at work. Through detailed case analyses of Scandinavian practices, Hoel identified shortcomings in the approaches prevailing in this region \[4\], \[5\]. He documented how the Swedish approach had few formal methods to respond to complaints, including a lack of an investigatory system and a strong reluctance to assigning blame, guilt and responsibility \[5\]. Similarly, the Norwegian approach to addressing workplace bullying was found to be very informal with management processes rarely guided by formal policies or written guidelines, resulting in particularly negative consequences for targets of bullying and harassment \[6\]. 

 Hoel’s research pointed to significant differences between the Scandinavian approach and the investigation practices and training approaches offered by British employers, particularly those in the North West of England. Accordingly, Professor Hoel \(along with his collaborators Einarsen and Pedersen\) worked with the Norwegian Labour Inspectorate \(Arbeidstilsynet\) to develop a methodology, Faktaundersøkelse \(‘investigation of facts’\), for use in difficult bullying cases in the workplace \[5\]. This new methodology located bullying complaints within the framework of the employer’s duty of care and the managerial prerogative, offering a structured and fair response to complaints where no formal tradition existed. The results of this research were reported in a book, ‘Faktaundersøkelse’ \[6\], which provides the case for and gives advice on how to deal with inter\-personal problems and complaints of bullying and harassment in the workplace. Whilst various similar approaches are used in Anglo\-Saxon countries, this is the first attempt to address the issue holistically in the specific Scandinavian socio\-political and regulatory context. This formal methodology constitutes a fundamental departure from the informal way of addressing conflicts of this nature in this context.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Pathway to Impact** 

 In 2005 Hoel was engaged as an expert international adviser for a three year Norwegian national initiative *Jobbing uten Mobbing* \(Working without Bullying\) initiated by the Ministry of Labour under the supervision of the Norwegian Labour Inspectorate. Acting as international advisor to the Steering Committee for the duration of the project, Hoel was tasked with examining British experiences on formal responses to bullying/harassment in the workplace with high\-level, tripartite participation from trade union confederations, employer organisations and the Labour Inspectorate. Due to the uniformly positive response from the participants, a committee with tripartite membership was established with Hoel as advisor. The committee subsequently endorsed the Faktaundersøkelse investigation method, based on Hoel’s cross\-national research and applied to the Norwegian socio\-political context. The committee also recommended anti\-bullying policy development at the organisational level to assist the Faktaundersøkelse approach. Hoel was then contracted by the Labour Inspectorate to develop a three\-day pilot training programme outlining the Faktaundersøkelse methodology which he delivered to an invited audience, primarily senior HR managers invited by the Labour Inspectorate. Given the success of this pilot work, Hoel then devised a revised three\-day course drawing on subsequent research into bullying in the workplace \[4\], \[5\], \[6\], aimed at competence and capacity building within organisations for addressing workplace bullying allegations. 

 **4.2. Impact in Scandinavian Workplaces** 

 Since 2014, Hoel has trained over 1,000 high\-level employees from many Scandinavian organisations in his ‘investigation of facts’ \(faktaundersøkelse\) method. These organisations include the Norwegian Armed Forces \(16,000 employees\), Kvaerner \(2,700 employees\), Statoil Equinor \(21,000 employees\), Veidekke \(7,000 employees\) and 54 local and regional authorities in Norway and Sweden including Gothenburg \(55,000 employees\), Stavanger \(9,000 employees\) Sandnes and Fredrikstad \(6,000 employees each\). This has resulted in a network of highly competent local case investigators across Scandinavia. Course attendees are mostly managers and advisors from an organisation’s HR function or management consultants and independent occupational health services. Attendees take insights into practical approaches and improved personal competences back to their own organisations to shape new practices and incorporate them within their own organisation’s policy frameworks \[A\], \[B\], \[C\], \[D\], \[E\]. 

 Feedback on and evaluations of Hoel’s training programme have shown significant organisational impacts in four areas: \(1\) *enhanced competency* within workplaces to deal with bullying and harassment allegations, \(2\) improvement in the rigour of anti\-bullying investigations, resulting in *more equitable outcomes*, \(3\) improvement in *employee and* *workplace wellbeing*, and \(4\) the development of workplace anti\-bullying policies leading to *cultural change*. 

 **4.2.1 Enhanced Competency** 

 Professionals who have been trained in Hoel and colleagues’ method have been able to embed what they have learned into their own organizations, increasing competence for investigating claims of bullying.  In Norway, a training organization focused on conflict resolution in the workplace, Arbeidsmiljøspesialistene, has developed training courses based on Hoel’s method \[A\]. Since 2014, more than 500 people have taken part in Arbeidsmiljøspesialistene’s three\-day residential course aimed at building in\-house competence in investigation of facts \[A\].  Professionals from both the public and private sectors have attended these courses, including HR/occupational health professionals from 24 local authorities \[A\].  More than 200 professionals have undertaken further training to receive a certification of competence in anti\-bullying policy development.  In Sweden, the training organization Metodicum has collaborated with Hoel to design and deliver a training course that develops competence in the investigation of facts method \[B\].  Since 2017, approximately 400 people have taken part in a three\-day residential course that enables them to implement the method in their organizations \[B\].  Metodicum has trained investigators in 30 local or regional authorities in the Swedish public sector, in most cases with a minimum of two persons per authority. 

 Evidence from mutiple organizations shows that HR departments are better equipped to deal with bullying allegations after adopting Hoel’s investigation method. For example, the Commander of the Norwegian Armed Forces Human Resources Management Services who chaired a working group using Hoel’s method said that \[C\]: “ *the faktaundersøkelse method has had a significant impact on the HR capabilities of the Norwegian Armed Forces. Following the \#metoo campaign and associated whistle\-blowing cases, there has been an explosion of work for our organization in handling cases of bullying and harassment. Without Hoel and colleagues’ methods and training, we would not have developed such clear procedures for dealing with these complaints. Adopting these highly trusted and effective procedures has significantly increased our capacity and competence to undertake this increasingly important work*”. 

 At Kvaerner, Hoel trained 40 employees in his method, which has resulted in a network of local, competent investigators. The company highlights that \[D\]: “ *the training and development of the network has significantly improved our internal competencies for dealing with complaints of bullying*”. 

 **4.2.2. Equitable outcomes** 

 Participants in the faktaundersokelse courses have confirmed that one of the most significant outcomes of their training has been an improvement in the rigour and stringency of internal anti\-bullying investigations. Many participants reported that prior to Hoel’s training course, there was an uneven application of process as anti\-bullying investigations were mostly carried out at local levels and with varying levels of formality by different managers. This led to arbitrary and often unsatisfactory outcomes for both complainants and defendants. The faktaundersokelse procedure has therefore \[C\]: “ *enshrined fair treatment in cases of bullying and whistleblowing \[in the Norwegian Armed Forces\], as the cases are now carried out according to a standardised policy and investigatory methodology that is based on firm legal foundations*”. 

 At Kvaerner, the procedure has been praised as \[D\]:“ *a very orderly tool to investigate complaints*”. An internal workforce survey confirmed that in more than 80% of anti\-bullying cases carried out since the faktaundersokelse procedure was implemented at the company, a satisfactory resolution to the dispute was reached without further complaint or need for additional investigation. 

 **4.2.3. Workplace Wellbeing** 

 At the Norwegian Armed Forces, Hoel’s procedure \[C\]: “ *has engendered an improvement in the emotional wellbeing of both complainants and defendants, as they feel reassured by the stringency and formality of the process and have a high degree of confidence in the fairness of the procedure. This is evidenced by the fact that there have been no complaints about the application of the process, either by complainants or defendants, once a resolution has been reached*”. 

 **4.3. Development of Policies and Cultural Change** 

 Hoel has devised a further two\-day course on anti\-bullying policy development and implementation. A number of large companies in Scandinavia, that were previously lacking official anti\-bullying policies, have attested to organisation\-wide cultural changes that have occurred since the development of new anti\-bullying policies stemming from this course. For example Holger Iversen, Vice\-President of HR at Kvaerner, has stated that Hoel’s methodology and training course directly fed into the development of a new anti\-bullying policy which has \[D\]: “ *created a cultural change in the organisation by underscoring a ‘duty to act’ where harassment is seen or reported. Managers within the organisation are now compelled to take action as soon as they have been made aware of unacceptable behaviour*”. Kvaerner subsequently ran training courses for its employees to educate them on the new policy; a workforce survey in 2020 with 872 responses found that the policy is ‘extremely well known’ and respondents reported that now the policy is in place, there has been increased trust among employees that managers and the HR department would handle complaints in a satisfactory manner \[D\].  Veidekke’s occupational safety officer stated that “ *Veidekke have developed procedures for handling employee grievances, including complaints of bullying and harassment, based on Professor Hoel and Professor Einarsen’s “Faktaundersøkelse” \(FU/Investigation of Facts\) principle*”\[E\].  She stated that “ *One of the main outcomes of adopting the FU/Investigation of Facts methodology has been the formalisation of the investigation process to be fair and transparent for all parties*” \[E\]. 

 Evidencing the effects of policy and culture changes triggered by Hoel’s method, the Norwegian Armed Forces conducted an internal survey \(MOST survey, 8,900 respondents\) which illustrated that \[C\]: “ *the number of bullying and harassment allegations within the organisation \[had\] risen dramatically*”, especially since the prevalence of the \#metoo social media campaign. For the organisation, these results show that Hoel’s faktaundersøkelse method \[C\]: “ *has entered the language of the Norwegian Armed Forces and has become a firmly rooted and well\-respected concept amongst employees. As such, it has led to a cultural change within the Armed Forces in which employees feel able to bring complaints without the fear that they will be treated unfairly*.” Moreover, the Armed Forces has catalysed the use of faktaundersokelse procedures on a national level by creating a new working group with the Department for Defence on whistleblowing procedures and reporting channels which \[C\] “ *uses Hoel and colleagues’ method as a common language to create an understanding of how to fairly process such complaints*”. Such central coordination groups are also evident in the Gothenburg local authority, where local trade unions have participated in the training programs and have fully endorsed the implementation of the methodology \[B\]. 

 **4.4. Impact on Court Cases and Legal Debate** 

 Although most faktaundersøkelse investigations are resolved within workplaces, within the last few years an increasing number of court decisions in employment\-related cases by Norwegian magistrates courts \( *tingrett*\) and appeals courts at county level \( *lagmannsrett*\) have referenced the methodology \[F\]. Such acknowledgement of the process in court documents \[G\] confirms that faktaundersøkelse has not only become a common pathway to conflict resolution within Norwegian workplaces, but also a recognised process within the Norwegian legal system in cases where the conflict is escalated to courts. The faktaundersokelse procedure has had a significant impact on legal debate as it is now recognised as playing an important role in resolving conflict within Norwegian workplaces.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Bryony Hoskins’ research focuses on the low level of political engagement amongst young people and the dynamics that underpin it. In collaboration with UNICEF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe and UNESCO, Hoskins' research has, since 2014, been adopted in the development of measurement instruments to assess the effectiveness of education interventions designed to increase active citizenship. These instruments and the accompanying analysis have supported the monitoring of active citizenship and political engagement and identified effective teaching and learning practices for different social groups on a global level. This work has subsequently shaped international policy as well as educational practice across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hoskins’ research \( **R1**\- **R5**\) directly addresses the role of schools in teaching political engagement, how they enhance socioeconomic inequalities in political engagement, and what methods work to reduce these inequalities. Her research tests and proposes solutions to mitigate inequalities and promote greater political engagement amongst young people regardless of their socioeconomic background. 

 Hoskins analysed various European education systems and their effect on education in active citizenship \( **R1\-R3**; **G1**\) and political engagement, identifying, measuring and comparing the citizenship values and political participatory attitudes of young people and the consequences of social inequalities in the learning of citizenship. Through this process, Hoskins has been able to demonstrate the different results produced by education systems that prioritise different teaching methodologies and have contrasting conceptions of active citizenship. Social justice values, citizenship knowledge and skills are particularly facilitated in the Nordic education system due to the prioritisation of the promotion of autonomous critical thinking in citizenship education in school from an early age. However, this prioritisation may not be the most effective approach to enhance participatory attitudes or concepts of a good citizen, as noted in a comparison to educational approaches developed in medium\-term democracies with civic republican traditions, such as Italy and Greece. In these countries, teachers prioritise civic responsibility, which consequently achieves the most positive results for young people’s citizenship values and participatory attitudes \( **R1**\). 

 In addition to the differences in learning outcomes between educational systems that function under different priorities, Hoskins' research \( **R2, R3, R5**; **G1**\) demonstrates that socioeconomic inequalities tend to negatively influence the political engagement of young people through the type of education that they are offered. In Germany and England, the lowest levels of political engagement \(voting or protesting\) were seen amongst those who had undertaken low level vocational qualifications, which appear to be reducing their levels of political engagement. As most young people in England who undertake vocational and low\-level qualifications are from disadvantaged backgrounds, the education system is thus exacerbating the social reproduction of inequalities in political engagement. Furthermore, young people from disadvantaged backgrounds already have reduced access to participatory forms of learning in two ways. First, within a school, where more advantaged children are involved in student councils and activities such as school debates; and second, between schools, where the schools with a higher proportion of advantaged children are involved in more participatory activities and have more open classroom discussions. 

 Having identified the key factors that result in lack of political engagement and low levels of active citizenship amongst young people, Hoskins elaborated and tested potential solutions in her 2019 monograph \( **R5**\). Based on a large scale representative longitudinal dataset that followed young people every two years from the ages of 11 to 23, Education, Democracy and Inequality: Political Engagement and Citizenship Education in Europe \( **R5**\) proposes two paths for developing political engagement: 1\) participatory learning processes \(i.e. civic participation and student voice opportunities in school\) and 2\) knowledge transmission on political topics \(i.e. citizenship education\). The research finds that access to these learning opportunities for young people from all social backgrounds is key in the reduction of inequalities in political engagement. This research has subsequently been central to the development of citizenship education and political engagement assessment instruments created by Hoskins that have been used across the world.

 Hoskins’ research \( **R1**\- **R5**\) has been applied to the development of assessment instruments that have been used – in collaboration with UNICEF, the World Bank, the Council of Europe \(CoE\) and UNESCO – to analyse the quality of education for active citizenship across Europe and countries in the Middle East and North Africa region \(MENA\). The findings of these assessment exercises have consequently informed the development of education policy across the CoE’s forty\-seven member states and the MENA region, which greatly benefited young people internationally. In particular, the changes in education policy contributed to the increase of young peoples’ levels of self\-confidence, empowering them to express their opinions, to take initiative and participate as more active citizens in their communities. 

 Since 2015, UNICEF and the World Bank have been working on the development and integration of the Life Skills and Citizenship Education programme \(LSCE\) in the MENA region. This initiative promotes the integration of life skills in national education systems across the area, aiming to equip all children and young people with skills for lifelong learning, employability, personal empowerment and active citizenship. From the outset, Hoskins’ research \( **R1**\) has been essential for the successful development and implementation of LSCE. She was first approached in 2015, due to her reputation ‘as one of the world\-leading experts on measuring Active Citizenship’ \( **IMP1**\). Subsequently, Hoskins was awarded two grants, both resulting in follow\-up funding \(totalling $236,606.29\) from UNICEF to support the development of instruments to measure life skills and citizenship education \( **G2**, **G5**\). Alongside regional partners and national Ministries of Education \(MoEs\) of the MENA region, Hoskins’ research on civic competence was used in in the development of a conceptual and programmatic framework for key life skills in active citizenship \( **R1**\), which was published in 2017 \( **IMP2**\). Her knowledge of effective citizenship education and measurement instruments \( **R2**, **R4, R5**\) was used in her evidence\-based report published in 2019 \( **IMP3**\) which covers the available instruments for measuring life skills and how these can be taught effectively \( **R5**\). 

 Hoskins’ extensive knowledge of the measuring of non\-cognitive skills \( **R1, R5**\) supported the development of a life skills assessment instrument for school that now enables countries to assess the quality and distribution of life skills curricula across the school\-aged population. During April 2019, the instrument was tested in Egypt, Palestine, and Tunisia, and was applied in 20 classrooms in each country, reaching 4,568 students \( **IMP4**\). The Egyptian Ministry of Education recognised the relevance of this tool, stating that it ‘is very essential and it will help us monitor the impact of the curricula that are dependent on life skills and citizenship education and how they enhance our students’ skills’ \( **IMP4**\). This led the Egyptian Ministry of Education to start the integration at the system\-level of standardised life skill assessment. The now finalised measurement instrument, informed by Hoskins’ research \( **R2**, **R3**\), provides a standardised approach for assessing life skills proficiency targeting the lower\-secondary education age group which has informed the approach of UNICEF and the World Bank. According to the UNICEF regional advisor from the MENA regional office, ‘UNICEF and The World Bank are currently discussing the application of the measurement instrument as a largescale national assessment in a few countries in the region, and further redeveloping it as a standardized pre\-post\- intervention instrument to evaluate the effectiveness of specific interventions. \[Hoskins’\] expertise has enabled significant advancement in measuring life skills in the MENA region and has supported ministries and partners to improve their education systems and interventions and thereby increase the chances that children and young people from the region will get structured teaching of life skills and achieve better life outcomes’ \( **IMP1**\). 

 The implementation of LSCE across the MENA region has resulted in significant benefits for the young people involved, leading to an increase in self\-confidence, empowering them to find their voice and providing them with the capacity to express their own opinion while also enabling greater cooperation between students, including moving beyond ethnic and national biases. In Jordan, the students noted that the programme led to an increase in their own self\-confidence, empowering and encouraging them to participate in more activities, to express themselves both at home and in school, to better recognise their own skills and talents and helping them to make their own decisions, particularly about what they want to do in the future. In Palestine, the programme has been adopted by 220 grade 1\-4 schools. In schools in Nablus and Ramallah, the implementation of LSCE led children to learn and apply life skills that are essential for daily life such as how to manage a budget, work with banks, and how to choose the most nutritious fruits and vegetables as well as to cooperate and think critically, to consider their dreams and aspirations for the future and even wonder about the political future of Palestine. The programme was recognised by the Principal of a school for girls in Nablus as one of the best they ever implemented \( **IMP5**\). 

 Young people who benefited from the introduction of the LSCE programme in Lebanon also reported an increase in self\-confidence and trust in their colleagues and a greater aptitude for expressing their own ideas and collaborating with other students. The programme for older students had a greater focus on leadership, transforming the students’ behaviour and opinion concerning key social issues, improving their capacity to communicate and become more active in their community. One Syrian student explained how her own attitude was transformed, from being prejudiced against her Lebanese colleagues to now having developed bonds of friendship with them. Another noted that ‘Conflict resolution is the most important thing to me. Now I think differently. To solve a conflict between two people we must establish dialogue between them, to express their opinions, to determine who’s right and who’s wrong. We are active youth serving our community. We have our role and we have a voice’. These students have since started working on opening a clinic to address the lack of a hospital in their village and have been cooperating with the municipality to raise awareness of sanitation issues such as the lack of refuse bins in the area or the need to place water filters in schools to address water contamination \( **IMP5**\). 

 In 2016, and simultaneously with the work developed with UNICEF and The World Bank, Hoskins collaborated with the Council of Europe \(CoE\) to ensure the rigorous evaluation and quality implementation of the Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship \(EDC\). The EDC, developed by the CoE and adopted by the CoE’s forty\-seven member states \(CM/Rec \(2010\)7\), officially recognises the essential role of education in the promotion of the core values of the CoE. EDC is a crucial reference point for all those dealing with citizenship and human rights education, providing and disseminating good practice guidelines throughout Europe and beyond. In order to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the EDC, the CoE asks the member states to respond to a questionnaire regarding the countries’ levels of implementation of the EDC. The result of this assessment is crucial to supporting the development of policy in this field by the member states and CoE. In this context, the CoE have sought out Hoskins’ collaboration due to her expertise and ‘specialist knowledge in the field of Education for Democratic Citizenship’ \( **IMP6**\). According to the CoE’s Head of Education Policy Division,  Professor Hoskins’ research has been invaluable in ‘1\) Improving the quality and rigour of the analysis of the questionnaires from the member states in particular drawing on her expertise in how to assess progress over time \[ **R2**, **R4**, **R5**\] 2\) Helping to draw findings and policy implications from the analysis and results based on her research in the field in particular on the effect of inequalities in access to learning democratic citizenship \[ **R2**, **R4**, **R5**\]; and 3\) Quality assuring the reporting by the Council of Europe to the Member States and civil society organisations \[ **R1**, **R5**\]’ \( **IMP6**\). 

 This assessment exercise shows that there has been significant progress since 2012. Education for democratic citizenship and human rights has gained more importance throughout Europe, and is increasingly recognised as an essential response to the challenges that face modern societies. Nevertheless, it was recognised that work was needed to increase equality of access to citizenship and human rights learning opportunities. Hoskins’ analysis and these findings were included in the 2017 CoE report \( **IMP7**\), which was presented at the CoE conference in June 2017 to over 400 persons from MoEs, NGOs, educational institutions and practitioners from across Europe. These findings have been used by the CoE to inform and support the member states to fully implement the EDC. The main political outcome from the conference, the CoE Declaration DGII/EDU/CIT \(2017\)7, adopted Hoskins’ research findings \( **R2, R4**\) in the development of key actions strategy for national governments, specifically under point 2, which aims to ‘Ensure quality, balanced provision of EDC/HRE in all areas and types of education, with specific attention paid to areas where EDC/HRE is less present such as pre\-school education, vocational education and training, and higher education’; and point 5 which looks to ‘Ensure access to EDC/HRE, paying particular attention to vulnerable and marginalised groups, including young people who are not in education or training’ \( **IMP8**\). The outcomes from these recommendations will be assessed in 2021. 

 In partnership with the CoE, UNESCO approached Hoskins in 2020 to develop research into the impact of the COVID\-19 pandemic on student voice in secondary schools across Europe and MENA countries. Informed by her research \( **R2**, **R3**, **R5**\), Hoskins created a survey that asked teachers about opportunities for student voice at their schools six months before lockdown, and then what was offered to students when the schools were closed. The questions on opportunities for learning student voice are based on her findings on successful education strategies for learning political engagement that derived from her monograph \( **R5**\). Over 1,000 teachers completed this survey. The results of this exercise show that opportunities for students to have their voice heard and to learn the competences to assert their rights have significantly decreased due to the pandemic, subsequent school closures and lack of appropriate digital solutions. This has affected the vast majority of students, regardless of geographical location and cultural, social and economic differences, although disadvantaged students have lost out further on having their voice heard and learning the competences for democratic culture \( **IMP8**\). 

 Based on the findings of this project, Hoskins proposed eight policy and practice recommendations to develop resilient and high\-quality student voice opportunities within schools. These include building a strong and lively civic culture within the school; the incorporation of student voice initiatives into the school curricula and greater inclusion of disadvantaged students in student voice projects. The research and recommendations from this project were presented at an online conference in November 2020, to 500 teachers, young people, policy makers and researchers from across Europe and the MENA region. Following Hoskins’ recommendations, UNESCO and the CoE have committed to develop a strategy to disseminate the recommendations into education practice across Europe and the MENA region including in the development of a policy brief and further publications to support the enhancement of student voice. These materials will be used by UNESCO and the CoE to support and inspire education ministries, schools, teachers and young people across both regions \( **IMP9**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Heart failure \(HF\) is a major cause of premature death globally, however treatment has been sub\-optimal. Identifying new and efficacious treatments for HF remains a public health priority. UofG researchers have contributed significantly by leading landmark clinical trials assessing new HF therapies. The 2016 UofG\-led PARADIGM\-HF study transformed HF treatment by underpinning the worldwide approval of a new first\-in\-class drug, sacubitril/valsartan—a major breakthrough in HF management since betablockers and other disease\-modifying drugs. Approved in 112 countries, sacubitril/valsartan is used to treat over 1.4 million HF patients worldwide, reducing premature death and hospitalisation rates and is incorporated in international clinical guidelines. Over USD4 billion has been generated in sales since 2015. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 UofG is internationally renowned for its HF research and has led seminal studies that have established the current standard of HF care globally. Prof. John McMurray, a world\-leading clinical triallist, has for over 25 years been studying natriuretic peptides for diagnosing and treating HF with reduced ejection fraction \(HFrEF\)—a condition where insufficient blood is pumped from the heart’s left side. In 2000, Prof McMurray joined Prof. Milton Packer \(then at Columbia University\) on the executive committee of a major randomised trial \(OVERTURE 2002\). This trial demonstrated the potential benefit of inhibiting an enzyme that breaks down natriuretic peptides \(called neprilysin\), in combination with angiotensin\-converting enzyme \(ACE\) inhibitors \(the gold standard HF treatment\), using the combined ACE inhibitor/neprilysin inhibitor, omapatrilat \[3.1\]. Although omapatrilat was not developed further, the trial highlighted the potential of this treatment strategy for reducing HFrEF patient morbidity and mortality. 

 In August 2008, building on a 20\-year history of collaboration, Novartis identified Prof. McMurray to lead studies on a novel angiotensin receptor\-neprilysin inhibitor \(ARNi\), LCZ696 \(sacubitril/valsartan\). McMurray was ideally placed to direct studies of LCZ696 in HFrEF given his previous involvement in numerous major HF\-related clinical trials, such as endothelin receptor antagonism \(VERITAS 2007\), of angiotensin receptor blockers for HFrEF \(CHARM 2003\), and of therapies blocking the renin\-angiotensin\-aldosterone system in HFrEF \(EMPHASIS\-HF 2011\). McMurray directed Novartis to undertake a pharmacokinetic study to demonstrate bioequivalence of the valsartan component of the proposed dose of sacubitril/valsartan with the dose of valsartan shown in previous trials to be effective, to support a subsequent, randomized study. McMurray also proposed and supported the decision to bypass a phase 2 study, citing previous experience with omapatrilat, thereby accelerating the drug development process. McMurray was also instrumental in discussions with Novartis and regulatory authorities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\), that enabled the PARADIGM\-HF phase 3 trial, which was designed to test whether sacubitril/valsartan \(at 200 mg twice daily\) was superior to the ACE inhibitor, enalapril \(10 mg twice daily\), in reducing the risk of cardiovascular \(CV\) death or of HF hospitalisation \[3.2\]. This study was the largest ever drug therapy trial in patients with HFrEF \(8,399 participants\), designed and led by McMurray and Packer \(University of Texas\) as co\-chairs of the steering committee, with Dr Pardeep Jhund as a clinical events adjudication committee member. In 2014, the trial was stopped early by the data monitoring committee due to unequivocal evidence of sacubitril/valsartan’s superiority to enalapril; patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan achieved a sustained and highly significant 20% reduction in the risk of the primary composite end point \(CV death or HF hospitalisation\) and a 16% reduction in all\-cause mortality \[3.2\]. 

 Novartis said, ‘ *Professor McMurray has been instrumental in developing the PARADIGM\-HF study design including discussions with Novartis Senior Management and Health Authorities and his involvement has largely helped to defend the design of the study. His leadership as co\-chair of the study executive committee throughout the study was key for the study planning, execution, and reporting and was highly appreciated by the study investigators and the Novartis study team*.’ \[5.A\] 

 Subsequently, UofG researchers have led PARADIGM\-HF data analyses that have supported submissions to regulatory authorities, demonstrating the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan in patients of all ages \[3.3\]. Other UofG researcher\-led analyses demonstrate the benefits of this drug in specific populations, such as patients with diabetes \[3.4\], and its efficacy at reducing the risk of recurrent hospitalisations \[3.5\], for treating HFrEF in outpatient settings, and its cost effectiveness \[3.6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Heart failure \(HF\) is a condition when the heart cannot meet the body’s demands, with devastating consequences. HF patients have a survival rate of five years post\-diagnosis, reduced quality of life and die prematurely. HF is also a substantial burden on health services; it is the leading cause of hospitalisations for adults over 65 years, costing the NHS over GBP2 billion \(2010\) and the US Medicare system, USD17 billion. 

 Around 50% of HF patients suffer from HF with reduced ejection fraction \(HFrEF\). Prior to the PARADIGM study, HFrEF was treated by ACE inhibitors, the gold standard of treatment for over 25 years. However, ACE inhibitors only partially improve HF, highlighting the need for new and improved drugs to treat HFrEF. PARADIGM\-HF showed that sacubitril/valsartan considerably outperforms ACE inhibitors for treating HFrEF, making it the new gold standard of treatment. With approximately 20 million HF patients in Europe and the US alone, this discovery addresses a substantial, international public health burden. 

 **PARADIGM\-HF supports sacubitril/valsartan as a new HFrEF treatment** 

 In 2014, based on preliminary results from the PARADIGM\-HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan underwent a fast\-track review by the FDA and European Medical Agency \(EMA\); indeed, it was the first CV drug to receive an EMA\-accelerated review. Prof McMurray attended meetings with, and led responses to, questions posed by Health Authorities \[5.A\]. In 2015, Novartis gained regulatory approval for sacubitril/valsartan \(trade name, Entresto\) in the USA \(FDA, July 2015\) under the Accelerated Approval Programme; it was the first non\-cancer drug ever to do so, reflecting the importance of this first\-in\-class \(ARNi\) drug. Approvals followed in Europe \(EMA, Nov 2015\), and, as of 2018, the drug has been approved in 112 countries and launched in over 90, each underpinned by the PARADIGM\-HF findings \[5.A, 5.B\]. 

  

 **Impact on international and national guidelines** 

 Based on key evidence from the PARADIGM\-HF trial and UofG studies, the world’s most influential cardiovascular societies have given sacubitril/valsartan their highest\-level recommendation, including the European Society of Cardiology \(ESC\), American College of Cardiology Foundation \(ACCF\), American Heart Association \(AHA\), and Heart Failure Society of America \(HFSA\) \[‘international guidelines’, 5.C\]. For example: 

-  ESC \(2016\) guidelines on heart failure recommend that ambulatory HFrEF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction \(LVEF\) of <35%, who remain symptomatic \(class I,B recommendation\), are treated with sacubitril/valsartan in place of an ACE inhibitor \[5.C\] 

-  ACC, AHA, and HFSA issued a Class 1 recommendation to <ins>switch</ins> HFrEF patients with LVEF <45%, from ACEi or an ARB to sacubitril/valsartan, as did the Canadian Cardiovascular Society \(CCS\) and the National Heart Foundation of Australia and Cardiac Society of Australia & New Zealand \(NHFA/CSANZ\) guidelines \[5.C\] 

-  The ESC \(2019\) Guidelines on Diabetes, Pre\-Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases, developed in collaboration with the EASD \(European Associations for the Study of Diabetes\) recommend sacubitril/valsartan instead of ACEIs to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and death in patients with HFrEF and type\-2 diabetes who remain symptomatic, despite treatment with ACEIs \(class 1,B\) \[5.C\] 

 Furthermore, in March 2016, the UK guidelines—National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network \(SIGN\)—on HF management, recommended the use of sacubitril/valsartan in adult patients \[5.D\]. The NICE Technology Assessment and Scottish Medicines Consortium review \[5.E\], which both approved the drug for reimbursement, are framed entirely around the PARADIGM\-HF study, with further support drawn from a UofG cost\-effectiveness study \[3.6\]. The NICE expert review panel also highlighted \[5.E\] as particularly relevant to the UK the UofG findings that showed sacubitril/valsartan prevented hospitalisation across all ages, including older patients \[3.3\]. 

 **Changes in prescribing trends for HFrEF** 

 Since the PARADIGM\-HF study, McMurray and Jhund have continued advising Novartis, to support the clinical marketing of sacubitril/valsartan, sitting on advisory boards and delivering lectures, both promotional and non\-promotional. Novartis said, ‘ *Professor McMurray has been a critical medical expert for our global medical education activities to cardiologists during international scientific conferences…*\[His\] *advice as a participant in several advisory board meetings was crucial to inform our understanding of heart failure and best course of action to bring and innovative treatment to patients* \[5.A\]. 

 The ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC’s class I recommendations—to prescribe sacubitril/valsartan to HFrEF patients—widely supported the subsequent upturn in this drug’s prescription, and commercial returns from the drug in the US and EU \[5.F\]. Currently, 25–30% of HFrEF patients in Europe are treated with sacubitril/valsartan, constituting over 1 million people in 2018. In the USA, 5.7 million people have heart failure, of whom 48% have a LVEF of <40%. Allowing for exclusions and other contraindications, around 2.6 million patients stand to benefit from sacubitril/ valsartan. By 2018, in the USA, a significant contributor to increase in prescriptions has been through inclusion in Medicare plans—currently 100% of these plans cover sacubitril/valsartan with an eligible Medicare population of \~1.86 million \[5.G\]. In November 2019, China added the drug to their National Drug Reimbursement Plan, which also increases the volume of patients benefitting. 

 **Improved patient health and quality of life** 

 The treatment of HF patients with sacubitril/valsartan reduced the risk of dying from a cardiovascular cause by 20%, HF hospitalizations by 21%, and the risk of dying from any cause by 16%, relative to enalapril, the previous gold standard treatment. The magnitude of benefit has been observed subsequently in real world studies across international settings \[5.H\]. The optimal implementation of sacubitril/valsartan therapy has been empirically estimated to prevent 28,484 deaths per year in the USA \[5.I\] and, based on a 20% reduction in deaths, equates to 5,700 deaths prevented in the UK. A UofG\-led cost\-effectiveness study suggested an additional 0.91 years of life with treatment on average per patient \[3.6\], which in this patient group for some means a 50–100% increase in life span, and 1.27 million life years saved in the 1.4 million people prescribed to date. 

 **Economic benefits to health services and industry** 

 In the five years following its launch in July 2015, sacubitril/valsartan \(Entresto\) has made USD 4.2 billion in sales for Novartis to July 2020 \[5.A\]. Sacubitril/valsartan has been found to be cost\-effective in the USA, UK and in other developed health care systems. A US cost\-effectiveness study \(co\-authored by McMurray \[5.J\]\) estimated that 220 fewer hospital admissions will occur per 1000 HF patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan, compared to enalapril\-treated patients, over 30 years; this equates to \~19,000 fewer hospitalisations per year among the 2.6 million US individuals eligible for sacubitril/valsartan treatment. Based on real data, it also reduces hospital re\-admissions by 38% after first admission \[5.K\]. A report using real\-world data showed a reduction in all\-cause healthcare costs averaging 28% in the US \(\~USD1,275 per month per patient\) compared with the previous gold standard ACE inhibitors \[5.L\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Changes to regulation, pricing and investment in the utilities sector are essential if the UK is to maintain high standards of public goods provision on the domestic market, and a leading international position. Research at the University of Bath, led by Professor Zalewska, into market risk of utilities has directly influenced regulatory decisions, policy development, and decarbonisation. It shaped the regulatory responses to achieving Net\-Zero 2050 targets by lowering the cost of meeting renewable targets and improving the mix of renewable energy generation. It has also informed the recommendations of the National Infrastructure Commission \(NIC\) to the government with respect to changing the regulatory duties of the UK regulatory authorities. Professor Zalewska’s research has also shaped the infrastructure investment strategy and financing decisions of the Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\) and of the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In markets with low competition \(such as utilities\), it is common for customers to face limited alternative suppliers of services and goods, and to be charged higher prices than would occur in more competitive markets. To protect consumers, regulators restrict companies’ behaviour and put ceilings on their prices. Regulation needs to be adaptive and carefully balanced to the needs of consumers, companies and the economy at large. However, even though regulation has to change to better serve consumers, regulatory changes can increase market risk for companies, which, in turn, may demand higher prices for goods and services. 

 Since 2005, research at the University of Bath \(Zalewska\) in association with the University of Bristol \(Grout\) has addressed factors affecting the market risk of non\-regulated and regulated companies, including the utilities sector. The focus of this research has been the impact of regulation on the development of regulated industries, assessing the effectiveness and fairness of regulatory practices and policies. Zalewska has developed methodologies to enable market risks to be calculated in more precise ways than standard \(static\) methods. Zalewska’s research documents how market risk changes over time and how it is affected by regulatory changes, political uncertainty and changes in market conditions, such as the dot\-com bubble \(R1\). Her research shows that, contrary to what is often claimed, regulatory uncertainty does not imply greater risk and, therefore, is not a justification for raising prices to compensate investors. 

 Zalewska’s research demonstrates how the market risk of utilities changed in the aftermath of the ‘collapse’ of the banking sector during the 2008 financial crisis \(R2\). At the time, there was a general perception that obtaining finance for investment in regulated companies would be more challenging after the 2008 financial crisis and, as a result, regulators should grant higher price ceilings than would have otherwise been the case. However, her research showed that the market risk of the utility sectors in G12 countries did not increase, although, as predicted, it increased for other industrial sectors. The research supported the view that utility companies benefit from the relative security of limited competition and regulated prices, something that is not the case for other businesses \(R2\). 

  

 The research also assessed the impact of changes in the structure of regulation on relative market risk, such as the introduction into energy markets of the RIIO \(Revenue = Incentives \+ Innovation \+ Outputs\) model, and changes in the market risk of bonds. The results suggest that the changes in market risk cannot be attributed to sector\-specific changes in regulation \(R3\) and the market risk of bonds is lower than proposed by regulators \(R4\). 

 Zalewska investigated the regulatory culture surrounding utilities and concluded that there was no evidence of regulatory capture, that is, that the regulators do act in the public interest rather than in the interests of the particular commercial or political groups that dominate the industry \(R5\). A study of the UK Competition Commission’s decision\-making process also found no evidence of regulatory capture \(R6\). Indeed, the research showed that some of its regulatory decisions might be too stringent \(R5, R6\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The UK Government’s Clean Growth Strategy \(2017\) requires investment in renewable electricity development to achieve decarbonisation targets and to deliver a clean and secure supply of electricity at affordable cost. The UK’s model of regulation for energy, water and telecoms also requires adaptation to achieve the Net\-Zero 2050 targets, with UK regulated assets currently worth around GBP144,000,000,000 in energy and water alone \(S1\). 

 Research at the University of Bath \(led by Zalewska\) has significantly influenced the regulatory response to achieving the 2050 targets, as well as affecting the costs associated with investments in renewable energy. The Managing Director at the National Economics Research Associates \(NERA\) explained that “ *her \[Zalewska’s\] academic research and expertise played a key role in shaping the update of electricity generation costs \(and\) in helping the policy makers form confidence around the results and make decisions*” \(S2\). 

 Moreover, the research has impacted the recommendations given by the National Infrastructure Commission \(NIC\) to the government on the direction and cost of investing in the UK’s energy, water and telecom sectors to meet the coming challenges of achieving net zero \(S1\). It also impacted infrastructure investment strategy and financing decisions at the Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\) \(S3a&b\) and the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\) \(S4\). 

 **Influencing Contracts\-for\-Difference \(CfD\) at DECC/BEIS** 

 The UK Government’s Contracts\-for\-Difference \(CfD\) Scheme \(Energy Act 2013\) aims to reduce risks for investors in renewable electricity development through offering a fixed price for the sale of electricity. Assessing the risk of CfD projects, and thus their auction price, is an essential component of the success of the CfD Scheme, because the auction price has a major financial impact on UK citizens and businesses, thereby affecting the competitiveness of the UK economy. 

 In 2015, Zalewska was appointed by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\), to conduct an analysis and to produce a review “ *assessing costs and benefits of energy policies and \[in\] setting administrative strike prices of auctions for low\-carbon CfDs*” \(S5\). Her research into market risk and cost of capital demonstrated that the costs of risk compensation for some renewable technologies should not increase \(S6a, S6b\). The research recommended that the costs of compensation for risk that were proposed by NERA Economic Consulting were too high and that they should not increase between 2015 and 2030 \(S2\). The 2016 BEIS Electricity Generation Report \(S7\) states that, based on the recommendation of Zalewska, “ *hurdle rates stay flat between now and 2030*”. Before the research, for most renewable technologies, FOAK \(first of a kind\) CCS \(carbon capture and storage\) and nuclear, BEIS had used the “ *75% success rate hurdle rates from the NERA report*”. After the research, BEIS “adjusted the NERA 75% success rate hurdle rate by applying a lower effective tax rate to that used by NERA” \(S7p14\). This meant that: 

 “*… following from \[Zalewska’s\] calculations, some of the renewable energy technologies could be more attractive and cheaper to use than the technical studies suggested, impacting both on the anticipated cost of meeting renewable targets and hence the renewable mix*” \(S2\). 

 Indeed, while the first wave of CfD auctions resulted in offshore wind prices of GBP140 to GBP150 per megawatt\-hour \(MWh\), in the 2017 CfD auction, which adopted these recommendations, the price decreased to an average of GBP64 per megawatt\-hour \(MWh\) \(S8\). 

 **Influencing the National Infrastructure Commission** 

 In 2019, Zalewska and Grout were commissioned by the National Infrastructure Commission \(NIC\), which provides impartial advice to the UK government on major infrastructure challenges, to assess the potential impact that changes in the structure of utility regulation might have on the cost of capital of regulated utilities. Their report \(R3\) advised the NIC that significant regulatory changes have had limited effect on the cost of equity and cost of capital for regulated companies. This finding significantly influenced the NIC’s recommendations: 

 “*The evidence does not suggest that the implementation of regulatory policies such as putting more emphasis on environmental performance, the public interest or helping vulnerable customers, would necessarily increase the cost of capital of these companies*” \(S1p46\). 

 Moreover, the recommendation had material effect, because the NIC report states that even a “0.5 percentage point increase in cost of capital for energy and water would raise the amount of revenue that needs to be recovered from consumers by around £720 million \[GBP720,000,000\] a year” \(S1p46\). 

 **Influencing the Civil Aviation Authority and the Competition and Markets Authority** 

 In 2019, Zalewska was commissioned to provide an expert opinion on the cost of debt used by the Civil Aviation Authority \(CAA\), the UK aviation regulator, in setting regulatory requirements for NATS \(En Route\) between 2020 and 2024 \(S3a, S3b\). The research showed that the debt beta estimate of 0.13 used by the CAA was too high \(R4\). The CAA stated that it “ *reviewed a wide range of evidence … including reports from NERA and Professor Zalewska*” \(S3a\) and decided not to follow the advice of Europe Economics, whose calculations suggested a debt beta in the range of 0.19–0.25, but lowered it to 0.1, following the estimations of Zalewska \(R4\). Lowering debt beta has a material impact on the regulatory rate of return, and consequently, the prices charged to consumers and businesses and the earnings of companies. 

 In 2020, Zalewska’s report \(S4\) was used by the Competition and Markets Authority \(CMA\) in resolving a dispute between four water companies and their regulator OFWAT with regard to setting the regulatory requirements for 2020–2025. In relation to the debt beta, the CMA “ *refer specifically to the ‘direct’ econometric estimates of the debt beta put forward by Professor Zalewska in relation to the NATS price redetermination, which indicated that the debt beta was at, or below, 0.1*” \(S4\), and it reduced the OFWAT debt beta from 0.125 to 0.1, impacting directly on how much the water companies are allowed to earn on their investments.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Leigh Landy’s research into listening to, learning about and creating electroacoustic music has changed appreciation and understanding of a genre that was previously almost completely absent from school curricula. An eLearning site, EARS 2, and creative software, Compose with Sounds \(CwS\), have expanded music education and encouraged artistic potential among targeted age groups, particularly pre\- and young teens; by late 2020 there were 20,000 monthly EARS 2 online visitors. Since late October 2013 over 4,000 people \(teachers and students\) around the world have attended hundreds of workshops, classroom sessions and other events. Educational materials are now available in 10 languages, directly resulting in ministries, educators and cultural organisations in 5 countries having promoted the widespread adoption of sound\-based music education in classrooms. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 It is no easy task making innovative music, in this case electroacoustic \(sound\-based, not note\-based\) music, accessible. Although digital electroacoustic sounds are ubiquitous today, the gap between current and potential appreciation and participation levels remains substantial. Over three decades, Landy’s research has aimed to make sound\-based music relevant to music educators and enthusiasts, by determining potential interest, facilitating increased participation and influencing educational policy. 

 **\(1\) EARS \(ELECTROACOUSTIC RESOURCE SITE\) PROJECT** 

 Landy conceived the EARS project in 2001 as a resource, with a glossary, a subject index and a bibliography, that would enable people, mainly university\-level students and professionals, to engage with the challenge of terminology and find literature related to their own interests, see who was working in an area similar to their own, and identify potential gaps in research. Over a six\-year period, over 500 terms and 5,000 bibliographic entries were added and many translated into French, German, Spanish and Italian by an international consortium of specialists \[R1, G1, G2\]. 

 **\(2\) INTENTION/RECEPTION \(I/R\) PROJECT** 

 From 2001, Landy’s I/R project has set out to examine to what extent electroacoustic composers’ intentions are being received by listeners of various levels of experience, and to what extent listeners with no previous experience of electroacoustic music might be interested in further exposure to similar works. From 2003 to 2007 in Leicestershire, and in 2019 \(as part of Interfaces\) \[G5\] elsewhere in the UK and Greece, around 800 participants from schools and workshops completed questionnaires and talked informally during and after a music session. A quantitative data analysis showed that electroacoustic works are more accessible than the researchers anticipated: between 55% and 79% of listeners were interested in further exposure to sound\-based music. Data gained from this project led Landy to his educational initiatives, in particular, EARS 2/​CwS \[R2\]. 

 **\(3\) SOUND ORGANISER \(LATER, COMPOSE WITH SOUNDS, OR CwS\)** 

 In 2007 Landy organised the design of a prototype for Sound Organiser, audio software that is based on a computer games approach: the higher the level one reaches, the greater the palette of opportunities and challenges on offer. In 2013 this was renamed and launched as Compose with Sounds \(CwS\) \[R4\], an intuitive, easy\-to\-learn, free composition software with powerful forms of sound manipulation which allow users to compose music creatively with any sounds. 

 **\(4\) EARS 2** 

 In 2008 UNESCO, a supporter of EARS, asked Landy to create an ‘EARS for children’. With DMU education specialist Dr Motje Wolf, Landy investigated the feasibility of supporting several countries’ national curricula for music while broadening the horizon of their offer in terms of sonic creativity \[G3–G5\]. Wolf created EARS 2 Teachers’ Packs, and in 2012 Landy published the first comprehensive book on sonic creativity for teachers working with 11\- to 14\-year\-olds, *Making Music with Sounds* \[R3\]. Its structure ensured that EARS 2 could be easily navigated by music novices. The incorporation of CwS into EARS 2 in 2013 offered a complete learning and creative environment for people, especially students at Key Stage 3 with no previous knowledge of sound\-based music \[R5\]. Extensive user feedback from the start has led to continual enhancements \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Professor Landy’s research into electroacoustic music made a compelling case for its accessibility in terms of both appreciation and activity, and informed its inclusion in the music education and creative participation of young people aged 11–14, older students and adults in countries across the world. The resources have been translated into French, Spanish, Greek, Czech, Portuguese, Italian, German, Swedish and Norwegian and endorsed by ministries of education and cultural organisations in Greece, Cyprus, France, the UK and Mexico. In December 2020 there were 20,210 visitors to the website, almost double the previous peak of 11,025 visitors in January 2018 \[C1\]. 

 **\(1\) IMPACT ON LEARNING AND PARTICIPATION: ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN SONIC CREATIVITY** 

 From 2011 to 2013, the EU’s cultural programme supported the CwS initiative, focusing on the creation of the initial CwS platform for EARS 2. The platform was widely used in \(mainly\) secondary schools in the UK, France, Germany, Greece, Norway and Portugal, and its website went live in October 2013. 

 For their compositions, music students collected a diversity of sounds, from the domestic \(a coffee cup clattering in the sink\) to the ethereal \(a waterfall in a gorge\) and, with the help of teachers and composers, transformed them into a piece of music with the software. A teacher at the Conservatoire in Bourges, France, said about the composition ‘Retour aux Sources’: ‘I only used sounds in this piece that were generated by the children as part of their activities related to inventing sounds and composing with them’ \[C2\]. 

 Between 2016 and 2019, Landy and Wolf worked with the Leicester\-Shire Music Education Hub, a collaboration of local educators, composers and community artists, to develop and run 47 EARS 2/​CwS workshops with more than 400 participants at 7 schools \(ages 9–15\) in Leicester, Leamington Spa and Coventry, as well as 3 community settings \(with a wider age range\). When asked if they would like to listen to or make sound\-based compositions again, participants’ responses included: ‘Yes, because the sounds sound like music, even if they originally weren’t’ \(Year 5, girl\); ‘It’s fun to find new sounds and experiment with them’ \(Year 9, boy\); and ‘I really enjoyed the opportunity to be creative and express my own ideas’ \(teacher\) \[C3\]. A Year 6 music teacher praised the teachers’ resources as previously the subject had been ‘out of her comfort zone’ \[C4\]. 

 The head of music technology at the Hub, said that EARS 2/​CwS ‘demands no musical literacy’ and can be ‘shared by all’. ‘EARS 2 is what one might call a “complete curriculum”, covering a wide range of topics \(breadth\) at various learning levels \(depth\). As far as I know, it is completely unique and also extremely valuable, not least in terms of our National Curriculum’ \[C4\]. Although further workshops have been largely on hold during 2020, he has formally recommended the ‘low\-anxiety’ resources for use in other hubs’ geographic areas on the website \[C4\]. 

 **\(2\) IMPACT ON CULTURE AND SOCIETY: BRINGING NEW MUSIC TO NEW AUDIENCES** 

 Following the success of the CwS project, from June 2016 to September 2020 DMU was a partner in the EU’s Interfaces project \[C5\] with the aim of ‘bringing new music to new audiences’ through community arts projects, performances, site\-specific events and workshops. Besides funding the phase 2 development of EARS 2/​CwS \(e.g. multiple languages\) \[G6\], Interfaces has enabled translations and workshop opportunities, as well as creating pathways for official endorsements \(NB: EARS 2 was cyber\-attacked in May 2018 and not publicly available for a number of months until fully rebuilt; CwS also underwent significant recoding due to Windows/​Mac OS upgrades as reflected in, for example, C3\). 

 A freelance composer and musician conducted community workshops in 2017 and 2018 for adults aged 18 and over in the UK and Greece, involving 230 school students, 70 tertiary students, 60 adults in community workshops, 10 teachers and 77 experts \[C5\]. Referring to the eLearning platform and software as ‘intuitive for starters’, he says: ‘Our experiences with \[them\] have clearly demonstrated that, not only is this a way of engaging more people in creative practice, but it offers a unique “way in” to a wider range of participants than many of the more traditional genre\-based approaches’ \[C3\]. He continued to use EARS 2/​CwS during the pandemic, in online workshops for young people organised by Scotland’s Sound Festival in April 2020 \[C3\]. 

 In 2018 Landy conducted a two\-day workshop in Prague for 60 HE students from Charles University and the National Academy of Performing Arts \(AMU\). An Associate Professor of Composition at AMU wrote: ‘Many Charles students \[media\] not only plan to use the software again, but are enthusiastic about using sound\-based sampling in their work’. ‘\[One\] of the participants, having been introduced to the EARS 2 website in your first day session even proposed to make a Czech version of it’. She completed this in 2020. Some documentation of the workshop can be found \[C7\]. 

 **\(3\) IMPACT ON MUSIC EDUCATION POLICY: PROMOTING SOUND\-BASED MUSIC LESSONS IN SCHOOLS** 

 With the implementation of language translations and cultural adaptations to the new versions of EARS 2/​CwS in the late 2020, benefits have been achieved in a number of countries where ministries, cultural institutions and music education specialists have advocated for the widespread adoption of the revised resources and tools in schools. 

 In the UK, Sound and Music, an affiliate of Arts Council England that supports the creation and enjoyment of new music, has endorsed EARS 2/​CwS for use in schools and workshops on its website and in newsletters to young people and educators, reaching 325 and 987 people respectively \[C6\]. 

 In 2014 in Cyprus, the music inspector for secondary education at the Ministry of Education and Culture, says: ‘The Ministry made the decision to recommend the use of Compose with Sounds in our Music Schools and in the music classroom as part of our national curriculum’. In consequence there is an ‘increased number of events in Cyprus that include electroacoustic music and concerts with electroacoustic music compositions from our students’ \[C8\]. It was the first country to do so following a workshop by Landy and a music technology teacher in Cyprus \[C8\]. Since then, 250 students have been introduced to the software \[C8\]. 

 After introductions in schools in Greece in 2014 and again in 2017 from our partner, Ionian University \[C9\], teachers felt that they needed a Greek\-language learning environment. An online demonstration of EARS 2/CwS and its potential in educational contexts in late 2020, attended by over 150 teachers and which remains available online, prompted the Greek Society for Music Education \(GSME\) to recommend EARS 2/​CwS for use in all Greek schools, especially at post\-primary level \(> 3,000 schools\) \[C9\]. Without a national curriculum, GSME is where ‘music teachers come for information on new valuable developments’, says the GSME president. ‘We feel it is our responsibility to encourage dynamic, up to date music teaching. Making music with sounds is something that \[children\] should all learn about and make’ \[C9\]. 

 Mexico’s National Centre for Music and Sonic Arts \(CMMAS\) provides local, state and national authorities with suggestions regarding educational tools for music and encourages their integration into schools’ music programmes. Following their translation and cultural adaptation \(which CMMAS oversaw\) into Spanish in 2020, ‘these resources are now ideal for Mexican and Latin American schools’, says the director of CMMAS. ‘We are officially endorsing their use … particularly for late primary and early secondary levels and for community artists working in the field’. He added that, ‘the ability for children to quickly become enthusiastic and well informed about various forms of electro\-acoustic music is just what our schools need. Offering them the chance to be creative and gain confidence in their creativity regardless of available tools is just what our country needs’ \[C10\]. 

 In France, the Inspé d’Aix\-Marseille \(National Higher Institute of Education and Teaching at Aix\-Marseille University\) ‘trains and provides guidance and recommendation to primary and secondary school teachers in France’. Their team ‘made a rigorous analysis of the pedagogical approach provided by this resource’ and concluded that EARS 2/​CwS ‘offer a major contribution to the pedagogy of acousmatic music’ and ‘make a major contribution to the development of the abilities of a large number of students regarding the perception and production of electroacoustic music’. The platforms support ‘the development of their skills in the two central activities of the French musical education curriculum: perception and production’ \[C11\].

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Two evidence\-based interventions in the prison service have resulted in direct benefits to prison staff, prisoners and broader society. McDougall’s research on serious offenders shows that behaviour monitoring in prison can predict risk of reoffending after release. She has also shown that the introduction of digital technology terminals \(for prisoners to request visits, health care, order food, etc.\) brings significant benefits to behaviour within prisons and enhances rehabilitation. The research on behaviour monitoring provided empirical evidence relevant to difficult policy areas \(e.g., managing prisoner release\), and has resulted in significant institutional change. Enhanced Behaviour Monitoring was made mandatory in all pre\-release prisons, and became a mandatory part of decisions on temporary release. The research on digital technology explored the feasibility of expanding self\-service terminals for prisoners across public sector prisons, informing the Justice Minister’s 2018 announcement of GBP7,000,000 to fund the introduction of digital kiosks in UK prisons and the implementation of digital technology in prisons across three states in Australia. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research on behaviour monitoring involves a series of studies conducted by McDougall which had the overall aim of examining difficult policy areas and building an evidence base to inform interventions to improve prisoner behaviour and reduce reoffending. Torgerson’s contribution was to design and oversee the research assessing the impact of digital technology in a range of prisons. Kanaan and Martin were involved in drawing up the Benefits Realisation Methodology \( **5.6**\) to aid decisions relating to further roll out of digital technology in HM prisons. All of the references in Section 3 include a co\-author from the Probation Trust. 

 A continuing area of concern is risk assessment of serious offenders, which is particularly difficult with offenders who have spent long periods in prison. McDougall’s research was originally conducted on life sentence prisoners who had committed murder, and demonstrated that behaviours that contributed to the original offence were still observed in prison and could be used retrospectively to assess ongoing risk. In 2010, following a number of high\-profile murders committed by offenders after release, McDougall developed a prospective model using data on high\-risk prisoners, whose in\-prison behaviour \(recorded by prison officers\) had been monitored and was compared against their behaviour in the year after release \( **3.1**\). In comparison with traditional interview\-based assessment methods, behavioural research demonstrated that the model could significantly predict those who would commit a serious offence after release, or be recalled for risk\-related behaviour \( **3.2**\). This procedure of using in\-prison behaviour to predict criminal activity after release is now known as *Enhanced Behaviour Monitoring* \(EBM\). In addition to the publications in English language journals, this research was published by invitation in a French language journal \( **3.3**\). 

 A second strand of research on improving prisoner behaviour was commissioned to investigate the institutional benefits of introducing prisoner self\-service technology. Prisons are acknowledged to be inefficient, with little technology available for the use of officers or prisoners. Systems are mainly paper\-based, with any requests for visits, food ordering, changes of employment, education and health care being processed by hand by officers. This leads to delays and errors, which are acknowledged to be a major cause of tension and assaults on staff. In addition to the benefits in efficiency of self\-service technology, McDougall recognised its potential to rehabilitate, developing a Theory of Change which proposed that prisoners’ acquisition of skills and increased responsibility would lead to positive psychological and social changes. 

 This research was instrumental in the introduction of prisoner self\-service kiosks, with the system initially being rolled out in private prisons. The introduction of the kiosks was associated with a significant decrease of 22% in disciplinary adjudications over two years; in addition, staff sick absence was reduced by 12%. In due course, reoffending by those who had experienced the technology was reduced by 5% in the first year after release in comparison with those who had not experienced the technology \( **3.4**\). This reference is the only empirical published study on the positive impact of self\-service technology on rehabilitation and re\-offending, and led to an invitation to contribute to a book on international cyberdeviance and cybercrime, incorporating a previously unpublished Process Evaluation \( **3.5**\). Following presentation of the empirical evidence shown above, McDougall was commissioned by the HM Prison and Probation Services \(HMPPS\) Director of Digital Change to conduct new research examining the feasibility of rolling out digital technology across the whole public prison estate.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The beneficiaries of McDougall’s research are \(a\) policymakers who have used the research to inform criminal justice policies, \(b\) prison staff and prisoners whose wellbeing has been improved by the implementation of findings from the research, and \(c\) the general public who are less likely to be the victims of crime due to the impact of the research on the rate of re\-offending. 

##  Benefits to Policymakers 

 The research on behaviour monitoring was commissioned by the Probation Trust Director of Public Protection \(who co\-authored **3.2** & **3.3**\) and was funded \(as acknowledged in **3.2**\) by the current Director General of Prisons, who at that time was the Regional Director of Offender Management, and later seconded to the Ministry of Justice’s Strategy Unit \( **5.1**\). Further interest was shown by HM Assistant Chief Inspector of Probation, who had investigated one of the high profile re\-offences that prompted the research \(Serious Further Offence Case – Anthony Rice, 2006\) \( **5.1**\). The research has provided senior managers of prison and probation with an evidence base for policy development on risk assessment of life sentence prisoners. In 2015, a Prison Service Instruction on EBM was issued. This instruction was mandatory for all 14 Category D open prisons in the UK \(housing around 7,000 prisoners\), from which the most serious offenders are usually released. The 2015 Instruction made it mandatory for reports on EBM of offenders to be reviewed by forensic psychologists before offenders were released \( **5.2**\). 

 Evidence that EBM was being used and received positively was corroborated in independent documents. EBM was acknowledged in a High Court Hearing as being used effectively as part of a Progression Regime in a Category C prison. Evidence of EBM in action was reported in an Unannounced Chief Prison Inspector’s Report on HMP Warren Hill, October 2015, as follows: “4.26 The EBM process, supported by an effective key worker scheme, enabled the prison to monitor prisoners’ attitudes, behaviour and thinking and to respond to risk issues” \( **5.2**\). In May 2019, the EBM Prison Service Instructions were upgraded to the status of mandatory permanent Policy Frameworks \( **5.2**\). 

 Following the introduction of EBM, an additional policy, Release on Temporary Licence \(ROTL\), was amended, making it mandatory for very high risk prisoners being considered for ROTL to be first registered for EBM. This strengthened the importance of EBM as a risk assessment tool. References to the mandatory use of EBM are made throughout the Prison Service Instruction on ROTL, and the risk assessment section states that the EBM case file must be considered when reviewing the main Prison Service risk assessment database \( **5.3**\). In May 2019, the ROTL Prison Service Instructions were upgraded to the status of mandatory permanent Policy Frameworks \( **5.3**\). Policy interest in the research extended to France, where McDougall was invited to present a paper to a criminal justice conference, and to collaborate with the University of Reims to put the research into practice in the French prison service \( **5.4**\). 

 An internal report on McDougall’s self\-service technology research was widely circulated in 2016 within HMPPS. Policy interest was evident when HMPPS Director of Digital Change, having attended a seminar on the research, commissioned further research to investigate the feasibility of implementing digital technology across public sector prisons in order to inform policy on how the technology should be implemented. Performance measures were monitored on two \(1,000 prisoner\) ‘proof of concept’ prisons, and staff and prisoner focus groups were conducted. Results showed positive improvements in assaults against staff, prisoner complaints, disciplinary adjudications, self\-harm and staff sickness \( **5.5**\). After the technology had been in place for 9 months, an interim evaluation report was completed and a cost benefit analysis was included in an HMPPS Business Case to the Ministry of Justice \( **5.6**\). In July 2018, the Justice Minister published his strategy for security, decency and rehabilitation \( **5.7**\). This included an announcement of proposed expenditure of GBP7,000,000 on in\-cell telephony and digital kiosks in prisons. This was the first time the potential use of digital kiosks in public sector prisons had been publicly announced by the Ministry of Justice. The contract to supply digital technology to prisons has subsequently been expanded to cover over 40 prisons in the UK \( **5.8**\). 

 The research on digital technology has also achieved impact overseas. McDougall was invited to present a webinar for senior prison managers in Australia in 2016. As a result of this presentation, self\-service technology has been used for the past three years in fifteen Australian prisons \(in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia\), housing around 5,000 prisoners \( **5.8**\). 

##  Benefits to prison staff and prisoners 

 In the case of prison staff, the EBM and ROTL schemes place more responsibility for risk assessment on prison officers, who know the prisoners well, having observed them in a range of situations. This new responsibility raises the status of the prison officer, and demonstrates their ability to provide risk information. As for the prisoners, they are informed of the benefits of EBM and ROTL procedures in reducing their likelihood of reoffending \( **5.1 – 5.3**\). 

 It is evident from focus groups with prison staff and prisoners that the introduction of technology is popular. It relieves officers of the mundane routine tasks involved with handling paper\-based requests, freeing them to do more skilled work. It is popular with the majority of prisoners as it gives them more self\-responsibility, and results in less tension with prison officers. The positive impact on performance measures described above empirically demonstrates improvement in well\-being for both staff and prisoners \( **5.5**\). The evident motivation of prisoners to learn new skills highlights the potential use of technology in the context of prisoner rehabilitation. 

##  Benefits to Society 

 Society will benefit from the mandatory introduction of EBM and its inclusion in ROTL through the associated reduction in crime and reoffending in high\-risk offenders. Digital technology also greatly improves efficiency in prisons and therefore reduces the costs of imprisonment. Savings to tax payers are evident in \(a\) increased efficiency as a result of the implementation of digital technology due to the reduction in staff absences, prisoner disciplinary procedures and assaults on staff \( **5.5, 5.6 and 3.4**\), and \(b\) the reduction in police and court costs as a result of the decreased rate of reoffending \( **5.6, 3.4**\).

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Academy soccer players play 40\-50 matches per season and travel to play matches. Sleep, recovery and wellbeing are crucial for performance and health. The findings from this research have impacted day\-to\-day practices of two English Premier League 2 Academy Clubs. Changes include: players being given more time to sleep and rest following away matches and losses, a hotel stay\-over in the location of the match, later training start\-times, prescribing recovery practices for players to undertake at home and giving players a day off. This has led to improved training practices and player recovery. Furthermore, the findings have increased awareness of the importance of psychological support for injured players. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The underpinning research for this impact case study has been conducted by Harper and Naughton at the University of Huddersfield \(UoH\). The investigations have been undertaken in collaboration with colleagues from external organisations and institutions: Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club \(Dr Will Abbott\), Liverpool John Moores University \(Dr Thomas Brownlee\), Loughborough University \(Dr Tom Clifford\), Newcastle University \(Andy Richardson\) and Edge Hill University \(Dr Richard Page\). 

 The main focus of the research has been on assessing subjective wellbeing and mental fatigue in Professional English academy soccer players. Professional soccer is characterised by high training and match loads, with risk of overtraining, injuries and psychosocial disorders. Therefore, players’ recovery and readiness to train is often assessed via objective and subjective measurement tools. This enables practitioners and coaches to modulate their training schedules and practices, in order to facilitate optimal restoration and adaptation. 

 The purpose of our research was to assess the impact of contextual \(location, result and quality of opposition\) factors of match\-play on subjective markers of wellbeing and mental fatigue, as well as the impact of injury, match selection and training load on mental wellbeing. 

 <ins> **Factors that influence</ins> <ins>player</ins> <ins>subjective</ins> <ins></ins><ins>wellbeing</ins> <ins>– Paper 3.1**</ins> 

 Research carried during the 2016/2017 English Premier League 2 season revealed that match location, result and the quality of opposition all negatively influence the subjective wellbeing \(in particular mood, stress and sleep quality\) of under\-23 soccer players for up to three days post\-match, irrespective of the physical demands of the matches. Further, both playing away matches and losing \(independently of each other\) caused significantly higher stress and lower sleep quality and mood compared to playing at home, or winning. Furthermore, irrespective of result, players had significantly greater fatigue and stress, and lower mood following matches against top\-table, high quality opponents compared to lower quality opposition. 

 <ins> **Injury as a compounding factor</ins> <ins>– Paper 3.2**</ins> 

 Research conducted during the 2017/2018 English Premier League 2 season revealed that players’ mental wellbeing \(measured using the Warwick\-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale; WEMWBS\) was significantly and clinically meaningfully lower when injured compared to when they were not injured, with the length of time spent injured and not being selected for matches the main factors that explained this. Training load did not appear to significantly impact WEMWBS scores. 

 <ins> **Factors that contribute to mental fatigue</ins> <ins>– Paper 3.3**</ins> 

 As mental fatigue has been shown to negatively impact aspects of physical, skill, tactical and perceptual\-cognitive performance, and as coaches and players have identified mental fatigue as an issue throughout the professional football season, further research also carried out during the 2017/2018 English Premier League 2 season aimed to assess players’ mental fatigue, using a visual analogue scale, throughout the season. The research revealed that players report significantly higher mental fatigue following matches, which persists for three days following the match. Furthermore, players’ mental fatigue response was closely correlated with other measures of subjective wellness such as muscle soreness, fatigue, sleep quality and motivation to train. Players’ mental fatigue response was particularly impacted by losing compared to winning and drawing, with significantly higher mental fatigue values reported following matches that were lost compared to won or drawn.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research described in this case study has revealed impact in two main areas: 

1.  Improved post\-match recovery practices 

1.  Enhanced support for player wellbeing. 

 **Improved post\-match recovery practices** 

 The findings from paper 3.1 led to changes to post\-match recovery practices for two English Premier League Academy clubs \(C1 and C2\). The majority of English Premier League 2 matches are played in the evening \(19:00\). As such, matches typically finish at 20:50. Factoring in the time for players to return to the changing rooms, shower, dress and return to the team bus, it may be as late as 22:00\-22:30 that a team would begin their journey home. If the club is competing away from home, and depending on the location of their opponents, the players may not arrive at their residences until as late as 04:00. In paper 3.1, we observed lower subjective ratings of sleep on the day following an away match. As a result, C2 adopted a policy of staying in a hotel in the town/city of their opponents on the night of the match: *“the lower subjective ratings of sleep on MD\+1 compared to MD contributed to our decision to ‘stay over’ after away games with an evening KO and requiring >3hrs return travel. The rationale included providing a more nutritious and substantial meal at the hotel, quickly after the game and the opportunity for the players to retain their typical sleep routines before travelling back on MD\+1”* \[5.2\]. 

 Coaching staff were particularly interested in the findings of decreased subjective wellness on the day following a match, as this was their typical time for delivering post\-match analysis \(e.g., highlighting strengths and weaknesses from the match using video\). This led to a change in the timing of these analysis sessions \[5.2\]. 

 C1 changed their training prescription based on the findings of the study, with the weekly microcycle being structured differently following an away match compared with a home match. This included asking players to report to the training ground the day after an away match three to four hours later than usual to allow for more sleep. This led to improved subjective ratings of muscle soreness and fatigue on the day following a match, as well as improved mood and sleep, leading to enhanced quality of training \[5.1\]. 

 C2’s practices on the day following a match also changed, with either the training session being delayed until later in the day, allowing the players to complete a ‘home based’ recovery session, or giving the players a day off. Overall, the findings of the paper led to C2 using their subjective wellness data when making decisions on training prescription across the whole season \[5.2\]. 

 The findings from paper 3.3, where players’ subjective ratings of mental fatigue were significantly higher following a loss compared to a win changed C1’s approach to training following a loss, giving the players more time off to recover before analysing the previous match and training. They felt that this would then provide the players with more time to recover both mentally and physically and have a heightened receptiveness to tactical information, as well as physical training \[5.1\]. 

 **Enhanced support for player wellbeing** 

 The findings from paper 3.2 led to changes in the wellbeing support for players at C1. The significantly lower ratings of mental wellbeing from injured players highlighted that there was a need not just for physical support, but also for further psychological support, for injured players: *“…that really highlighted for us the importance of… the psychological support around injury, not just the physical support around injury. So as a consequence… we’ve touched base with our Psychology Department. We’ve actually, as a Club, from this season onwards, recruited Mental Wellbeing Practitioners and we’ve got access to Applied Counsellors as well...”* \[5.1\]. 

 These findings helped stimulate discussions around the importance of mental health for academy footballers and established a mental wellbeing service at C1. The club now administers the questionnaire used in the study \(Warwick\-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale\) to players every week, to assess changes in mental well\-being across the season, in order to stimulate conversations and identify interventions as necessary. This has led to a culture change in the organisation and increased the importance of assessing mental wellbeing \[5.1\]. 

 Taken together, all three papers have had an impact at C1 on the relationship between the performance staff and the coaching staff, with increased objectivity and application of empirical evidence to the coaching process and day\-to\-day practices \[5.1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Sensory Play Toolkit is a free, caregiver\-led, evidence\-based intervention for children with picky eating. To date, it has provided practical, interactive strategies and support for parents, professionals, and organisations from 38 countries \(n = 2,500 individuals\), for whom there is currently a dearth of resources. The impact generated includes: 

1.  reduced parental anxiety and improved parental management of eating problems after using the toolkit. 

1.  use of the Toolkit by the charity ARFID Awareness as a support resource for parents on their website. 

1.  Professionals including dietitians, occupational therapists and psychologists, changing their practice to include the toolkit at treatment outset, to reduce anxiety and provide information. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Picky eating describes the rejection of a wide range of familiar and novel foods. Picky eating is common in childhood \(up to 40% of 2–7\-year\-olds\) and can have a profound impact on child diet and family mealtime functioning. Since 2015, cases of extreme avoidance of a wide range of foods and poor health / psychosocial functioning can be given the new diagnosis of ARFID \(Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\), a lifespan clinical disorder. Picky eating and ARFID can negatively impact a person’s physical health and psychological well\-being; children may not get essential nutrients needed for health, development, or ability to function due to the narrow range of foods consumed. Treatments for picky eating and ARFID are still in their infancy and proof of effectiveness is yet to be demonstrated. At present, no standardised materials are available to families or health/​childcare professionals to support parents and children with these eating patterns. There is, therefore, a real need for help and support for children who are picky, avoidant, or fussy eaters, and those with the new diagnosis of ARFID, for whom no clear assessment or treatment pathway currently exists. In such children, an increase in tasting of even one food can lead to psychosocial benefits, such as the ability to eat at a family mealtime, party, picnic, café or restaurant. 

 The underpinning research conducted at DMU focused on helping children develop positive relationships with foods and widen dietary intake. The Health Psychology Research Cluster in the Institute of Psychological Science \(led by Dr Helen Coulthard\) have published novel research into the relationship between sensory play and food acceptance. Research was first published from our group showing an association between food rejection and tactile sensitivity in preschool children in both questionnaire \(n = 70; R1\) and behavioural \(n = 63; R2\) studies. The results showed that children who liked the sensation of sticky messy substances on their hands rejected fewer novel foods. Our team have also identified associations between food rejection and sensory engagement with foods in clinical samples of children with ARFID \(n = 39; R3\). We have further provided evidence for a variety of sensory activities and games to increase food acceptability for children with and without picky eating. These include making pictures out of real fruits and vegetables based on the picture book *The Hungry Caterpillar’*\(n = 62; R4\), playing bingo with real fruits and vegetables \(n = 102; R5\), and a five\-week non\-taste sensory play intervention encompassing ten games, including making raspberries into finger puppets and rescuing toy animals from goo \(n = 100; R6, supported by external funding from the Feeding for Life Foundation, GBP49,000\). All outputs found increases in tasting relative to control conditions. 

 These findings support the theory that familiarisation with the sensory characteristics of foods without pressure to try, may have made children more comfortable with the foods, and consequently, more likely to taste them. Based on our underpinning research, in 2017 we carried out sensory play impact workshops with 200 Leicester\-based schoolchildren, and from these, 15 child\-tested sensory games and activities were compiled into a toolkit. The toolkit emphasises creativity and fun to maximise the message of food play and pleasure\-based eating. 

 
The aim of the toolkit was threefold; to profile the child’s eating and sensory behaviour, to desensitise children to multiple sensory stimuli through play, and to help them develop more positive \(and less fearful\) relationships with food. The design of the toolkit also ensured that it could be used by an adult who knew the child, such as a parent, making it a low cost and sustainable form of intervention.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 


 
 

##  \(1\) Distribution and reach 

 The findings of our research have had had press coverage nationally and internationally through, for instance, *VICE*, the *Daily Mail,* and multiple parenting websites \[C1\]. Aldridge appeared on *Women’s Hour* on Radio 4 \(an average of 3,700,000 listeners\), where she discussed the importance of sensory exposure in clinical groups of children with feeding problems \[C2\]. 

 The toolkit is a 28\-page paper workbook that parents and children can fill in together. Since the Covid\-19 pandemic, the toolkit has been disseminated in a printable online format through charities \(ARFID Awareness UK\), support groups on Facebook \(e.g. Parents of picky eaters and problem feeders\) and professional networks \(Education Standards Board, Australia; Eating and Feeding in Childhood Network, UK\). To achieve this, a website was created with a portal to download the toolkit \[C3\]. To date, the toolkit has been downloaded approximately 2,500 times since June 2020 but is also being distributed by health professionals to their clients \(1,500 professionals with an average of 32.3 clients = 52,339 users \[C3, C4\]\). The toolkit has been downloaded and used by health professionals from 38 countries. Though the majority have been from Australia and the UK, health professionals in countries as diverse as Iceland, Mexico, Zimbabwe, Qatar and Singapore have also used the toolkit \(see C3 for distribution statistics\). 

##  \(2\) Professional impact 

 Professionals from multiple disciplines have downloaded the toolkit \(n = 1,500\), or have received paper copies \(n = 300\), including occupational therapists \(n = 445\), educators / child support workers \(n = 277\), dietitians \(n = 270\), clinical psychologists \(n = 103\), speech and language therapists \(n = 146\), and doctors/​nurses \(n = 61\) \[C3, C4\]. A professional evaluation \(n = 75\) found that the majority of professionals stated that it was a useful information/​support resource for clients who demonstrate sensory processing issues and food refusal \(98%\), and that it was helping them in their practice \(98%\). Furthermore, of the professionals surveyed, most reported that they had subsequently changed their practice to include the toolkit \(84%\) as a resource to distribute to their clients for initial reassurance and information \[C4\]. 

 Their feedback about the toolkit was overwhelmingly positive, for example some professionals stated that it: 

 1 supported and changed their practice: 

 ‘It's a very helpful guide to practical things to do at home which is hard to explain in a consultation, and a support to do these things at home’ \(dietitian, NHS, UK\) 

 ‘It helped me develop my practice’ \(child psychologist, Bulgaria\) 

 2 helped their clients while they were undergoing treatment: 

 ‘I think it helps parents be more realistic about their expectations. It helps the parent understand the child. It moves at a pace for the child.’ \(dietitian, NHS, UK\) 

 ‘Giving parents an activity to do with children where eating the food is not the focus. Takes pressure off parents. Gives practical support.’ \(dietitian, NHS, UK\) 

 3 helped during the Covid pandemic when many groups had been closed: 

 ‘It was useful during covid\-19 when we are unable to run our “fun with food” groups’ \(occupational therapist, NHS, UK\). 

 ‘Due to the current coronavirus I was looking for a tool for parents to use to reduce sensory aversion’ \(speech and language therapist, NHS, UK\). 

 This evidence of change from the professional evaluation is also evident in two testimonials taken from health professionals who work with ARFID. A child psychologist from the Birmingham Food Refusal Service stated, ‘Parents have reported back to me that they have found the interactive games very useful, giving them new ideas for approaching the difficult task of sensory desensitisation’ \[C5\]. An NHS dietitian stated, ‘There is good information for parents and \[it\] validates what they are experiencing’ \[C6\]. Both emphasised that there was a lack of resources to support their practice, and they had changed their practice to include the Sensory Play Toolkit. 

##  \(3\) Parental impact 

 To date, approximately 1,000 parents have independently downloaded the toolkit for use with their children. Over 50% of the children were reported as having comorbid diagnoses, including autism \(n = 116\), sensory processing disorder \(n = 404\), and ARFID \(n = 99 diagnosed, n = 50 suspected\). 

 In a subsample of caregivers, use of the toolkit for a period of 4–6 weeks led to decreases in parental anxiety, parental problems managing their child’s eating behaviour, and problematic eating behaviour in children, relative to the baseline \(n = 29; C7\). Qualitative data from parents showed increases in sensory play \(‘I've learnt to relax around messy play’, Parent 5, UK; ‘The games were fun and engaging’, Parent 24, UK\) and in tasting \(‘We’ve had some success with moving away from white bread and she has now tried 50/50 bread which is a big step’, Parent 4, UK\), as well as increased knowledge about the strategies used \(‘The sensory chaining really clicked with me and made it easier to understand how to get my child to try new things’ Parent 7, UK\). 

 Organisations have added the toolkit to their websites as a resource tool, such as the charity ARFID Awareness UK, who state: 

 Resources are very important to our charity, as we support parents, carers and individuals who aren’t getting the support they need from the NHS – either practically, or emotionally. Having something like the toolkit enables us to empower the people we support with something practical that they can do to tackle ARFID … the toolkit gives parents hope and allows them to feel like they can ‘do something’. \[C8, Co\-founder of ARFID Awareness\] 

 Coulthard has also been a consultant on *Easy Ways to Live Well*, with Hugh Fearnley\-Whittingstall \[C9\], which aired on 5<sup>th</sup> February 2020. A family of three children \(3, 7 and 10 years\) who showed extreme picky eating at the beginning of the programme adopted the sensory games over an 8\-week period. All children showed increased dietary variety, introducing 9–16 healthy new foods into their diet including, rice, pears, green beans and spinach. In the programme, the mother stated, ‘This was my dream … mealtimes are no longer a battle … the pressure has been taken off’ \(C9, lines 1055\-1064\); and the children said ‘Mummy’s not forced me to eat anything…it’s been really good’ \(C9, lines 1044\-1046\). Hugh Fearnley\-Whittingstall concluded, ‘That is a family enjoying their food in ways that a few months ago was impossible … all the tension has gone out of the situation…the kids are willing to try new stuff’ \(C9, lines 1076\-1081\). Sensory play was also featured on the BBC website, as one of ‘Eight simple things you can do to live better’: Banish fussy eating by … letting kids play with their food \[C10\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The global value of inland fisheries exceeds GBP83 billion and supports 0.25 billion people \(Food and Agriculture Organisation, 2018\). The ecological services value of river fish diversity likely far exceeds the fishery value, through processes such as nutrient transport and ecosystem engineering. Dr Lucas’ team demonstrated that various river fish species rely on free movement much more than previously recognised and that even small, engineered, river structures can act as barriers, including for economically important and conservation\-listed species \(Figure\). In this regard the research has promoted the conservation of fish diversity, including exploited species, in rivers impacted by humans in 73 countries. The Durham team demonstrated that conventional fish passes can be ineffective for a variety of species. Accordingly, a wide variety of stakeholders \(including the European Union, Environment Agency, and Natural England\) have altered their policies to improve river connectivity for a wider range of fish species, emphasising natural connectivity restoration methods, such as barrier removal, wherever possible.

","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Dr Lucas’ research on spatial ecology of freshwater fishes \(including those that move between the sea and freshwater\) has revealed the importance of migration, dispersal and seasonal movement \(including short\-distance movement among habitats and for recolonization\) in many species beyond those traditionally regarded as migratory species \(R1\). He has developed new methods \(field telemetry techniques, especially passive transponders\) for the study of fish movement and has examined impacts of engineered river infrastructure \(dams, weirs, culverts, hydropower etc.\) on these species \(R1, R2\). His results challenged the conventional view of a very limited number of fish species, such as salmon and eel, being migratory and requiring free movement for ensuring healthy populations and contributing to diverse river ecosystems. Consequently, river connectivity restoration, using methods that support free movement of all native fish species, is now being communicated and instituted globally \(R1, R2\). 

 The international significance of Dr Lucas’ team’s work is underlined by the research of the EU Horizon 2020 research project \(20 partners, 2016\-2020\) “Adaptive Management of Barriers in European Rivers” \(AMBER\) of which Durham is a major partner. Dr Lucas’ AMBER research has contributed towards the first European River Barrier Atlas \(Belletti…..Lucas *et al.*, 2020. “More than one million barriers fragment Europe’s rivers”. *Nature* **588**, 436\-441\). That research has also shown that 97% of the British river network is fragmented by man\-made barriers. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there are over 2 million barriers to fish movement in the United States. In the context of this extensive fragmentation worldwide, Dr Lucas’ team’s research has better evaluated the impacts of barriers to fish migration and dispersal \(R3\-R6\), especially for those structures of small height, that comprise the great majority of river barriers \(Belletti *et al*., 2020\), but that had previously been assumed not to markedly impact fish movement \(R3\). 

 Fish passes \(= fishways\) are commonly built to facilitate free passage past river barriers and Durham research has been at the forefront of developing methods to measure the efficacy of such approaches \(R1\-R6\). Lucas’ methods employ telemetry of tagged fish approaching obstacles, to establish what routes they use to pass the barriers, and the fate of the fish \(R2\-R6\). 

 Dr Lucas’ research has demonstrated that existing, often costly, conventional ‘concrete and steel’ fish passes can be ineffective, including for species of conservation importance \(R5, R6\). The team has shown and emphasized how connectivity restoration by barrier removal and use of “nature\-like” fish passes can be much more effective for restoration of native fish communities than use of conventional fish passes \(R6\). They have helped develop better methods of connectivity restoration for practitioners, including government agencies and Non\-Governmental Organisations \(NGOs; R2\-R6\). Durham research has also shown how low\-flow conditions can exacerbate the impacts of engineered\-river infrastructure, resulting in delayed migration and reduced survival in migrating salmonids \(R4\). This is crucial because in many rivers periods of low flow are becoming more frequent during sensitive life\-cycle stages, as a result of climate change. During low flow, downstream\-migrating fish such as salmon smolts are unable or unwilling to pass over weirs and are exposed to predators for much longer, impacting wild populations \(R4\). 

####  Evidence of research quality in terms of originality, significance and rigour 

 The underpinning research has been reported in international, influential peer\-reviewed journals \(R2\-R6\), except R1, a 420\-page co\-authored book combining research experience and critical review which, since its publication in 2001, has been cited in 1194 articles \(Google Scholar, July 2020\). R1 was reviewed after publication by Prof. G. Rose for the journal “ *Fish & Fisheries*” \(2002, vol 3, pp. 360\-361\) and he concluded *“The inclusion of applied aspects of migration, and how these are impacted by human use of freshwater systems, makes a fitting end and raison d’être for the book. Many know about salmon, but few know as much about freshwater fish movements as is contained in this volume. Therein lies its value.”*

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Dr Lucas’ team’s research on fish migration, river barriers, river restoration and fish passage has had a global impact on policy, management measures, river restoration and fish conservation actions as outlined below. 

####  Global shift in recognition of the need for free movement of native freshwater fishes 

 Dr Lucas’ research has demonstrated that many more river fish exhibit migration than previously realised, contributing to a paradigm shift in recognition of the need for enabling free movement of a wider range of native species \(E1\-E4; E1\-E3 cite Lucas\) and mobilization of action to solve the problem \(E4, E5 cite Lucas\). Between August 2013 and July 2020 ecological practitioners from 73 countries and 6 continents, cited R1 nearly 700 times, reflecting the depth and breadth of this translational impact \(E1\) – of these citations, 52% included authors from government \(non\-academic\) environmental / fisheries / conservation agencies or NGOs / consultants directly involved in implementing policy change and conservation / river restoration / fisheries actions. 

####  Contribution to methods and solutions for implementation of Water Framework Directive 

 The EU Water Framework Directive \(WFD\) aims to achieve Good Ecological Status \(GES\) in freshwaters through river basin management cycles \(Cycle 1, 2009\-2015; Cycle 2, 2015\-2021\). The WFD requires free movement of migratory fish, necessitating effective fish passage measures and robust assessment methodology, which Dr Lucas’ research \(R1\-R6\) has promoted, shaping ongoing policy and best practice by environmental and nature regulatory agencies and NGOs \(see E2, E4, E6 with citations to Durham research\). However, in 2012 and 2018 \(monitoring reports for 2009\-2015 and 2015\-2021 WFD cycles\), over 50% and 60% respectively of European surface waters failed to reach GES \(E7a,b\). “Hydromorphological modification” which includes dams, weirs, culverts and channelization, was the most common reason for failure to reach GES under the WFD \(E7a,b\). Therefore Dr Lucas’ work on the impact of these structures has been, and remains, important for progress by EU states \(including the UK in this regard\) to meet GES \(E2, E4, E5, E6 and citations to Durham work therein\). For example, the objective quantification of barrier impacts and fish pass efficacy by Durham has been used as evidence, and for good practice in adaptive barrier management \(E4, E5, E6\). Since AMBER estimates over a million river barriers in Europe, this is going to be a long and expensive process to reduce the number of rivers failing to meet GES for that reason. 

####  Conventional fish passes can be failures cf. barrier removals and ‘nature\-like’ solutions 

 Durham’s research has directly led to altered policies by UK environmental and conservation agencies in recognising the need to enable river movements by all native fish species, and that some conventional fish pass designs do not work for non\-salmonid fishes \(E4, E8, E9a\). For a 2\-m high weir, a conventional fish pass from design inception to completion costs GBP200,000\-400,000, while fish passes on large dams cost >GBP1 million, and informal “easements” on streams may cost GBP30,000\-100,000. Thus, it matters that they work. In 2009, the Environment Agency estimated it would cost over GBP500 million to reduce the worst barrier impacts in England and Wales. Lucas’ research has directly shaped UK statutory Agency policy on fish passage by providing evidence on the efficacy of fishway designs and on stream\-connectivity restoration, driving innovation on possible solutions \(E4, E8\). As a result of Durham’s work some conventional fish pass designs are no longer recommended for several species \(E4, E8\), and increasingly, barrier removals or “nature\-like” fish pass designs are adopted \(E4\). The Environment Agency / Natural England have explicitly stated in their WISER \(2017\) policy document \(E9a\) that *“when considering fish pass solutions you should conduct a feasibility study into removing the barrier to fish migration…. we consider barrier removal as best practice”*. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs funded GBP24.5 million of ‘Catchment Restoration Fund’ projects in England to help meet WFD obligations; over the period 2013\-2015, out of 400 fish passage actions, over 160 barriers \(40%\) were removed, 152 nature\-like solutions \(38%\) were applied, 71 eel passes \(18%\)  and just 17 conventional fish passes \(4%\) added \(E9b,c\), reflecting the influence of Lucas’ team’s research on river connectivity restoration \(E4\). 

####  Climate change and fish migration bottlenecks due to low flows at barriers 

 Durham research showing that inhibition of fish passage at small barriers can be compounded by low river flows, which may become more common with climate change, has been adopted by stakeholders and NGOs internationally \(E2, E4, E5, E6 and their citations to Durham work\) and led to changes in UK management plans by environmental and conservation agencies \(E4, E9d\).  Impacts of small barriers on downstream passage by salmonid smolts and the attendant delays and lower survival, concomitant with increased predation exposure as detailed in Durham research \(R4\), have received widespread consideration internationally, leading to policies emphasizing barrier removal and better designed downstream\-movement bypasses  \(E2, E4, E5, E6, E9a, E9d\). 

####  Conservation measures to assist protected fish species 

 Durham research on impacts of river barriers on European river lamprey, and the efficacy of fish passes for them, has been referenced extensively in the 2019 UK Conservation Assessment of this species under Article 17 of the EU Habitats Directive \(E8\). This statutory document identifies the status, major pressures on, and conservation strategy for this species in the UK and contributes to its international conservation. Our research has been used similarly to support best practice for conservation of Atlantic salmon and bullhead in the UK \(E4\). 

####  Community stakeholder engagement 

 Over seven million viewers, including key stakeholders such as naturalists and anglers, were reached through terrestrial television broadcasts in the UK alone \(E10a, b\). These and related media have achieved impact to natural environment stakeholders by illustrating the importance of river connectivity for fish species of conservation concern and why enabling dispersal and movement of the whole fish community at small obstacles is important for the restoration of normal ecological function and food webs in streams.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cairns and Anderson’s pioneering research on distributed cognition in the arts and humanities has enhanced public understanding of the concept of the extended mind, and has influenced curatorial practices in the context of museums and art galleries. 

 In collaboration with National Museums of Scotland and the Talbot Rice Gallery, Cairns and Andersons’ research has: 

-  changed curators’ thinking about the role of galleries and museums in human cognition; 

-  shifted public perceptions of historical artefacts; 

-  engaged new and diverse audiences with the question of distributed cognition and the cognitive benefits of art – including schoolchildren, artists and people affected by homelessness and by economic and educational deprivation. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 Between 2014 and 2018, Cairns and Anderson carried out a series of projects on the history of the ‘extended mind’ and distributed cognition. The notion of distributed cognition had been developed by UoE Philosophers, to denote the ways in which thinking is distributed between the body and the world, with the brain making extensive use of objects and interactions to extend cognitive capacity. Through an extensive body of work, including the £478,000 AHRC\-funded History of Distributed Cognition \(HDC\) project, Anderson and Cairns traced the history of ideas of distributed cognition from Antiquity to the twentieth century. 

 Anderson’s monograph *The Renaissance Extended Mind* showed how ideas and practices of extended cognition were widely evident in another historical period. It examines current notions of the mind as embodied, embedded, enactive and extended; considers their relation to current literary and cultural methodologies; and explores parallels \(and contrasts\) with cognitive practices and ideas about the mind in Renaissance scientific, philosophical, literary and other cultural texts \[3.1\]. 

 Cairns’s work on embodiment, conceptual metaphor theory, and emotion was an integral aspect of HDC research throughout. His 2017 paper compares how two very different dramatisations of the same myth, in Euripides and Seneca, represent the embodied, embedded, social and enactive nature of emotion \[3.2\]. It demonstrates especially how metaphors based on the body and its interactions with the environment convey emotion. A parallel piece shows how Euripides’ *Hippolytus* makes use of a proto\-enactivist model of cognition as an active process based on embodied interaction with and sensorimotor feedback from the environment to dramatise the phenomenology of shame and conscience as socially embedded phenomena \[3.3\]. 

 Anderson and Cairns extended this research through a major collaborative project within HDC, which brought together more than 60 scholars from 13 countries and diverse disciplines. Using guidelines developed by Anderson, they applied contemporary models of distributed cognition from philosophy of mind and cognitive science to historical, cultural and literary works from antiquity to the mid\-twentieth century to demonstrate how these artefacts support and extend our cognitive abilities. Between 2018 and 2020, they published the project’s findings in a four\-volume series entitled The Edinburgh History of Distributed Cognition, providing new insights for philosophy of mind and cognitive science. Key insights further developed through this collaboration included: 

 \- the role of contemporary distributed cognition theory in creating a scientific basis to understand the fundamental significance of culture to humans and the humanities. First developed in Anderson’s book on the Renaissance \[3.1\], these ideas were articulated in the introduction provided for contributing authors by the HDC project’s seminars and workshops \[3.4\]. 

 \- the extent to which/ways in which distributed cognition was explicitly or implicitly evident in Greek and Roman life and thought from the 8<sup>th</sup> century BC to 6<sup>th</sup> century AD. In an introduction that built on his AHRC\-funded and previous research, Cairns elucidated the role and potential of distributed cognition in classical studies \[3.5\]. These ideas were developed through a series of 12 contributions by project collaborators, which were extensively shaped in workshops and written feedback led by Cairns. 

 \- the extensive circulation and distinct expression of ideas and practices of distributed cognition in medieval and Renaissance culture. Building on her earlier work, this approach is articulated in Anderson’s introduction, which examines the contribution of a distributed cognitive methodology to medieval and Renaissance studies \[3.6\]. These ideas were applied in a further series of 16 essays, that were shaped through workshops and written feedback led by Anderson. 

 All the above items underwent thorough peer\-review.

##  4. Details of the impact 

###  Changing curators’ thinking about the role of galleries and museums in human cognition and shifting public perception of historical artefacts 

 In October 2016, the HDC team collaborated with National Museums Scotland \(NMS\) to create a day\-long event at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, based on HDC project research \[3.1 – 3.6\]. Led by Anderson, Cairns, Sprevak and Wheeler, *Thinking with Things* welcomed over 100 people for lectures and discussions on humans’ historical use of objects as mind tools to extend their cognitive abilities \[5.1a\]. The audience were for the most part members of the general public, with attendance skewed more towards a young adult demographic than is usual for the Museum \[5.1a\]. The lectures, along with seminars and blogs, available online on the History of Distributed Cognition website, have received 36,432 visitors by 31 December 2020 \[5.1b\]. 

 In a letter to Cairns in March 2017, the NMS Senior Curator of Science and Principal Curator of Technology noted that the event had led people to look at museums and their societal role in fresh ways: 

 ‘\[It\] raised questions about the nature and role of museums, newly suggesting to audiences that they are the home of tools that scaffold human cognition... The kinds of questions that were posed by audience members after the talks... suggested a shift in understanding of the extent and significance of the role that museums play in... hands\-on enquiries as well as in the preservation of the artefacts... The audience raised questions that showed a change to prior assumptions about interactions with devices that may seem intuitive, such as mobile phones nowadays, but where there are often forms of culturally embedded knowledge, that mean such engagements are less straightforward than they might initially appear. The event was a reminder that part of the curators’ role is to ensure they communicate such tacit knowledge as far as possible’ \[5.1c\]. 

 The success of *Thinking with Things* led the National Museum of Scotland to invite Cairns and Anderson to develop workshops for school pupils, exploring how humans have always used objects to think. Between March and May 2017, HDC project scholars hosted four workshops at NMS for more than 90 pupils aged 10 to 11 from primary schools in Fife, near Edinburgh. The children worked in groups to study objects from the Museum’s collection, such as coins, chainmail and a tablet and stylus, and considered how they could be used to extend people’s minds or bodies. Including games, a science and technology quiz, and a creative drawing exercise which encouraged the pupils to design a mind tool, the workshops were an opportunity for many of the children to visit the Museum for the first time. 

 In post\-session questionnaires, pupils remarked that they learned ‘there are many different ways of thinking, and tools can extend that’ \[5.2, p.37\], ‘even \[…\] your hands can extend your mind’ \[5.2, p.47\], and ‘how much technology affects our learning’ \[5.2, p.49\]. Cairns and Anderson designed the events to align with the Curriculum for Excellence \(Scotland’s national curriculum\) to ensure the transfer of learning back to the classroom. Teachers reported that their involvement changed their perspective and made them think ‘of the technology shown as aids to extend our thinking’ \[5.2, p.27\], and ‘how the word ‘technology’ encompasses much more than we generally think it does’ \[5.2, p.28\]. 

###  Engaging new and diverse audiences with the cognitive benefits of art 

 In 2019, Anderson and Cairns secured AHRC Follow\-on funding to build on the engagement and impact of the HDC project’s research \[3.1 – 3.6\] via contemporary art. In partnership with one of Scotland’s leading visual art galleries, Talbot Rice Gallery \(TRG\), and 13 leading international artists \(from, amongst other places, Austria, Greece, Poland, Northern Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States\), they developed a contemporary art exhibition to present the idea of distributed cognition. *The Extended Mind* employed diverse mediums, including sculptures, video installations and performances, to explore how cognition is not brain\-bound but instead extends across brain, body, and world, offering new ways of understanding the creation and experience of different art styles \[5.3\]. Tokyo\-based mixed\-media artist and winner of the prestigious Shiseido award 2010, Goro Murayama’s work was a particularly strong example of this, showing artist and artwork developing in tandem. 3,839 people attended the exhibition between 2 November 2019 and 1 February 2020 \[5.4a\]. It also received broad media coverage including *Art Review*, *The Times* \(‘mind\-blowing’\) and *Studio International* \(‘fascinating and revelatory’; ‘the complexity and beauty of everyday cognitive processes is revealed mesmerisingly… quite sublime’; ‘an experimental and exciting endeavour, this show succeeds brilliantly’\) \[5.4b\-d\]. 

 The TRG‘s Curator noted that *The Extended Mind* was the first exhibition based on academic research to which it had ever committed and ‘the first exhibition to result in the Talbot Rice Gallery receiving significant funding from an academic research funder’ \(AHRC\). The research collaboration ‘shaped all the major facets \[of the exhibition\], including \[curatorial\] decision making \(with Miranda Anderson named as a third curator\), approaches to communications \(from volunteer inductions to exhibition guides\) and a vibrant widening participation programme’ \[5.4a\]. 

 Anderson, Cairns, Sprevak and Wheeler also created 8 podcasts based on their research \[3.1 \- 3.6\] for the exhibition’s Round Room – the first time that the TRG had made use of audio material in this way. These podcasts have been made available on the Talbot Rice Gallery website. In a survey of 149 attendees, 80% said they had learned something from the exhibition about the extended mind. It offered ‘a perspective on cognition that I haven’t seen before’, said one. It ‘made me think about how thoughts may be represented in ways other than traditional art, writing, numbers’, commented another \[5.5, pp.16 &19\]. Close to half of survey respondents \(47%\) said the experience had changed the way they thought about the mind \[5.5, p.15\]. 

 *The Extended Mind* engaged new and diverse groups of people. During the exhibition, Anderson, Sprevak and TRG staff hosted three workshops with eight and nine\-year\-old pupils from Edinburgh’s Royal Mile Primary School. This included four activities based on the exhibition’s artworks and a presentation by the pupils, exploring the theme of how we can extend our mind, for example through the body, writing and drawing. In post\-event questionnaires it became clear that pupils had begun to appreciate how, in everyday life, they use their bodies and the external world to think. One cited ‘art and singing’ as examples of this. Others mentioned their hands, their use of pencils, beds and toilets; listening to music; even something as apparently simple as ‘sitting down’. The children’s’ teacher noted that the experience inspired her to be ‘more cross\-curricular \[concerning\] all the expressive arts’ \[5.6, p.11\]. 

 In partnership with TRG and the charity Crisis, Anderson and Cairns provided dedicated sessions for people affected by homelessness. They welcomed a group from Ragged University, which supports free peer\-led learning in communities whose socio\-economic circumstances make traditional education inaccessible. One attendee of the Crisis event commented that the workshops had helped her ‘to see behind the artwork to the Artist’s ideas, and also to consider the process of their production’ \[5.7\]. A survey respondent from the Ragged University group commented: ‘Have been interested in debates about supra\-individualism in philosophy... but have never met the ideas materialised by artists. Very life\-enhancing\!’ Another said: ‘My mind and brain are racing, and this will take a long time to process\!... Excellent, thank you\!’ \[5.8a, pp. 5 & 8\]. In a February 2020 letter, the Ragged University Coordinator wrote that the exhibition had helped him to ‘think how I can search out elements of \[university\] education...in the…civic landscape’. It had ‘inspired a sense of belonging and affection, which is much needed to deepen \[broader public\] ownership of the intellectual realm’ \[5.8b\]. 

 *The Extended Mind* led to a new partnership with Queen Margaret University’s MSc Art Psychotherapy programme, through a workshop led by Anderson that was intended to give art therapy students fresh philosophical and neuroscientific angles on their work. Post\-session feedback confirmed the fulfilment of this ambition. One student had been persuaded to reconsider ‘the potential impact of artworks for a client group beyond aesthetics’; a second to reflect on how ‘interventions inside galleries…could help children and adults get more engaged with art’. Two more said that they had become aware, respectively, of the body ‘having a memory of its own and knowing what it wants to do or say before the mind does’, and of ‘know\[ing\] things before you are able to verbalize them’. Another student commented that she had ‘never considered movements forming part of thinking before’. Finally, a number of respondents said that their understanding of the client\-counsellor relationship had been changed \[5.9\]. The reconceptualization of physical environments as having cognitive dimensions appeared to carry ethical implications for how clients are invited into the space in which the encounter with the counsellor takes place. In the words of one art therapy student: 

 ‘It has made me consider the difference and cross\-overs between intervention and invitation – the control a therapist has over a therapeutic environment and the ways in which this control/autonomy can be handed back to the client’ *.* \[5.9, p.11\] 

 Artists involved in the exhibition testified to the benefits they had received. Goro Murayama commented that where he had previously struggled to find ways of exhibiting his work – which stands at the intersection of science, philosophy and art – alongside other artists via a single shared curatorial theme, *The Extended Mind* had enabled him to do just this. It had also given him a model for creating the drawing workshops for autistic children which he had long hoped to establish \[5.10a\]. Marcus Coates \(winner Merrill Lynch Award 2013; Venice Biennale 2007\) concluded that the ‘exhibition, the underlying research, and the conversations around the theoretical ideas with the academic team, opened up a whole new world for me, and \[…\] will influence how I will think in the future about the creative mind and my own artistic practice’ \[5.10b\]. 

 The TRG Curator found significant benefits for the gallery itself from the project. He personally found that his work on subsequent exhibitions had been enhanced by a new understanding of how ‘artworks don’t simply come from an artist’s brain, but have to be worked out through time, via concrete media and through the body... \[the\] research behind distributed cognition validates and articulates this way of working, not as an artistic exception, but as a human necessity.’ More broadly, the TRG was now becoming involved in creating ‘more substantial children’s workshops and supporting materials...\[with\] quantifiable outreach outcomes... build\[ing\] the Curriculum for Excellence… into its thinking around work with its key community partners’ \[5.4a\].

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Older workers are encouraged to extend their working lives beyond traditional retirement ages, yet they experience labour market disadvantage in recruitment, retention and retraining. Loretto and colleagues have generated novel research insights into employment barriers faced by older workers. These insights have: 

-  **Directly informed the development of Scottish Government policies** to improve older workers’ labour market position \(Workplace Equality Fund, Older People’s Framework, Gender Pay Gap Action Plan\). 

-  **Underpinned development of Age Scotland’s **Age Inclusive Matrix** \(AIM**\), an innovative ‘age\-inclusion’ HR consultancy service. Through participation in AIM, organisations across Scotland have implemented policies and practices to support older workers. 

-  **Raised the profile of age inclusion in the diversity agenda of Scottish employers,** via the Age@Work Employers’ Network, and through influencing the agenda of Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development Scotland \(CIPD\) and Business in the Community Scotland \(BITC\), two strategically significant professional organisations.

 2. Underpinning research 

 Concern about the economic implications of the UK’s ageing population has prompted successive governments to encourage the extension of working life beyond traditional retirement ages \(EWL policies\). Legislation has raised State Pension age, abolished mandatory retirement age, and outlawed age\-related workplace discrimination. However, older workers still face age\-related barriers to labour market participation, particularly in terms of recruitment, retention, and retraining. In Scotland, 1 in 3 workers are aged 50\+, yet in 2019 the Scottish employment rate for 50\-64 year olds was only 69.6%, compared to 80% for adults aged 25\-49. Most Scottish employers lack policies and practices to support older workers. The demographic reality of Scotland’s ageing workforce, alongside older workers’ continued labour market disadvantage, stimulated the development of Professor Wendy Loretto’s research agenda in this area. 

 Between 2003 and 2019, Professor Loretto and colleagues conducted a series of landmark studies that explored the implications of EWL policies for employers and for older workers. This influential research has generated nuanced insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with an ageing workforce. 

 Four grant\-funded studies underpin impact; two Scottish projects, and two UK\-wide: 

-  2003\-2004: ‘Older workers in the Scottish labour market’ \(Loretto, W & White, P; Scottish Enterprise; GBP35,805\) 

-  2006\-2007: ‘Encouraging labour  market activity among 60\-64 year olds’ \(Vickerstaff, S. University of Kent, and Loretto, W;  Department for Work & Pensions; GBP106,610\) 

-  2014\-2016: ‘Extending working lives’\(Vickerstaff, S. Loretto, W. & 7 other Co\-Is; ESRC/MRC; GBP571,960\) 

-  2016: ‘Older People & Employment in Scotland’ Loretto, W. & Airey, L.; Scottish Government; GBP26,460\) 

 A key contribution of the research has been to reveal how older workers’ employment experiences are shaped by complex interactions between individual domestic circumstances, employer policies and practices, cultural perceptions of older workers, and wider structural conditions such as the welfare state \(3.1\- 3.6\). Barriers to employment arising in one of these domains may be mitigated or reinforced by conditions in the other domains \(3.6\). Many older workers face multiple intersecting barriers to employment: health problems \(3.2, 3.4, 3.6\), unpaid caring responsibilities \(which disproportionally impact women due to gendered social roles\) \(3.2, 3.3\); lack of job flexibility \(3.3, 3.4, 3.5\); reduced opportunities for training and skills development \(3.1, 3.5\); employers’ ageist attitudes regarding recruitment \(3.1, 3.4\), and a lack of tailored support for older job\-seekers \(3.4\). 

 The research also demonstrates that EWL policies pose challenges for employers. Employers have retreated from the management of older workers, fearing accusations of ageism \(3.4, 3.5\). This ‘silencing’ of conversation around later life employment means that there is often inadequate communication between employers and employees about: 

-  **Later\-life career progression:** older workers may miss out on opportunities for skills development and training \(3.4, 3.5\). 

-  **Flexible work arrangements:** although employers often report that they offer flexible work options to all staff, many older workers are unaware of their right to request such arrangements \(3.4\). 

-  **Retirement planning:** employers rarely initiate conversations about retirement timing, undermining their ability to undertake effective workforce planning \(3.5\). Few employers provide workplace support for retirement planning. Consequently, employees may be unprepared for crucial aspects of retirement, such as pension income \(3.2, 3 *.*4, 3.6\). 

 In 2016, on the basis of Loretto’s highly\-regarded work and expertise in this area, the Scottish Government commissioned Loretto and Airey to undertake an in\-depth qualitative investigation of older people and employment in Scotland \(3.4\), with a particular focus on devising specific policy and practice recommendations to the Scottish Government and to employers. Research evidence from this study confirmed Loretto and colleagues’ previous research findings regarding the multiple barriers to older people’s employment.

 4. Details of the impact 

 In August 2017, Loretto & Airey launched the Scottish Government\-funded research \(3.4\), disseminating findings to a wide range of stakeholders in the public, private and third sectors. Uptake and use of the findings and recommendations has led to new Scottish Government policy initiatives and improved employer policies and practices to support older workers. This research has: 

 Informed the development of Scottish Government policies to support older workers 

 Research evidence from ‘Older People and Employment in Scotland’ \(3.4\) has been widely used within Scottish Government to inform policy development across multiple overlapping policy arenas such as labour market diversity and inclusion, transport and care \[5.1, 5.11\]. It has served as a reference source for Ministerial briefings and prepared answers to Parliamentary Questions, and has been cited in Ministerial speeches and correspondence \[5.1, 5.11\]. The research directly underpinned the development of the following Scottish Government initiatives designed to tackle the labour market challenges faced by older workers \[5.1\]: 

  

1.  **Workplace Equality Fund \(WEF\)** \[5.2\] **.** WEF funds business\-led projects to improve labour market participation of marginalised groups. Research findings highlighting employment barriers faced by older workers led to their inclusion as one of the 4 target groups for support \[5.1; 5.3 p50\]. Worth GBP800,000 in 2019, WEF has supported eight ‘older worker’ projects, undertaken by employers in a diverse range of sectors, including construction, STEM, finance, law, hospitality, furnishings, and charitable organisations. 

1.  **A Fairer Scotland for Older People: A Framework for Action \(2019\)** \[5.3\] **.** This document defines the Scottish Government’s key policy priorities for multi\-stakeholder action to deliver better outcomes for older people. It incorporates Loretto & Airey’s recommendations, e.g. “increasing older people’s awareness of flexible working opportunities and the right to request flexible working” \(p50\) and “improving recognition that women still carry out most caring responsibilities’ \(p50\), in order to ‘promote age\-inclusive working practices amongst Scottish employers” \[5.1\]. 

1.  **A Fairer Scotland for Women: Gender Pay Gap Action Plan \(2019\)** \[5.4\] **.** Scottish Government introduced a GBP5,000,000, 3\-year ‘Women Returners Programme’ to support older women to stay in or return to work after a career break \[5.1; 5.4, p25\]. This was a direct consequence of the research finding that older women face multiple challenges in the labour market, such as combined ageism and sexism, and the negative impact of lifecourse caring responsibilities upon employment opportunities \[5.1\]. 

 Improved Scottish employers’ policies and practices via Age Scotland’s ‘Age Inclusive Matrix’ 

 Age Scotland is Scotland’s leading charity representing older people. A core programme of its work is to improve older workers’ employment experiences through promoting age\-inclusive workplaces. The research underpinned the development of its *Age Inclusive Matrix* \(AIM\) \[5.5, 5.11\]. This pioneering specialist HR consultancy service, launched in 2018, assists employers to evaluate existing management policies and practices, and implement age\-inclusive strategies. The following ‘best practice’ recommendations from the research were integrated into AIM: 

-  provision of and effective communication of flexible work opportunities, 

-  unconscious bias training on age, 

-  age\-related workforce planning, 

-  career development strategies for older workers, 

-  regular reviews with employees regarding later\-life working \[5.5\]. 

 In 2019, after piloting AIM in four organisations, Age Scotland was awarded GBP270,000 by the National Lottery Community Fund to expand AIM into a further 29 medium/large organisations across a range of industries. By December 2020, 9 organisations had completed AIM and had implemented various combinations of the following policy and practice changes \[5.5, 5.6, 5.10\]: 

-  introduction of new pre\-retirement workshops for employees to help them plan for their futures 

-  re\-launch of updated flexible working policy, communicated to employees of all ages 

-  new health and wellbeing programmes aimed specifically at older workers, to improve their functional fitness, flexibility and to reduce sedentary behaviours 

-  carer networks established to support older workers with caring responsibilities 

-  introduction of Unconscious Bias training for senior managers, focusing on age 

-  age\-awareness training for line managers, to develop their skills in managing older workers 

-  creation of new datasets to capture and monitor age\-related staff data, to support workforce planning 

-  development of online management resource entitled ‘Managing an Ageing Workforce’ 

-  launch of menopause awareness programme 

-  launch of apprentice scheme 

-  integration of ‘age’ into anti\-bullying policy 

 Implementation of age\-inclusive policies and practices has led to benefits for older workers in participating organisations. For example, TAQA updated its flexible working policy to: i\) introduce flexible retirement, which has increased productivity among older employees; and ii\)  reduce the intensity of offshore shift patterns, which has led to a decrease in reports of tiredness from the older workforce \[5.10\]. 

 Raised the profile of age inclusion in the diversity agenda of Scottish employers 

 In 2017, Loretto & Airey identified Age Scotland, Business in the Community Scotland \(BITC\), and Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development Scotland \(CIPD Scotland \- approximately 11,000 members\) as strategically significant beneficiaries of the research, given the scope of these organisations’ remit with employers in Scotland. Relationships established with these organisations have extended the reach of research impact among Scottish employers \[5.11\], whilst also amplifying the activities of the partners themselves – as evidenced by the following comments: 

 “The evidence and recommendations presented in the research report have contributed to the development of a much stronger focus on older workers in all 

 areas of CIPD Scotland policy and insight” 

 \(Head of CIPD Scotland and NI \[5.7; see also 5.11\]\). 

 “The timely research conducted by Professor Loretto and Dr Airey, and the subsequent collaborative relationships they have fostered with BITC Scotland and other partner organisations, have strengthened and stimulated BITC Scotland’s work on age\-inclusive workplaces.” 

 \(Operations Manager for Scotland, North East and North West England, BITC \[5.8\]\) 

 With these partners, Loretto and Airey organised ‘Time to Act’, a conference for 60 people \(senior business leaders\) in September 2018, at which the Scottish Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, Jamie Hepburn MSP, endorsed the research findings. Audience polling indicated that, for 85% of voters, the event had increased their knowledge of how to improve age\-inclusivity in their organisation \[5.9\]. 

 In 2020, the partnership evolved into the Age@Work Employers’ Network. This network meets quarterly to provide on\-going support to a group of leading employers in Scotland \(n=16\), helping them implement age\-inclusive policies and practices: 

 “The activities of this network have already served to raise the profile of ‘age’ as an equally important element of diversity and inclusion within Scotland”

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Pike’s research on the ethics of doping has had a demonstrable impact on the world of sport. His work has influenced the World Anti\-Doping Agency \(WADA\) to tighten its regulations on the use of Therapeutic Use Exemptions \(TUEs\), which allow athletes to use otherwise prohibited methods or substances on medical grounds. The revised WADA code was unanimously approved on 7 November 2019 in Katowice, Poland. 

 Pike has also shaped ethical policy approaches to transgender inclusion in sex\-segregated sport. His research was influential in developing World Rugby’s controversial Transgender Guideline which recommend the exclusion of transwomen from women’s Rugby Union, on considerations of safety and fairness. This policy was adopted by World Rugby on 9<sup>th</sup> October 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Pike is a leader in the field of the ethics of sport, and Chair of the British Association for the Philosophy of Sport. Since 2016, his work has focused on the nature of sport, ethical dimensions of performance enhancement, and transgender people’s participation in competitive sport. 

  

 His primary research presents the first thorough, ethical analysis of Therapeutic Use Exemption \(TUE\) regulations **\[O1 \- O4\]**. These exemptions allow athletes to use otherwise prohibited methods and substances, such as performance\-enhancing drugs if that use is therapeutic. TUEs’ use is controversial. British competitive cyclist Bradley Wiggins’ use of a corticosteroid asthma treatment during his preparations for the 2012 Tour de France, for example, attracted criticism from the media, sports leaders and the UK parliament, with many suggesting it had unfairly enhanced his performance. 

 Pike’s research shows that the World Anti\-Doping Agency’s \(WADA\) 2016 regulations overlooked professional athletes’ and coaches’ intentions in applying for TUEs for medical treatments. Justifying TUEs against critics, Pike argues that the regulations should look at these intentions, as well as substances’ potential impact on performance, and assess their permissibility with reference to the Doctrine of Double Effect. 

 Pike's ethical analysis of TUEs stems from his essentialist theory of sport **\[O2, O3\]** which develops a ‘non\-conventional’ account of doping. From this perspective, he argues 'doping' is not merely a transgression of arbitrary rules, but constitutes a fundamental change to the nature 

 of a sport, in the same way as using a hidden motor in a bicycle race **\[O2\]**. With Cordell, Pike argues for the standard characterisation of Lance Armstrong as a cheat, against the view that “ *it’s not cheating if they all do it*” **\[O4\]**. He argues that sport is much more than “ *just a bunch of rules*” \(Savulescu\), and it is possible to systematically address challenges to the integrity of sport, such as mechanical doping, transhumanist approaches to enhancement, and transgender inclusion according to gender identity, in sex\-segregated sport **\[O2, O3, O5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Influencing WADA to change its rules on TUEs** 

 In November 2017, WADA embarked on a comprehensive review of its Word Anti\-Doping Code \(WADC\) and invited Pike to contribute research insights to enhance its International Standard for TUEs \(ISTUE\), based on his 2017 paper **\[O1\]**. At the same time, the UK’s national anti\-doping organisation, UK Anti\-Doping \(UKAD\) asked him to consult on its submission to the WADA review. 

 In July 2018, Pike welcomed fourteen experts from the world of sport and academia for a private one\-day symposium at The Royal Society of Medicine in London, to discuss improvements to the TUE system. The event was attended by representatives of WADA and UKAD, the Union Cycliste Internationale \(UCI\) and the International Paralympic Committee \(IPC\). Pike used his research to argue for the reordering of the regulations and clarification of the logical relationships between them **\[C1\]**. In December 2018, WADA published a draft of its revised ISTUE for consultation. In February \- May 2018 Pike responded to this consultation with detailed recommended changes to the revisions, based on his research **\[O1 \- O4, C2\]**. Pike also used his research to guide UKAD’s February 2019 submission to the review process, which endorsed his arguments regarding the order and logical relationships between the regulations. In its evidence, UKAD called for WADA to “ *\[...\] commission a global research study to investigate the intentions \(capability, opportunity, and motives\) of athletes, doctors, and coaches regarding the TUE system*” **\[C1\]**. 

 In November 2019, WADA announced changes to its WADC, including a revised ISTUE, at its World Conference in Poland. The new code came into force on 1<sup>st</sup> January 2021. The headline change to the TUE Regulations is that “ *Article 4 \(obtaining a TUE\) \[has been\] restructured and clarified*”. The influence of Pike’s research on intentions is evident in four critical changes to the regulations: 

1.  The new WADC reorders regulations and clarifies logical relations between them. Pike’s argument, which was endorsed by UKAD, was crucial to this change. 

1.  Athletes will now only be granted TUEs for ‘diagnosed’ medical complaints if they can provide relevant clinical evidence. 

1.  TUEs can only be granted when therapeutic use of a prohibited substance or method will not, ‘produce any additional enhancement of performance beyond what might be anticipated by a return to the Athlete’s normal state of health following the treatment of the medical condition.’ This is the change necessary to make it unlikely that Bradley Wiggins would have received a TUE in 2012. 

1.  The new code includes ‘expanded discretion to grant retroactive TUEs’, to athletes who can prove they required an emergency medical intervention using a prohibited substance or method which did not allow them time to apply for a TUE **\[C4\]**. 

 In a 3<sup>rd</sup> January 2020 email, the Head of Science and Medicine at WADA, acknowledged “ *the important contributions*” of Pike’s work to the review process. He also welcomed Pike’s “ *specific and detailed reviews on numerous iterations of the draft ISTUE 2021*”, which “ *included valuable requests and suggestions for clarity on the key 4.1 \- 4.3 articles and the need for specific diagnoses*” **\[C4\]**. 

 In a 15<sup>th</sup> June letter, the Head of Science and Medicine at UKAD wrote that Pike’s input “ *assisted UKAD in presenting well\-informed arguments from an ethical perspective to WADA”.* He also confirmed “ *the 2021 version of the ISTUE contains revisions that have been guided by Dr Pike’s research on the ethics of TUEs*” **\[C4\]**. 

 **Shaping ethical policy approaches to transgender participation in sex\-based categories of sport** 

 Based on Pike’s expertise in sport ethics, the governing body of Rugby Union, World Rugby, invited him to be the only expert witness on ethics at its February 2020 workshop on transgender sport in London **\[C5\]**. The two\-day event brought together more than 30 experts from the fields of performance science, medicine, risk, law and social sciences to discuss the issue. Drawing on his work, Pike argued for a decision tree or ‘lexical priority’ approach to the question of transgender participation. This approach prioritises the duty to minimise essential risk rather than an over\-simple ‘balancing’ approach. Pike’s evidence provided a philosophical context to two critical pieces of scientific evidence presented at the event. The first study found female rugby players are at 20\-30% higher risk of injury playing alongside transgender women, whose birth sex predisposes them to be physically stronger and faster. The second suggested transgender women who undergo hormone treatment retain male sporting advantage due to androgenisation \(male puberty\). Pike argued that considerations of safety, then fairness, should come first and second in the decision\-making process, above consideration of inclusion into the women’s game **\[C5\]**. 

 After reviewing his evidence, later published, World Rugby concluded that: 

 “*\[…\] safety and fairness cannot presently be assured for women competing against transwomen in contact rugby \[…\]. As a result of this process and based on the available evidence, it was concluded that a balance between safety, fairness and inclusion could not be provided for transwomen playing women’s contact rugby*” **\[C6\]**. 

 On 9th October 2020, World Rugby published guidelines which excluded trans women from those women’s rugby competitions that it directly organises. The guidelines represent the first clear break with popular identity\-based arguments for transgender participation in sex\-segregated sport **\[C6\]**. In a letter dated 21st December January 2020 Professor Ross Tucker, research consultant to World Rugby wrote “ *Pike presented a compelling case that was ultimately influential in how the World Rugby working group weighed the various arguments. In particular, he introduced a concept of lexical ordering, and contrasted two approaches, one where various values must be balanced, and another where they should be prioritized by a sporting organization in order to arrive at a decision*” **\[C7\]**. He adds:

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Fraud and corruption are a persistent global threat to development and democracy. Whilst whistleblowing is the most effective means of detection, retaliation that many whistleblowers suffer, has an inhibitory effect on others.  Therefore better whistleblower protection is likely to offer more effective detection and prevention of such crimes.  Dr Vandekerckhove’s conceptualisation and empirical validation of the **three\-tiered whistleblower model \(internal to an organisation, to a regulator, in the public sphere\)**, a more protracted process than previously considered, has meant that **protection policy and legislation now cover the full extent of whistleblower behaviours most often needed to expose fraud and corruption**. 

 The research, and three\-tiered model, has transformed whistleblower protections for the following: **\(1\)** **The 47 member states of the Council of Europe**, through improving coverage of protections to all three tiers in the Council of Europe Recommendation on Whistleblower Protection \(CM/Rec\(2014\)7\), 2014;  **\(2\)** **The 27 member states of the EU**, through improving coverage of whistleblower protections to all three tiers in EU Directive \(EU2019/1937\), 2019;  **\(3\)** **The** **Netherlands and Kosovo**, through improving institutional and legislative reforms for whistleblower protection, 2018.* 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Whistleblowing is one of the most important means to detect wrongdoing. Across regions, the average percentage of fraud uncovered by whistleblowers, across countries and across sectors is 41% \(Kroll, 2016, Global Fraud Report, New York: Kroll\). **This makes whistleblowing more effective than standard audit processes for uncovering wrongdoing \(31%**\)**. In the US, 48% of cases where fraud was uncovered were facilitated by employees making whistleblower disclosures. In the Gulf region that was only 20%. The authors of the Kroll report attribute this difference in anti\-fraud effectiveness to *a lack of internal whistleblowing systems and a lack of federal laws providing adequate protection* in the Gulf region, in stark contrast to the US. *Thus, legislation that 1\) obliges organisations to have internal whistleblowing arrangements, and 2\) that protects whistleblowers when they escalate concerns to a regulator, or 3\) the media, improves the ability at all levels of society to detect and deter fraud and corruption. Dr **Vandekerckhove**’s three\-tiered model has made this possible.* 

 Popular notions of whistleblowing assume this is a one\-off decision. However, the research led by **Vandekerckhove** shows that whistleblowing is more likely to be a **protracted process** during which people make successive attempts to raise a concern about workplace wrongdoing. His research has shaped whistleblower protection legislation. He is the sole researcher proposing the **three\-tiered model**, a model that has been adopted in EU level policy that requires all EU member states to change national legislation.  Based on conceptual work as part of his PhD in 2006, but further developed whilst working as senior lecturer at the university from January 2010, **Vandekerckhove** developed a prescriptive model for **whistleblowing at** **three tiers \(internal to an organisational recipient, to a regulator, and to the wider public\)**.  He used this model to empirically make comparative evaluative studies of national whistleblowing frameworks \[ **3.1**\]. The research found that *1\) in none of the EU countries did legislation oblige private sector organisations to have internal whistleblowing arrangements; 2\) protection at second tier \(to a regulator\) was also very limited \(Belgium for public sector, France for corruption, Ireland for both public and private sector\); 3\) except for the UK and Romania, none of the EU countries provided protection at the third tier \(whistleblowing to the media\).* 

 In 2013 **Vandekerckhove** led a collaborative project between the university and Public Concern at Work \(one of the leading civil society organisations providing advice to whistleblowers, renamed Protect in Sep 2018\). This research consisted of an empirical study of 1,000 whistleblowing helpline case studies in the UK. Through this research, **Vandekerckhove** provided evidence of the **protracted nature of actual whistleblowing, i.e. that whistleblowing starts internally and may remain so, but if unsuccessful, it leads to further escalation to a regulatory agency, and possibly further to the media**.** The research also provides insight into *what determines the choice of internal channel to raise a concern*, as well as *how organisations tend to respond to internal and external whistleblowing*. An initial output from this research was published in 2013 in the form of an open access lay report \[ **3.2**\], followed by a later academic article published in a leading peer reviewed journal, using the same data and covering the same ground \[ **3.3**\]. 

 **Vandekerckhove**’s further research using this three\-tiered model relates to *how transparency can be enhanced through the publishing of aggregated data from whistleblowing channels* \[ **3.4**\]. This research supports the recommendation that *organisations should develop and implement policies and systems for internal whistleblowing*. **Vandekerckhove** \(Co\-PI with Loyens, Utrecht University\) has also undertaken commissioned research on institutional arrangements for the Dutch Whistleblower Authority in the Netherlands \[ **3.5, 3.6**\]. 

 Hence, **Vandekerckhove**’s body of research consists of **both conceptual and empirical work that supports policies and protection for whistleblowing at three tiers: internal \(whistleblowing within the organization\), external \(whistleblowing to a regulator\), and public \(whistleblowing to the media\).** **Vandekerckhove** is the sole researcher with an explicit articulation of this three\-tiered model for whistleblowing.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Fraud and corruption are a persistent global threat to development and democracy. Global fraud surveys show *whistleblowing is the most effective way to detect fraud*, more effective than any standard audit process for uncovering wrongdoing.  The retaliation many whistleblowers suffer, however, has an inhibitory effect on others who could report wrongdoing but remain silent out of fear. Recognition that *strengthening whistleblower protection* could lead to more effective deterrence and detection of crime is demonstrated in the impacts below.  Dr **Vandekerckhove**’s research, specifically the three\-tiered model, has resulted in these impacts on whistleblower policy and legislation, and thereby to the **efforts in Europe to counter fraud and corruption**.** 

1.  <ins> **The three\-tiered model: enhancing</ins> <ins>whistleblower</ins> <ins>protection in the Council of Europe Recommendation on</ins> <ins>Whistleblower</ins> <ins>Protection to the 47 member states**</ins> 

 The *Council of Europe \(COE\) has 47 member states, including EU27, Turkey, Ukraine, Russia, and even the UK post\-Brexit* \(not be confused with the EU Council\). The COE is an international organisation whose stated aim is to uphold human rights, democracy and rule of law in Europe. COE Recommendations are not legally binding on its member states but provide international benchmark guidance for national policy.  In May 2013, **Vandekerckhove** was part of an expert panel invited by COE to discuss a draft of what would become the *COE Recommendation on Whistleblower Protection*. It was here that his research on whistleblowing as a protracted process and his articulation of the three\-tiered approach started its route to impact \[ **5.1**\]. 

 *In September 2014 the COE Committee of Ministers approved and published its **Recommendation on Whistleblower Protection \- CM/Rec\(2014\)7. The Recommendation adopts the three\-tiered model as one of its principles \(i.e. Principle 14\)** \[ **5.1**\] and further explicitly references **Vandekerckhove**’s research in the explanatory memorandum to underpin the claim that **whistleblowing is a protracted process and therefor requires a three\-tiered approach** \[ **5.2**\]. By doing so, the recommendation acknowledges the need for whistle\-blowers to be protected at each stage of the protracted process they often go through in exposing corruption.* 

1.  <ins> **The three\-tiered model: Incorporation into EU Law via EU Directive to the 27 member states,</ins> <ins>thereby</ins> <ins>strengthening</ins> <ins>whistleblower</ins> <ins>protection and attendant</ins> <ins>protection against corruption and fraud**</ins> 

 In November 2016 **Vandekerckhove** chaired the panel on whistleblowing at the DG Justice Annual Symposium on Fundamental Human Rights \[ **5.3**\], where the *European Commission \(EC\)* first committed to investigate an EU Directive on whistleblower protection. June 2017 he was invited by *DG Justice* as an expert to feedback on a draft of the impact study the EC was preparing for such a directive.  *The next month, the EC’s Directorate General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs \(DG GROW\) published a ‘Study on Quantifying the Economic Benefits of Whistleblower Protection in Public Procurement’ making the economic case for legislation to define and protect the rights of whistleblowers in the EU. **The cost\-benefit study used a scenario applying the three\-tiered model as specified in the COE Recommendation, thus explicitly using Vandekerckhove’s model \[ **5.4**\]. In DG GROW’s estimate *the benefits of effective whistleblower protection for the EU are EUR 5.8 to 9.6 billion each year in the area of public procurement alone* \[ **5.4**\]. *Benefits of other models that would not offer protection at all three tiers are lower.* *The study therefore directly links the less tangible benefits of protecting the human rights and wellbeing of whistleblowers themselves, to the associated economic benefit.* 

 In April 2018 the **EC* published the **justification study for an EU Directive proposal on whistleblower protection** \(COM\(2018\)218final; 2018/0106\(COD\) **\). The study makes explicit reference to Vandekerckhove’s research** \[ **5.5**\] *and acknowledged the role of an EU Directive on whistleblower protection as a means to reduce corruption and fraud, whilst improving worker protection at all three whistleblower tiers*. *The number of EU workers that would benefit from improved protection is estimated at 85,022,000 workers* \[ **5.5**\]. The need for protection across all three tiers was emphasised by the fact that since **Vandekerckhove**’s 2010 study \[ **3.1**\], and prior to the EU Directive, only Netherlands and France had made it mandatory for organisations to have an internal whistleblowing policy; only 10 countries of the 27 had comprehensive whistleblowing legislation at 2nd tier \(to a regulator covering both public and private sector\); only 4 countries had provided protection for whistleblowing to the media \(France, Ireland, Italy and Romania\). 

 At this point, the *EC* also launched an **EU Directive proposal**, *which **maps itself explicitly \[5.6\] onto the COE Recommendation, thus using Vandekerckhove’s research to phrase and conceptualise the three\-tiered approach in their proposal**.*  On 15 April 2019, after many committee steps and trilogues between the European Parliament, the EC and the European Council, a final version of the **EU Directive on Protection of Persons Reporting Breaches of Union Law** \(2018/0106\(COD\) – P8\_TA\(2019\)0366\)* was voted\-in by overwhelming majority in the *European Parliament*. During these debates, **Vandekerckhove’s research continued to be relied on, specifically in the discussions on whether the three tiers constitute a mandatory sequence or whether an employee can choose at which tier a concern is raised** \[ **5.7, 5.8**\]. 

 **The Directive \- \(EU\) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 Oct 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law** \- was adopted on this date, published in the Official Journal of the European Union 26 November, and **entered into force on 16 December 2019**. **Member States have until 17 December 2021 to transpose it into their national laws**, which involves as a **minimum standard: mandatory internal policies in organisation of more than 50 employees, extending mandates of regulators to receive and handle whistleblowing reports, and providing protection for whistleblowers at three tiers \(internal, regulator, public\)** \[ **5.9**\]. **Thus, Vandekerckhove’s three\-tiered model has become fully incorporated into EU Law in acknowledgement of the greater protection it offers to whistleblowers themselves, and thereby, the enhanced protection it provides against corruption and fraud in the EU.** * The progress across EU countries to transpose the EU Directive into their own law can be viewed here:  [https://www.polimeter.org/en/euwhistleblowing](https://www.polimeter.org/en/euwhistleblowing).  As can be seen, currently 21 of the 27 EU member states are in progress to complete transposition of the directive by the Dec 2021 due date. *At this point, all 27 countries within the EU will have protections for whistleblowers that incorporate Vandekerckhove’s three\-tiered model built into their own law.* 

1.  <ins> **The three\-tiered model at country level: strengthening whistleblowing protection in the Netherlands and Kosovo via shaping institutional and legislative change**</ins> 

 **The Netherlands:** In preparation for meeting EU Directive requirements the *Dutch Whistleblower Authority* was established as a government agency in 2016.  In 2018 it commissioned **Vandekerckhove** and Loyens \(Utrecht University\) to research institutional implementation of whistleblowing legislation \[ **3.5, 3.6**\]. They used this research, and advice, from **Vandekerckhove** \[ **5.10**\] to *review their strategy, position and mandate to align with the EU Directive.*  Key applications of the three\-tiered model in its **new strategy** are that the **Dutch Whistleblower Authority now perform a watchdog function on internal whistleblowing arrangements, whistleblowing handling processes of regulators, and generally as a centre of expertise that can help whistleblowers to navigate the three tiers and their institutions** \[ **5.10**\]. 

 **Kosovo**: In 2016 **Vandekerckhove** carried out a project commissioned by the *Council of Europe* under Phase II of PECK II \(Project against economic crime in *Kosovo\)*. He used his body of research work **\[3.1\-3.4\]** to write a technical paper reviewing the extant whistleblowing legislation in Kosovo and made recommendations \(ECCD\-PECKII\-TP\-03/2016\) \[ **5.11a**\].  **In 2018, the Kosovo legislation was amended in line with Vandekerckhove’s recommendations** made in the technical reports **\[5.11b, 5.11c, 5.11d\].  **The law was enacted and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Kosovo on 18 December 2018** \[ **5.11e**\].  *The legislation applies to all workers in the private and public sectors of Kosovo meaning **improved worker protection at all three levels of whistleblowing \(internal, to regulator, public\) for 357,095 workers** \[ **5.11f**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted at Buckinghamshire New University \(BNU\) has resulted in the delivery of innovative education services and enhanced student learning and participation in Eastern Europe.  Specifically, this research has led to the development of Entrepreneurship Education programmes tailored to particular needs in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, has led to creating an organisational framework for the involvement of students in EE programmes, and has led to the validation and implementation of the EE programmes in five Eastern European universities.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Entrepreneurship Education \(EE\) at higher education institutions has gained significant importance and has become a global phenomenon. Policy makers regard entrepreneurial Education as a tool to solving complex societal problems. In its attempt to assist Eastern Neighbouring countries with their social and economic development, the EU has funded a plethora of projects aimed at developing the capacity of higher education. BNU has led, alongside other universities and companies from the EU, the development, implementation and testing of EE programmes in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. 

 A plethora of approaches has been used to measure the impact of EE programmes throughout the world. Very few studies have been conducted to assess student’s opinions regarding the relevance of the EE in Eastern Europe. Research led by Dorin Festeu has concluded that students understand the importance of the theory but prefer involvement in real life activities under the guidance of real entrepreneurs. This research has led to structuring the implementation of an EE programme within an EU funded project during 2014\-2015. \[1\] 

 The research that led to the development of a delivery framework of EE programme in Eastern European neighbouring countries constituted the basis for the implementation of a successful €1.3 Mil project within the TEMPUS programme of the European Commission. \[2\] 

 Although there is a strong research base that led to structuring EE programmes in the western world there is very little research to inform the structure and content of such programmes in Eastern Europe. Research led by Dr Dorin Festeu \[2\] has led to the identification of the structure of an EE programme tailored to universities in the region. The research has been used as a theoretical framework for a bid for funding within the TEMPUS programme of the European Commission. 

 The research assessing learners’ opinions on the structure, content and mode of delivery of EE programmes has led to the development of a successful application for funding, €570,000, within the Erasmus Plus programme of the European Commission. 

 Research that underpinned the publication of the articles “Entrepreneurship Education Programme \-students’ opinions” \[1\] and “Entrepreneurship Education programme tailored to Eastern European neighbouring countries” \[2\] was conducted in 2014\-2015 and 2017\-2018 respectively. Dorin Festeu of BNU was the academic coordinator of the Erasmus SUCSID project and led the development of the EE programme. SUCSID project was co\-led by Montpellier University and Buckinghamshire New University represented by Dorin Festeu. Montpellier University was the financial coordinator and BNU was the academic coordinator. Dorin Festeu has designed the data collection method and led the collection and the analysis of the data for the two articles. The co\-authors of the published articles translated the text for participants in Moldavian and Russian and contributed to the identification of country specific literature sources.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Entrepreneurship Education \(EE\)  programme was developed based on the research conducted in Eastern European universities \[2\] and was the central piece that supported the establishment of eight Start\-up Centres in universities in: Belarus National Technical University; The Academy of Economic Science of Moldova; Komrat State University\-Moldova; Kharkiv National University of Civil Engineering and Architecture\-Ukraine; Ternopil National Technical University\-Ukraine; Sumy State University\-Ukraine; Kharkiv National University of Economics\-Ukraine; National University for Municipal Economy in Kharkiv\-Ukraine. \[5.A and 5.D\]. 

 The research \[1\] was disseminated through a series of 52 dissemination events in Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine \[5.D p.1\] and the results supported the validation of an Entrepreneurship Education Masters level programme in five top universities: Belarus National Technical University;  Komrat State University\-Moldova; Kharkiv National University of Civil Engineering and Architecture\-Ukraine; Sumy State University\-Ukraine; National University for Municipal Economy in Kharkiv\-Ukraine. Validation approval documents issued by each of the above mentioned universities are presented in \[5.B\]. The modules that were recommended in the research led by BNU \[2\] were those that were validated. The five universities have validated the EE programme containing the following modules: Innovation management; Entrepreneurship; Start\-up projects business planning; Leadership and start\-up team management and intellectual property law. \[5.B\]. The validated EE programme encourages students to learn how to set\-up and run a business and triggers the enrollment of over 200 students per year, \[5.D\] 

 The establishment of the start\-up centres and the validation of the EE programme has had a positive impact on universities’ ability to deliver learning experiences that helped students meet their educational needs, were relevant to their future career and equipped students with appropriate skills. Evidence to support this claim is reflected in the evaluation conducted with those students who participated in the EE programme \(The EE programme was titled: Innovation Development and Promotion Programme\-\(IDP\). “ *The course has met my educational needs\-to a high level*”\-87% of the 319 participants; “ *The modules were highly relevant*”\-78%; “ *The modules have equipped me with the appropriate skills and knowledge to enhance my practice*.”\-85% \[5.C p.32\-37; p.66; p.93; p.134; p.159; p.184; p.211; p.239\]. 

 The modules, developed to encourage entrepreneurial activities, were delivered outside the classroom offering students the opportunity to experience a ‘learning by doing’ approach which is innovative in these countries where most of the learning is exclusively theoretical \(Bondarchuk et.al., 2019; Pogorevici, 2019\). Research is currently underway to assess the long\-term impact of these programmes on the number of students who do go on to establish their own business. 

 The documents submitted as sources to corroborate the impact were selected from the Final Report submitted to the Executive Agency of the European Commission \(EACEA\). The reports were assessed by EACEA evaluators and the SUCSID project has been rated as “good”. Narrative evaluation was also provided. Quotes from the EACEA evaluation letter \[5.D\] \(p1\) states that: “ *In particular we estimate that the project registered a good achievement level and impact, as confirmed by the field monitoring visits carried out in Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine by the National Erasmus\+ Offices*.” Another quote from the EACEA evaluation letter concludes: “ *Regarding sustainability, we acknowledge that dedicated admin staff has been appointed to support the start\-up centres, and that over 50 institutional partnerships & cooperation agreements have been signed with local and national enterprises. This will certainly contribute to the long\-term sustainability of the centres and will guarantee commercial opportunities for the entrepreneurial ideas of the students. Furthermore, we are pleased to learn that some 200 students have enrolled to the newly\-developed courses and that enterprises are now aware that universities could provide services and could be a credible partner for the training of their staff. Some enterprises even became active members of the start\-up centres. This will also add to the project's long\-lasting impac*t.” \[5.D\]. 

 Obtaining funding that led to the development of the start\-up centres, validation of the EE programme tailored to Eastern European universities and implementation of the EE programme was the direct result of the research led by BNU.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex research has changed the way in which financial risk is managed by central banks and regulators internationally. Using her network model, a systemic risk software application \(App\) was developed by Markose to digitally map the Indian financial system and detect financial instability for the Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\). This App and the Markose network model on the epidemic R number for financial contagion has been adopted by RBI and is used routinely to mitigate risk by monitoring the positions of financial institutions within the interbank market. As academic advisor to the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision \(BCBS\) and Financial Stability Board \(FSB\) for the G20 reforms for over\-the\-counter global derivatives markets, Markose’s research was drawn upon in their Macroeconomic Impact Assessment of over\-the\-counter Derivatives Regulatory Reforms in 2013. Markose followed this with a 10\-year ‘after the financial crisis’ quantitative assessment of the G20 reforms released by Banque de France at the 2017 International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) Spring Meeting. Markose’s research continues to inform regulatory policy debate on managing systemic risk in financial systems. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \[available from HEI on request\] 

 Underpinning research started in the early 2000’s when Professor Markose was Founder Director \(2000\-2009\) of a multi\-disciplinary centre \(Centre for Computational Finance and Economics Agents, CCFEA\) \[G1\]. At CCFEA Markose pioneered big data driven financial network and agent\-based models, along with complexity economics marking a break with mainstream Economics and its tool sets. Markose \[R1, R2\] sets out the necessity for computational models and a complexity approach that mark her highly original paradigm. Markose’s approach highlights the paradigm shift involved in digital systems and of system failure that occurs when uber intelligent agents interact and often at times, in response to regulation, produce novelty/surprises and radical structure changing dynamics. Markose argues that this arms\-race dynamic is missing from mainstream economic models \[R2\]. Econometric models are of little help in surmising potential futures, and hence Markose has embarked on computational simulation models with granular data on economic agent interaction and interconnections. 

 \[R3\] sets out the first large scale agent\-based computational economic model \(ACE\) policy related project, funded by the Foresight Office of Science and Technology that Markose undertook in 2006 when she designed a smart market for congestion. This experience of designing smart markets for negative externalities based on ‘polluter pays principle’ to avoid unsustainable outcomes, has been incorporated in her systemic risk models to design a Pigou tax on those financial institutions that undertook excessive risk taking that can jeopardize entire economies. 

 Markose’s CCFEA research on network analyses to track financial and economic contagion, led to Markose’s appointment as consultant to the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) in 2012. Her holistic model of the interconnectedness of the global derivatives markets was the first of its kind. The IMF Working Paper \[R4\] on systemic risk from global derivatives, demonstrated using what has become an iconic network graph based on large scale data, the fallacy of composition inherent to models of modern risk management. What is individually optimal may be destabilizing for the system as a whole when risk is removed from individual balance sheets of banks, but concentrated at the system level with 16 broker dealer global banks in the derivatives market. The USD700trillion derivatives markets were implicated in the 2007 financial crisis and Markose became influential in the G20 reform of the over the counter \(OTC\) derivatives. 

 The papers \[R4\-R8\] set out and refine further this network framework for financial contagion that underpins the RBI financial network App \[R9\] based on the ‘eigen\-pair’ method which simultaneously gives a metric, analogous to the epidemic R number, for the tipping points for the instability of the system, along with a Google page rank\-like metric for intermediaries who are systemically important, and those that are systemically vulnerable. This work challenges the mainstream measures of risk. Markose \[R5\] has emphasized the paradox of volatility in market price based systemic risk indices which underestimates risk during asset booms and will spike only contemporaneously with the crisis, giving no early warning. In order to avoid model risk in the estimation of financial networks, Markose has underscored the necessity to mandate who\-to\-whom financial bilateral data \[R9\]. The Markose\-Giansante \[R6, R9\] systemic risk analytics yields an analogue of the epidemic R number for the financial system and also signals which institutions are potential super\-spreaders or are likely to fail. This along with a quantification of the losses based on real \(rather than proxied\) financial exposures, makes the App a powerful tool. All of this underpins the RBI systemic risk App, which has also allowed her to repurpose the software to give an assessment of the efficacy of the G20 reforms for over\-the\-counter derivatives in terms of the Central Clearing Platforms \(CCPs\). Markose, with her group \[R8\], designed skin\-in\-the game capital requirements for CCPs to mitigate their potential to become super systemic and require tax\-payer bailout. Markose credits her complexity perspective to her commitment to using software based holistic network methods to model the financial system and to simulate the impact of policy.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Modelling and reducing systemic risk \(the Reserve Bank of India\)** 

 Based on her research \[R4,R5\], Markose developed one of the earliest and most comprehensive implementations of a large scale data driven financial network software application \(App\) undertaken for financial systemic risk management in a large economy \[S1\].The outputs from the network model and App enabled the Reserve Bank of India \(RBI\) to manage systemic risk in a timely basis \[S1\]. Since 2013, RBI has added the Markose systemic risk network App to their toolbox for monitoring and controlling risk in their financial system. Analysis using the App appears annually in the RBI Financial Stability Reports \[S2\]. 

 In the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis when it was recognized that mainstream financial risk management and macro\-economic models failed, central banks were setting up Financial Stability Units the world over to develop more system\-wide network\-based models for tracking financial contagion. Based on her research \[R4, R5, R6\], Markose was appointed Senior Consultant \(between 2011 and 2015\) for the digital mapping of the Indian Financial System at the newly formed Financial Stability Unit of the Reserve Bank of India \[S3\]. The JAVA software of a multilayer network that covers 1,500 Indian financial institutions, including banks and non\-banks such as insurance companies and mutual funds, was developed by Markose in collaboration with Dr Simone Giansante \[R9\]. Through this project the RBI became one of the first central banks to mandate bilateral who\-to\-whom granular balance sheet data from their financial institutions to set up the digital map of financial flows. As the IMF note this was yet to become the standard in many countries where typically, central banks and mainstream macro\-economic models use highly aggregated data which ignore the actual interbank credit flows and also institutional details that are causal in the ensuing crisis \[S1\]. 

 The outputs from the granular network model allowed RBI to mitigate the systemic risk which identified that an Indian bank was borrowing aggressively in the interbank market and becoming a threat to the system. A network metric developed by Markose\-Giansante showed that this bank, not one of the usual suspects, suddenly moved from rank number five to first rank in terms of network centrality metric over a period of 18 months, signalling its growing threat to the system. Indian regulators benefitted from the early warning capabilities that this network modelling of interconnected balance sheets of financial institutions provides \[S1\]. Markose produced a detailed handbook \[R9\] for the systemic risk App for the RBI Financial Stability Unit staff as well as training them in the theory behind the financial network methods \[S4\]. 

 The IMF Deputy Director Asia Pacific, who conducted the Financial Stability Assessment Program \(FSAP\) for the Reserve Bank of India stated \[S1\]: 

 *“The Indian regulators have benefitted from the early warning capabilities that this network modelling of interconnected balance sheet of financial institutions provides... \[and\] has greatly enhanced the ability of the India regulators to manage systemic risk in a timely basis. It must be noted that Professor Markose first developed some of the methods behind this RBI software for an IMF project on the systemic risk for global derivatives, and this is an area she continues to have considerable impact…it is a remarkable achievement for the project that Markose and Giansante pull off this software implementation...”* 

 **G20 Reforms of Over\-the\-Counter Derivatives market** 

 A collaborative IMF research project led by Markose on the Systemic Risk from Global Financial Derivatives Markets using network analysis in 2012 led to her appointment as an academic advisor for the implementation of the G20 reforms of the global derivatives markets. 

 As one of only four Academic Advisors to the G20 Over\-the\-Counter Derivatives Coordination Group \(ODCG\) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and Financial Stability Board, Markose research \[R4, R5\] was drawn upon in the 2013 Macroeconomic Impact Assessment of OTC Derivatives Regulatory Reforms Report published by the Bank for International Settlements \(BIS\) \[S5\]. BIS chaired the ODCG which evaluated the combined effects of the regulatory reforms that were being implemented following the financial crisis of 2007\-2008. The BIS study, completed under the aegis of Mark Carney as head of the FSB confirmed the primary result that the net benefit of these reforms was roughly 0.12% of global GDP per year justifying the cost to the banks of the proposed reform changes, which have in turn led to a reduction in the counter party risk in Over\-the\-Counter derivative markets \[S5\]. 

 In the 10\-year retrospective of the Great Financial Crisis, Markose was invited to analyse the impact of the G20 financial reforms of global derivatives markets \[S6\] for the Banque de France Financial Stability Review 2017 \[R8\]. Markose’s research and model gave a data driven depiction of the stability or lack of it, for the extant 2017 market infrastructure involving Central Clearing Platforms \(CCP\) for derivatives clearing and gives proof of concept for the design of skin\-in\-game capital requirements for CCPs so that they do not need to be bailed out by tax payers \[R8\]. 

 In 2017 the Governor of the Banque de France, championed Markose research and further stated \[S7\]: 

 *”This 21st edition of the Stability Review \[R8\] shows that the banking and financial regulations adopted since the crisis constitute a major acquis to be preserved because they have made the global financial system more robust. It also stresses the importance of a regular assessment of their impacts in order to consolidate this acquis. Our common challenge now is to preserve and enhance it”.* 

 **Informing regulatory policy debate on systemic risk in banking systems** 

 Markose’s research continues to be drawn upon in regulatory policy debate for example: On 4 July 2018, Markose gave an assessment of systemic risk from Brexit \[S8\] at the Westminster Business Forum: Building a resilient UK financial sector \- next steps for prudential regulation, structural reform and mitigating risks alongside the Deputy Governor and Executive Director of the Bank of England. Attendees included members of Treasury Select Committees. Markose warned about a potential misfiring of repo markets due to the conditions highlighted in her 2017 Banque de France Review \[R8\] and paper \[R7\] co\-authored with Bank of England and Reserve Bank of Australia staff on the large demand for high quality liquid assets needed for CCP clearing and settlement. As monetary and financial systems become increasingly digital, Markose’s expertise led to an invitation as a panellist on systemic risk from cyber\-attacks at the March 2020 Bank of England Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) and Machine learning on the UK Economy \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Despite a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of opioids in the long\-term management of pain, prescribing rates have risen in recent years leading to the so\-called ‘opioid epidemic’. Dundee\-led research investigating the prevalence and impact of chronic pain resulted in the first comprehensive evidence\-based guideline for the assessment and management of chronic pain, SIGN 136. Since publication of the guideline, opioid prescribing has reduced by 19% across Scotland, with similar reductions observed locally in Tayside and Fife. This research on the benefits and risks of opioids prescribed for chronic pain in Scotland has informed the recent \(2019\) revision and update of SIGN 136 and has contributed to other local, national and international prescribing strategies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Opioids are very effective for managing short\-term \(acute\) pain, but there is no evidence for their efficacy as a long\-term treatment: in fact there is increasing evidence of harms, such as adverse physical or emotional effects, misuse, addiction or death, from long\-term use. The Chronic Pain Research Group, established by Smith in 2011 and co\-led by Colvin since 2018 has investigated the prevalence and impact of chronic pain, including neuropathic pain \(pain caused by somatosensory system damage or disease\), for which opioids are often used despite little evidence of effectiveness. Smith and colleagues demonstrated that neuropathic pain is common and impacts on all aspects of health and life, \(with 17% of sufferers describing extremely low associated quality of life, equivalent to “worse than death”\) **\[R1\]**. 

 Working with the Scottish Government National Chronic Pain Steering Group, Smith and Colvin identified the need for evidence\-based guidance on chronic pain management in Scotland. A proposal to produce such guidance was therefore taken to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network \(SIGN\). One of the main challenges identified by stakeholders was the use of opioids for chronic non\-cancer pain; this became a key question in SIGN 136 **\[E3\]**, which remains the only comprehensive evidence\-based guideline for chronic pain assessment and management available globally. 

 Comprehensive community\-based prescribing data for Tayside were obtained through the Health Informatics Centre and used to conduct a cross\-sectional patient\-level analysis. This identified an 18\-fold increase in the rate of strong opioid prescribing in NHS Tayside over a 15\-year period \(1995\-2010\), and the patient factors associated with this \(older age, female gender, polypharmacy\) **\[R2\]**. Although this increase was largely driven by Tramadol \(which was classified as a strong opioid in this study\), established strong opioids, such as morphine and fentanyl, showed 5\-fold increases. 

 Further work identified a research gap around rates and consequences of opioid prescribing in Scotland, which were quantified year\-by\-year from 2003 to 2012, again using national high quality routine prescribing, linked and research\-derived datasets. Potentially dangerous prescribing was scrutinised particularly closely **\[R3\]**. The rate of strong opioid prescribing doubled during the study period; in Scotland \~18% of the population were prescribed an opioid in 2012. Gender and deprivation increased risk for both prescribing and potentially dangerous co\-prescribing of benzodiazepines. Systematic reviews also demonstrated the incidence of iatrogenic opioid misuse/addiction when prescribed for pain \(pooled estimates as high as 4.7%\) and associated factors **\[R4\]**, as well as evidence for opioid induced hyperalgesia and associated factors **\[R5\]**. Separately, Smith co\-led the opioids section in a detailed systematic review of all available pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain **\[R6\]**, conducted as a major update on previous treatment guidelines identified by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group \(NeuPSIG\) of the International Association for the Study of Pain. This found weak evidence for the effectiveness of strong opioids, and none to support their long\-term use.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Colvin and Smith’s work on SIGN 136 influenced Scottish policy and practice with regard to chronic pain \(e.g. level and duration of opioid prescribing\). Their research highlighted the need for local and national guidelines and strategies in order to reduce rates and improve the safety and appropriateness of opioid prescribing in chronic pain not caused by cancer \(for which there is a different prescribing strategy\). This led to the National Chronic Pain Prescribing Strategy **\[E1, E2\]**. Changes in the evidence base led Smith and Colvin to revise the SIGN 136 section on opioids in 2019 **\[E3\]**. 

 This impact has, to date, mostly occurred within Scotland, although there is evidence that it is beginning to extend further afield **\[E10\]**. Colvin and Smith proposed and led development of the 2013 SIGN guideline on Management of Chronic Pain **\[E3, E4\]**. SIGN clinical practice guidelines are always based on rigorous systematic reviews and appraisals of evidence **\[E5\]**. SIGN’s Key Recommendations are important benchmark standards for care and, since its publication, SIGN 136 has formed the basis of pain service provision and improvement in Scotland **\[E4\]**. Its 2013 edition includes evidence\-based guidance on safe and effective opioid prescribing, including the recommendation for prescribers to seek pain specialist review when prescribing reached morphine equivalent doses >180mg/day. This was used as the basis for the Scottish Government’s strategy to reduce opioid\-related harms **\[E4\]**. The National Prescribing Strategy for Chronic Pain was produced in collaboration with the Scottish Government Effective Prescribing and Therapeutics Branch **\[E1, E2\]** and has been used along with SIGN 136 and general practice\-based feedback on opioid prescribing rates to drive reductions in numbers and doses of opioid prescriptions across Scotland, as confirmed by the Healthcare Quality and Improvement Directorate **\[E4\]**: 

 \[SIGN 136\] has been at the centre of all clinical decisions relating to Scottish Government and NHS policy and practice relating to pain management since its publication. It was central to the subsequent Scottish National Pain Prescribing Strategy \(2018\), to which \[Smith and Colvin\] provided additional important input. Its updated Opioids Section \(2019\) continues to inform policy and practice across the country. 

 Recently, we have seen opioid prescribing rates beginning to fall across the country, and we are grateful for the work that Professors Colvin and Smith have led and undertaken to help with this. 

 Smith represents NHS Tayside on the national group overseeing implementation of this strategy. Smith and Colvin sit on the Scottish Government Short Life Working Group on Prescription Medicine Dependence and Withdrawal in Scotland, which aims to guide and support safe prescribing and de\-prescribing of medicines that can cause dependence or withdrawal **\[E1, E2, E4\]**. 

 Noting increasing evidence concerning the harms and lack of long\-term effectiveness of opioids, Colvin and Smith proposed and conducted a revision of the opioids section of SIGN 136 **\[E3\]**. Published in 2019, this provides more detailed evidence\-based guidance and recommendations on safe and effective prescribing and referral for specialist review with morphine equivalent doses >90mg/day. The Chair and Programme Lead of SIGN write **\[E5\]**: 

 Professors Lesley Colvin and Blair Smith… have played a key role in advancing understanding of opioid use in chronic pain, underpinning the opioid guidance in SIGN 136 and its recent update \(2019\). 

 The Royal College of Anaesthetists has incorporated the SIGN 136 approach \(as the only guideline in this area\) into their new Quality Improvement Compendium **\[E6\]**. This includes a chapter \(Section 10.5, by Colvin and Smith\) on long\-term opioid use in chronic pain. This book is distributed to every UK NHS anaesthetics department and is freely available to all online. 

 Colvin sits on the MHRA Opioid Expert Working Group. Following pre\-publication sharing of the SIGN 136 opioid update **\[E5\]**, the MHRA published new guidance on the safe use of opioids, including changes to patient information leaflets, product characteristics and packaging **\[E7, E8, E9\]**. The impact of these changes on opioid prescribing rates in England is yet to be assessed. 

 Internationally, Smith’s involvement with the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group, NeuPSIG \(Management Committee 2010 to 2020, Chair 2016 to 2018\), has included analysis of evidence\-based guidance for pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain **\[R6\]**, which has contributed to and been cited in other international guidelines **\[E10\]**, as well as the SIGN 136 revision **\[E3\]**. Locally, Smith led the development of pathways for managing chronic pain in NHS Tayside, which are used by all prescribers there **\[R6, E1, E2, E3\]**. 

 Opioid prescribing rates have become one of NHS Scotland’s key national therapeutic indicators **\[E4\]** and, following the demonstration that they exhibit wide geographical variation **\[R3\]**, will also feature in Scotland’s Atlas of Healthcare Variation **\[E4\]**. From 2005 to 2013, opioid prescribing rates increased steadily in Scotland, but this trend has changed significantly coincident with the publication of SIGN 136 \(Fig. 1\). Between Q4 2013 and Q1 2020 there was an 18.8% reduction in the number of people prescribed an opioid **\[E11\]**. This change has also been observed at local level since 2014 \(Fig. 2\), in contrast to the UK as a whole. Smith and Colvin’s team established that \~250,000 individuals \(18% of the Scottish population\) were prescribed an opioid in one year **\[R3\]**, placing \~11,750 \(4.7%\) at risk of dependence or abuse **\[R4\]**. An 18.8% reduction in this figure could equate to \~2,200 fewer people/year experiencing this outcome, with substantial population benefits in reduction of other harms and improved Quality of Life **\[E3\]**.

 **Figure 1.** Prescribing rate of opioids in the community in Scotland \(2005 to 2019\). The number of opioid items prescribed and dispensed increased from 2005 until the publication of SIGN 136, but has been declining since 2014. This replicates similar data from Tayside and Fife \(Source: Public Health Scotland\). 


 The impact of the work undertaken by Smith and Colvin on policy and practice relating to opioid prescribing in Scotland is acknowledged at the highest level **\[E2\]**: 

 Over the last decade, the Government and NHS in Scotland have worked to reduce harms associated with the prescribing of opioids. To do this, we have developed strategies to reduce both the number of people receiving an opioid prescription, and the overall doses that are prescribed. 

 Professors Colvin and Smith have contributed importantly to this work and success, through their roles in developing and disseminating SIGN 136 \(2013 and 2019\), their contributions to the National Prescribing Strategy, and their membership of the Scottish Government Short Life Working Group on Prescription Medicine Dependence and Withdrawal.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Impact has been achieved by making high\-profile physics accessible beyond academia through a multi\-strand engagement strategy. Specifically, we have: 

-  **Enhanced physics teachers’ professional practice** and influenced curricula change; 

-  **Improved the awareness of STEM subjects amongst schoolchildren**, leading to these subjects being chosen as career pathways; 

-  **Influenced artists’ creative practice** to explain complex science; 

-  **Improved engagement and reach** with the public’s understanding of physics.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The University of Birmingham’s world\-leading research in Particle Physics and Astronomy sits at the heart of the School’s public engagement strategy. The work of five researchers underpins the impact. They are investigating the fundamental building blocks of nature \( **Particle Physics**: Lazzeroni, Nikolopoulos\), opening a new window on the universe \( **Gravitational Waves**: Freise\) and illuminating the life cycles of stars and their planets \( **Stars and Exoplanets**: Chaplin, Triaud\). 

####  **Particle physics** 

 Since the 1930s, physicists have largely explained the universe through the *Standard Model*. The final piece of this framework came with the discovery at CERN in 2012 of the Higgs boson particle, which attracted the Nobel Prize in Physics. Our physicists led key parts of the analysis that uncovered the Higgs \(Nikolopoulos\) and built part of the ATLAS experiment that detected it \[R1\]. The *Standard Model* cannot however explain everything that we know exists and we are in the forefront of efforts to search for new physics beyond it, using two major experiments at CERN, NA62 and LHCb \[R2\]. Lazzeroni leads the international NA62 collaboration. The overall portfolio underpins our programme of engagement on Particle Physics with schoolchildren \(including workshop activities\). Our experimental detector work underpins our programme deploying particle detectors in schools, which the children use to conduct their own research. 

####  **Gravitational Waves** 

 Einstein’s theory of gravity revolutionised our understanding of space and time. His theory predicted the existence of gravitational waves, created by massive objects such as colliding black holes. In 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory \(LIGO\), an international collaboration we are part of, detected gravitational waves for the first time \[R3, R4\]. This discovery launched a new era in astronomy, revealing previously unseen objects in far\-away galaxies. We have led analyses in LIGO to reveal the astrophysical sources of measured signals. We are one of only three UK universities that built LIGO detector hardware \(Freise\) and this activity underpins work with an artist developing a musical synthesiser based on the detectors. Our development of the widely used gravitational wave detector design software FINESSE was critical in the construction of our gaming apps for mobile phones. 

####  **Stars and Exoplanets** 

 Stars are the building blocks of the Galaxy and provide sources of energy for creating the conditions that may support life on the planets they may host. We are a world leader in using the natural, resonant oscillations of stars \(Chaplin\) — asteroseismology — to characterise and study thousands of stars in our local solar neighbourhood \[R5\]. We use data from our own telescopes and NASA missions to reveal the otherwise hidden interiors of the Sun and stars. The resonances are due to trapped sound waves, like those of a musical instrument, and the use and interpretation of stellar oscillations and the pictures they paint of stellar interiors underpins our work with artists. We are also involved in breakthrough discoveries and studies of exoplanet systems \(Triaud\) \[R6\]. Our work with artists uses data on the characteristics and orbits of these newly discovered planets.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have improved the confidence of school teachers to teach physics and provided them with tools to do so, and we have improved the perception of STEM subjects amongst schoolchildren \(primary and secondary\) and made these subjects more accessible. We have enabled under\-represented cohorts to feel they can continue with STEM subjects in higher education, and we have enhanced public understanding of physics through collaborations with artists to facilitate improved communication of science. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Enhancing physics teachers’ professional practice and their capacity to teach physics**</ins> 

 **The way school teachers deliver physics curricula and syllabi has changed** as a result of them participating in our training programmes \(Lazzeroni\), which are underpinned by lessons and resources based our Particle Physics research \[R1, R2\]. Specifically: 

 **Over 300 primary schoolteachers from the UK, Italy and Greece delivered our lessons and resources in their schools** after we had trained them \[A, E\]. This exposed children to cutting\-edge physics research for the first time and reached around 5,000 UK children at more than 10% of primary schools in the West Midlands. Two international pilots reached around 550 children in Italy and 750 in Greece \[A, E\]. It was our dissemination of best practice in the educational literature \[H\] that led to the Italian programme, in which we trained teachers from 20 schools in collaboration with the Italian National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Research \(INFN\) \[A, E\]. The programme is in the process of being formally adopted \(from 2021/22\) as part of the teachers’ training programme at the University of Turin \[E\]. 

 **A key change which resulted from our programme was that teachers are more confident to deliver physics in lessons.** A Head Teacher in Italy said: “one of the key aspects of the program, namely the training of teachers by scientists, has been crucial in enabling the teachers to acquire a confident knowledge of the subjects” \[E\]. As a proxy indicator, of the 50 UK and Greek teachers we trained through the CERN pilot project *Playing with Protons* \[A, G\] which includes our resources, 100% said they had become more creative in their teaching methods and 80% confirmed that their confidence to deliver lessons had increased \[C\]. 

 **Our programmes have also changed how educators approach their everyday practice.** Of 900 UK secondary schoolteachers who undertook our training, around half of those surveyed said there would be visible changes in their daily teaching delivery, and 78% said they would use our resources \[C\]. This equates to changing practice at one in ten of UK secondary schools, and the majority of those in the West Midlands. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Improved the awareness of, and attitudes towards, STEM subjects among primary and secondary school pupils**</ins> 

 Perceptions of science have been positively changed for those cohorts of **primary and secondary schoolchildren in the UK and Italy who** engaged in our programmes. Specifically: 

 **Understanding, attitude and interest towards physics was promoted amongst schoolchildren** though our *World of Particles*, *Particle Physics through Visual Art* and *Particle Dance* programmes, which used activities based around play, drawing and sculpture to teach Particle Physics and our latest results at CERN \[R1, R2\]. This is bridging the gap between making science physically accessible, and understandable and relevant, which is essential to capturing students’ interest during their education. These engagements improved levels of understanding of physics, shown by the fact that of 595 primary schoolchildren at 17 UK schools who participated in *World of Particles*, 90% reported that they had spoken to their family about what they had learnt and 95% were able to correctly recall information taught on the programme over a month later \[C\]. *World of Particles* was developed with the Ogden Trust, supported by a prestigious STFC Public Engagement Fellowship \(Lazzeroni\). This impact was recognised through the award of the 2019 Institute of Physics *Lise Meitner Medal and Prize* to Lazzeroni for “her exceptional innovation and leadership in making contemporary Particle Physics accessible to a large and diverse audience.” 

 The programmes have **made physics a more accessible subject** \[H\], with more than three quarters of the 200 children who took part in the *Particle Physics through Visual Art* and *Particle Dance* workshops confirming this. Nikolopoulos won the inaugural *ERC Public Engagement with Research Award* \(2020\) for this “impact on people that are not the regular audience for frontier science.” Children’s interest in science has also improved through their participation in the programme, with 93% of the 595 UK children and 75% of the 550 Italian children who took part reporting that they were more interested in science than before \[A, C, E\]. 

 **We have made** **studying STEM subjects at university and pursuing a career in science more attractive for secondary school students**, especially for women and for those from disadvantaged groups. We did this through our student\-led research programme \[A, C, E, G\] where schoolchildren used particle detectors \[R1, R2\] from the European HiSPARC Project to perform their own research. We engaged 1,650 children in 13 regional schools. 90% of the 2015 cohort who were surveyed in detail decided to pursue science in Higher Education compared to fewer than 10% considering this before \[C, E\]. Half of the schools are from deprived areas, with a quarter in the most deprived decile \[A\]. Ensuring that students from these backgrounds, who tend to lack science capital, have opportunities to engage further in this area is important in terms of its contribution to diversification in STEM subjects. Around half of this cohort were female students, who are also less likely to study a STEM subject at university or enter a STEM career than their male counterparts; enhancing their understanding and enthusiasm for science subjects is vital to ensuring that the field is more inclusive. To give an example, one HiSPARC year\-group from Bordesley Green Girls School in an under\-privileged area of Birmingham presented their work at a Royal Society Summer Exhibition. Their teacher said “some were mistaken for undergraduates and offered jobs\!” \[E\]. This change in attitudes was also seen among those on the *Particle Physics through Visual Art* workshops, of which 33% reported being more likely to study physics at university than they were before the activity \[H\]. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Influencing artists’ creative practice to explain complex science and improve their audience reach**</ins> 

 **New ways of thinking among artists have been generated** through our co\-production of exhibitions, performances and events \[A, E\]. Working with artists who employ sound, dance, opera, photography, film and technology, our PHYART@UoB programme produced **new forms of artistic expression** — inspired by and incorporating all areas of the underpinning research \(Chaplin \[lead\], Triaud, Nikolopoulos and Freise\) \[R1–R6\] — and ultimately **enabled the artists to reach audiences in new settings** \[A, C\]. One artist said that working together had “fostered new relationships and platforms to share the work”, while another stated that “sharing ideas with direct feedback and applying them directly afterwards allowed for richer and creative compositions” \[E\]. Key examples of this extended audience reach are the presence of our collaborative work at science museums \(Thinktank, Birmingham; We The Curious, Bristol\) and science festivals \(e.g. Oxford IF\) with a combined audience of almost 14,000 \[A\] who otherwise may not have engaged with this novel interconnection of art and science. 

 These collaborations, which benefit both science and the arts, have been **identified as exemplars of best practice** in the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement’s \(NCCPE\) consultation and report on how researchers and artists can work together to engage the public with research \[G\]; and in the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) *Cultural Value Project*, which looked at why the arts and culture matter and how we capture the effects that they have \[G\]. That this has enhanced creativity within the STEM field is evident through *Wire* music magazine’s review of our work with artist Devine, which stated it “reminds you that it’s still possible to factor in human imagination and physical presence into our understanding of the universe, something that’s missing from so many other big data projects” \[F\]. 

##### 1.  <ins> **Improving the public’s engagement and understanding of physics and extending its reach**</ins> 

 **Public audiences’ perceptions of physics have changed** through their engagement with our research \[R1–R6; C, E\], especially around how art and science can intersect to better communicate science. This has enabled members of the public to make new connections between physics and the world around them \(90% of those surveyed \[C\]\) and changed their views on how artists and scientists can work together to communicate science \(>90% \[C\]\). Audiences we interviewed at our public events said they had learned new ideas \(98% \[C\]\) and more than 80% wanted to find out more and would continue to talk and think about the event they attended. These changed perceptions help citizens appreciate and value the relevance of STEM science to their everyday lives, which is important given the vital contribution of STEM to the prosperity of society. 

 Our work with artists has been picked up in the mainstream media, which enabled this change in perception to reach millions more people. This includes popular Channel 4 programme *Gogglebox* featuring a BBC news segment on our asteroseismology research \[R5\] — including turning stellar oscillations data into sound, which underpins our work with artists Devine and Robson — that reached millions of people \[B\], as well as multiple BBC radio programmes featuring our work \[B\]. One presenter stated “what a totally astounding, amazing project.” 

 We used a range of approaches to achieve this and extend the reach to alternative audiences, including: 

-  Co\-productions with artists as part of our PHYART@UoB programme \[A, E\], which engaged 15,000 people at live performances and exhibitions \[A\]; 

-  Developing and making available gaming apps for mobile phones, based on gravitational wave detectors \[R3, R4\], which have been downloaded by the public almost 40,000 times and one game completed more than 15,000 times \[D\]. Freise was awarded the 2017 *Education and Outreach Award* by the LIGO collaboration in recognition of his pioneering efforts in creating LIGO\-oriented interactive educational applications; 

-  Traditional forms of engagement, demonstrating particle and gravitational waves detectors \[R1–R4\] at Royal Society Summer Exhibitions \(2014–2017\) and other national science festivals, to a total audience of over 130,000 \[A\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The mental health and wellbeing of professional athletes in general and, in particular, sports which emphasize ‘mental toughness’ and are considered to reinforce masculine stereotypes, has been highlighted as an area of concern. Research conducted at the University of Huddersfield has identified key areas of improvement in welfare support in elite\-level rugby league. As a result of the research, the Rugby Football League \(RFL\) made policy changes \(affecting all twelve Super League clubs across the UK, France and Canada\), which have markedly improved the service Player Welfare Managers \(PWMs\) can provide for players. Benefits include increased awareness, uptake and access to player welfare, and mental health benefits for both players and PWMs. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Professional rugby players have traditionally had limited welfare support, with the majority of support directed towards improving on\-field support. However, professional rugby players are in a vulnerable position with short careers, uncertain contracts and a reluctance to seek help. Prevalence of anxiety and depression in male elite athletes in team sports is as high as 45% and rugby has been described as having a ‘toxic culture’ of denial of mental health problems. 

 The research, undertaken at the University of Huddersfield, was conducted between 2015\-2016 led by Dr Kiara Lewis in collaboration with Dr Susanna Kola\-Palmer and Dr Alison Rodriguez. The work was also supported by undergraduate and PhD students at the University. The team worked closely with the Player Welfare Director \(PWD\) in devising the study aims and objectives and she \(PWD\) was instrumental in feeding the results back to the RFL \[5.1\]. The research produced evidence on the needs, assets, deficits and future requirements of welfare support which was fed back to the RFL who then made substantial changes to policy and practice to change welfare provision across the sport. Specifically, the research has contributed in the following ways: 

1.  **Demonstrated to the RFL that the players’ attitudes and knowledge of the availability of mental health support is a significant independent correlate of their mental well\-being.** 

 Lewis, Kola\-Palmer and Rodriguez used an anonymous online survey of professional rugby players to assess their knowledge of and attitudes to RFL player welfare. The survey incorporated psychometrically sound, standardised measures of mental health, psychological stress and athletic identity as well as specific questions on the then current welfare provision to assess awareness \[3.2\]. In year one, 77 players completed the survey \(25%\), and in year two 169 players \(47%\) completed the survey. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time UK and French elite rugby football league players have been surveyed and levels of symptoms of mental health mapped and, it is also the first\-time elite athletes’ engagement with, knowledge of and attitudes to sport player welfare have been investigated. The relationship between more positive attitudes and knowledge of mental health support to better mental health, is a novel and important finding in RFL \[3.3\]. The results suggest that endeavours to increase positive attitudes and knowledge, and to reduce mental health stigma, may have real benefits in terms of increasing mental health. 

1.  **Emphasised that PWMs perceived they were unable to support all the players’ needs in the time available and felt under considerable pressure themselves with, at times, little support from clubs and coaches.** 

 A qualitative study using total purposive sampling was conducted with the PWMs, in total 11 of the 12 PWMs across the UK and France were interviewed in the first year and 12 of the 14 in the second year. The interviews that were conducted used an asset\-based approach to identify the assets, deficits and opportunities. The findings showed that PWMs perceived demands of the job were, for many, too high on a part\-time basis \(a majority of clubs had PWMs on 3 day a week contracts\) and in some cases was impacting on their own welfare. They felt that they were unable to provide all the welfare support needed and that they were being impeded from their job by a lack of support from the club and coaches \(without buy\-in from the coach, players would not engage\) \[3.1\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 A report was produced for the Rugby Football League \(RFL\) following each year of the study \[5.2/5.3\]. The reports were given to the Player Welfare Director \(PWD\) who took them to the RFL board, Chief Executive Officers and coaches at each club, and the Player Welfare and Education Forum which brings together key stakeholders in player welfare. The reports were therefore viewed by those with managerial and everyday responsibility for player welfare at all twelve Super League clubs \(with responsibility for approximately 400 players\). The research was deemed essential by the PWD for the changes in welfare provision to occur: “ *People are probably sick of hearing the University of Huddersfield Survey said, because I use it all the time, because it does just give the outside validation to something. It creates a greater impression; it’s much more difficult to be argued against when it’s done independently*” \[5.4\]. 

 The research led to the following benefits to the people involved in professional rugby league: 

1.  Increased support for the mental health of PWMs 

1.  Increased awareness of welfare support and more positive attitudes of players 

1.  Employment of full\-time PWMs through a change in RFL policy 

1.  More positive attitude of clubs towards welfare support 

 **1. Increased support for PWMs’ mental health \(Quality of Life impact\):** 

 One of the recommendations from the first report was that a support strategy was needed for PWMs as well as additional qualifications and training \[5.1\]. This was picked up by the RFL and thereafter PWMs were provided with a workshop by Sporting Chance \(who provide mental health support\) to help them in recognising signs of depression. The PWMs have also had to undergo formal supervision through Sporting Chance at least once a year. Additional sessions are now offered if the PWM has had to deal with a particularly traumatic event \[5.4\]. Following the second report the RFL agreed to continue to centrally fund Sporting Chance so their services are free to all players and PWMs who need them \[5.3\]. This has been recognised by PWMs as important in supporting their own mental health; when asked what impact the report had had on him personally one PWM replied “ *The bits of care for us as Welfare Managers has been good. So, the opportunity to speak to somebody from Sporting Chance has been valuable and I have done it a couple of times because we take on a lot, we do take a lot on ourselves, everyone dumps their problems on us at times*” \[5.5\]. 

 **2. Change in awareness and attitudes of players towards welfare \(in particular mental health\) support \(cultural impact\):** 

 The first report recommended that the RFL needs to further reinforce and communicate the importance of player welfare priorities, and players should be made aware of welfare policy and know who their player welfare manager is \[5.2\]. Following the release of the report all players \(currently over 400 players across twelve clubs in UK, France\) were provided with a booklet outlining the player welfare provisions that are available to them. PWMs were encouraged to present to all players at the start of the season and to hold a social occasion for players’ parents and partners to explain the provision that is in place \[5.6\]. 

 The results of the second survey showed that player awareness had improved: 75% of players \(compared with 69% in 2015\) now know their club has a welfare policy and 78% \(compared with 58% in 2015\) know how to access mental health support \[5.3\]. This is supported by player X “ *I wasn’t aware of all the support and the welfare that was around where I feel like \(PWM\) and the club make a conscious effort now and making everything clear of what you can get and help and everything*” \[5.7\]. 

 There are a number of other quotes from the second round of interviews \(following changes made following the first set of interviews\) with the PWMs. These illustrate the PWMs’ experience of the changes in awareness and attitudes of players as a result the research: 

 *“Players are now asking me types of questions which they weren’t asking a couple of years ago, do you know what I mean* \[Interviewer *: yeah*\] *. So yes, its busier, but its busy because a lot of it is now being driven by the lads asking questions as opposed to me having to go to them”* \[5.7\] 

 *“It’s \(Sporting Chance\) vital and again in that culture shift, now that one or two lads have had help and received help and know there’s help out there, it’s encouraging others to speak up”* \[5.7\] 

 Interviewer *: “do you think, has there been any change in the culture of whether or not players will seek help and seek advice?”*  Respondent *: “Yes, yes, because the more it becomes public, as long as it’s out there, the players have sought help and when players are going round doing presentations of, you know, sticking their hand up and saying ‘look, I had depression, I were an alcoholic, I had a gambling addiction’, that sends a message across then, that yeah, it all of a sudden becomes acceptable”* \[5.7\] 

 *“I think speaking as myself, as a former player, I think the cultural changes, the perception of Sporting Chance and the range of services they offer have certainly changed. As I say, it was, at first, it was oh he’s a drug addict, or he’s a gambler or he’s an alcoholic and its certainly not that. I think we really appreciate the vast array of services that they offer”* \[5.7\] 

 **3. Change in RFL policy to ensure all clubs employ a full time PWM \(Public Policy impact\):** 

 The second report \[5.3\], having found that PWMs were struggling with the demands of the job, recommended that the all Super League clubs should have a full\-time PWM \(the majority at this time were employed on 3 days per week contracts as the role was not considered to be as important as other club roles\). Following the recommendation, the RFL announced that all 12 Super League clubs would have a full time PWM \[5.9\]. Further revisions to the Player Welfare Policy included reference to ‘Athletic Identity’ \(as players whose identify was more closely linked to being a rugby player, rather than a husband, parent etc., were at greater risk\), an increase in career 1\-2\-1s, and a more structured policy of targeting ‘hard to reach’ players \[5.10\]. The move to full\-time has been recognised by the PWMs as the most important change for them.  “ *For us, I suppose one of the main things that came out of it \(the research\) was clubs moving to full time provision*” \[5.5\] and how that benefits players “ *the biggest benefit to me of it being full time is the time that I have to spend with players, without any other responsibilities*” \[5.5\], they go on to explain it can benefit both players’ mental health and performance “ *I feel if you get the welfare provision right at the club, there is a, there is added benefits actually from the performance point of view as well*” \[5.5\]. 

 **4. Change in attitude of clubs towards welfare support \(Social Impact\):** 

 In the first report the high risk of depression of players was highlighted. Having received this information there were changes in practices to make player’s mental health more prominent. This is supported through correspondence with the PWD \[5.6\] “ *Information on depression has now meant we have a more strategic way of “screening” the lads every morning. This means there are daily well\-being surveys but also a 6 weekly mental health questionnaire to try and pick up on any signs*” \[5.6\] 

 The RFL Player Welfare Policy has been revised to follow a holistic personal development model. Workshops included time management, mindfulness etc. Our research is referenced in the policy guidance \[5.10\] and attracted lots of media coverage \(over 15 articles in local, regional, national and international news outlets\). 

 This change has been seen from all areas of the RFL structure as described by a PWM: 

 *“I would think more so in the last sort of eighteen months, I think, he’s \(CEO\) coming to understand that the role \(PWM\) is a necessity within the Clubs and I think that, you know, I’m actually benefitting from that*” \[5.8\]. 

 As a Canadian club has now entered the Super League the policy and practical changes are being implemented across all clubs in the UK, France and Canada.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 In 2015, there were 65.3 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, with a high proportion living in camps for extended periods of time, some over several generations. Isayev’s research on ancient mobility has shown that while such rates of human mobility are not unique, camps designed to cope with forced migration have few parallels in the past and are a recent political compromise that limits the rights and freedoms of refugees. The long perspective offered by Isayev’s research on mobility and constructions of place, hospitality and belonging, and her wide\-ranging, collaborative work with refugee communities, artists, NGOs, educationalists, and policymakers across Europe, Africa and the Middle East exposed new and diverse forms of agency, self\-representation, archiving and heritage\-building, thereby counteracting victimisation of refugees, and achieved the following impacts: 

-  **Challenged assumptions around mobil**ity as being outside of the norm and **reshaped discourses of belonging and heritage** engaging with practitioners in refugee camps. 

-  **Engaged international artistic practice** to promote reflection on, and self\-expression of the predicament of people who are displaced. 

-  **Transformed perception of migration** through educational activities and offered educational and teaching opportunities for refugees. 

-  **Contributed to UK and international heritage policy discourse**.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 For over a decade, human mobility, displacement and constructions of place and belonging have been central to Isayev’s work, and collective initiatives, involving NGOs, international artists and scholars in confronting these themes. Her investigative laboratory has been primarily the ancient world, employing diverse forms of evidence and reading it against the grain. In particular, she employs contemporary discourse on constructions of place and relational approaches to spatiality. These are used to gain a better understanding of the past and to position contemporary concerns within a broader discourse, thus emphasising the transience of current socio\-cultural conventions. 

 **Mobility and construction of place** 

 Isayev’s monograph, *Migration, Mobility and Place in Ancient Italy* \[ **3.1**\], challenges prevailing conceptions of a natural tie to the land and a demographically settled world, arguing that much human mobility was cyclical and ongoing. Starting from ancient Italy, it highlights moments of change in conceptualising mobility and those on the move, and reframes notions of belonging by drawing on theories from geographical discourse, and what it means to experience the world relationally. The research for this book was made possible by fellowships from the Davis Centre at Princeton and the AHRC \(2010\-12\). This theme of mobility was also explored in her articles on diaspora \[ **3.3**\] and the visibility of those on the move \[ **3.5**\], which emerge from Isayev’s long\-standing interest in theories of generational conflict, globalisation and diaspora. 

  

 **Displacement and the institution of asylum and refugeehood** 

 Isayev’s research also specifically explores the institution of asylum and refugeehood in an interdisciplinary and international context. This research is concerned with the agency and role of those who have been displaced, drawing on insights from the ancient world, and working with colleagues and partners in contemporary refugee contexts \[ **3.2**\]. Building on recent challenges to the conceptualisation of statelessness, human rights, citizenship, and borders, it assesses the extent to which the political practices of people who are displaced defy their condition of rightlessness \[ **3.6**\]. It also addresses the extent to which the ‘right to have rights’ \(H. Arendt\) still remains within the confines of a state\-centric international law, despite advances in the institutionalisation of human rights norms \[ **3.4**\]. Supported by research fellowships \(Australia’s National University, 2017, and University of Tübingen’s Center for Advanced Studies, 2018\), Isayev developed a research programme to chart diachronically the transformation of the relationship between hospitality and asylum, and the way it is affected by changes in state structure, the emergence of empire and the nation\-state. 

 **Belonging, archives and knowledge** 

 The third strand of Isayev’s research brings together the different elements above and allows them to be put into practice, in considering how knowledge creation is affected by contexts of hospitality and hostility, and how these relate to space and place \[ **3.4**\]. This research seeks to critically analyse the archive as a site of negotiation about visions of the future created through a curated view of the past, and read it against the grain to bring out its multi\-vocality. Isayev is co\-investigator with Staffan Müller\-Wille on the BA/Leverhulme\-funded project ‘Knowledges in Transit’, which looks at Linnaeus’s Lapland expedition journal, and uses translation and travel as innovative tools for decolonising the archive. Isayev reads the journal to expose the indigenous and women’s knowledge, among others, that Linnaeus relied on. This pilot project allowed Isayev and Müller\-Wille to follow parts of his route in Finland and Sweden, and to build a network of potential collaborators in the humanities, arts and heritage sector. 

 In January 2020, Isayev was awarded, as PI, a GCRF Network Plus grant \(£150k development grant, £2 million for the network grant\) for the project ‘Imagining Futures through Un/Archived Pasts’. This aims to create protocols for egalitarian archival practices that challenge a singular ‘we’ and, employing dissensus methodologies, allows for co\-existence and recognition of multiple experiences and narratives of the past. The grant forges a partnership with American University of Beirut, British Research Institutes Overseas, UCL, Central Saint Martins, University of Arts London, University of Ghana, University of Stellenbosch, and Stella Maris University College in Tanzania, as well as several non\-academic partners. Despite the delays caused by the COVID\-19 crisis, the network activities have already connected creators and institutions in Africa, the Middle East, North America and Europe – currently, for example, with a joint agreement between the research team and Lindi Regional Commissioners Office for a funding application to create a Future Memory Culture Centre in Tanzania’s Lindi province.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Isayev’s impact activities have been based on both direct interaction with refugees and migrants, and collaboration with organisations and individuals taking the impact beyond her initial direct involvement. 

 **Reshaping discourses of heritage and belonging with and in refugee camps** 

 Isayev’s research is changing discourses relating to the refugee experience and **increasing opportunities for self\-representation** by asylum seekers and refugees. Since 2015, Isayev has worked with Campus in Camps, an experimental educational platform working with West Bank refugee camps, and Decolonising Architecture \(DAAR\), which combines architecture, art and activism to deliver new forms of critique, political engagement and collective learning. In November 2015, she delivered two workshops at the Dheisheh refugee camp, where approximately 15,000 refugees live \[ **5.1**\]. Drawing insights from her work on ancient migration \[ **3.1**\], the workshops reconsidered contemporary concerns among displaced communities around heritage, belonging, identity, and borders. They looked at projects in public spaces which transgress existing social, cultural and political power structures that limit ‘minority’ place\-making, and thus critique integration. They **delivered new ways of representing camps and refugees** to an audience of 60\-80, which included volunteers, residents of camps, architects, community workers, academics and students \[ **5.1**\]. Participating groups included Riwaq \(a heritage rehabilitation and conservation organisation based in Ramallah and working with surrounding communities\), Al\-Finieq \(a community and learning centre in the Dheisheh camp\), and Detour \(a community group that leads an alternative tourist tour through refugee camps and surrounding Palestinian region\). According to DAAR founder Alessandro Petti, the workshops **produced new ideas about constructing histories and alternative storytelling** that were tested in touring through refugee camps. He stated that these ideas “will be used to conduct new tours with different audiences around the Refugee Campus” and anticipated that the new methods **would affect 2,500\-12,000 beneficiaries per year**, including visitors, campus communities and guides \[ **5.1**\]. 

 Further engaging with the forms of alternative knowledge, representation and belonging within camps, in 2018 Isayev visited Beirut and Burje Refugee Camp to explore practices of self\-archiving and potential for future archiving by camp residents. The visit led to an invitation to draw on her work on migration, hospitality and displacement \[ **3.4**, **3.6**\], and present at an annual gathering of professionals, academics, and students in the Beirut *City Debates*, an event dedicated to issues of urbanisation in the region \[ **5.2**\]. This collaboration was extended into the GCRF\-funded ‘Imagining Futures through Un/Archived Pasts’, with the Arab Palestinian Cultural Club based in Badawi camp in Lebanon as one of the partners. The latter commended the 2019 fieldwork at the camp and the project for “‘its focus on creative and participatory practices including photography, oral histories and creative writing, leading to workshops and exhibitions in the camp \[which\] will be of great interest and benefit to the members of the camp” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **Using art to promote reflection on and self\-expression of displaced communities** 

 Art is a powerful means of conveying messages and of self\-expression, especially in emotional and challenging contexts. Isayev’s collaborations with creative practitioners have **influenced their practices and contributed to the representation and public understanding of people who are displaced** in Europe and the Middle East. Building on the success of her work with Campus in Camps, in 2017 Isayev co\-founded \(with architect Diego Segatto \[Italy\] and critical pedagogue Isshaq AlBarbary \[Palestine\]\) Almaisha \[ **5.4**\]. This initiative critically explores hospitality, collective learning and politics beyond the nation state, drawing on her research on ancient and contemporary perspectives on these issues \[ **3.1**; **3.2**; **3.4**; **3.6**\]. Almaisha delivered collaborative artworks and workshops in Germany \(e.g. with Bauhaus Museum Dessau, to develop new forms of pedagogy that promote collective learning \[ **5.5**\]\), the Netherlands and Greece, plus joint initiatives between the UK and Palestine \[ **5.4**\]. These activities have **promoted the understanding of the experience of displaced communities** in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. 

 Isayev’s work with Almaisha has also **enabled unique and profound opportunities for creative self\-expression for refugees**, while **preserving understanding of the refugee experience**. In 2018, Almaisha collaborated with the Office of Displaced Designers \(ODD\), an organisation that brings together designers from displaced and host communities in Lesvos. Here, Almaisha used collective practice also to enact Isayev’s findings on hospitality, agency and belonging, including ancient mapping \[ **3.1**, **3.4**\]. This resulted in transformational experiences for participants. An asylum seeker, Aref Husseini \(who had previously described himself as an ‘uninvited guest’ on Lesvos\), reported: *“*Personally it was an amazing experience for me … **I learned to** **see the world from a new perspective when it comes to belonging and place**, to understand in depth \[and\] I decided to study philosophy. *”* \[ **5.6**\] The ODD collaboration led to an exhibition on the island and the co\-authorship of the volume *Inhabiting* \(2018\). This is part of Almaisha’s ‘collective dictionary’ series, following on from the Campus in Camps publications, which contain definitions of concepts created in the processes of collective practice and learning, and are themselves forms of alternative archiving \[ **5.4**\]. 

 Almaisha was also invited to join a collaboration with the Franco\-Moroccan women's collective Calypso3621 **°** on its programme Out.of.the.blue.map, which brought together artists, curators, researchers and activists to create an alternative map of the Mediterranean in order to address the issues of permanent liminality and the governance systems that affect its borders. Isayev was engaged by Calypso3621° because her “interdisciplinary and inter\-practice approaches **lead to collective learning and research beyond the academy**” \[ **5.5**\]. The resulting output is exhibitions in Morocco and Marseille, as part of the Manifesta13 2020 biennale, unfortunately postponed due to COVID\-19. 

 **Transforming perception of migration and refugees through educational activities and offering educational opportunities for refugees** 

 Another important volume in the ‘collective dictionary’ series, which also features on the Campus in Camps website, was *Xenia* \(2019\) \[ **5.4**\], co\-written by Isayev, her Almaisha collaborators, and her 3<sup>rd</sup> year BA and MA students on the Ancient Journeys and Migrants course at the University of Exeter. The course creates forms of practice\-based and community\-engaged learning and is a platform for collaborative activities that **transform perceptions of migration and refugehood**. In early 2019, Isayev worked with students to organise a project with a Palermo\-based collective Giocherenda **\[5.7\]**, comprising young migrants from several African countries who create games about storytelling and sharing, and engage communities in migration issues. The project focused on producing educational and creative opportunities to challenge attitudes and misconceptions about immigrants among children and the local Devon communities, building on Isayev’s work on refugee agency and displacement \[ **3.2**; **3.5**\]. 

 Mustapha Conteh, a member of Giocherenda, visited Exeter in January\-February 2019, where he worked with Isayev’s students to deliver day\-long workshops with Year 7 pupils of Pilton Community College in Barnstaple, using Giocherenda’s method and other original activities to help pupils reimagine migration and movement. The experience **positively contributed to pupils’ understanding and attitudes**. Teachers commented that “…as a rural school in North Devon, pupils are not often confronted with ideas of migration, so it was good to **challenge those ideas**” and that “it has **opened up some discussions** in class in regards to migration and current news events”. \[ **5.7**\]. Mustapha, who joined the programme driven by Giocherenda’s ambition to raise awareness about migration \(he highlights one of the Barnstaple pupils noting that they thought “that only birds migrate”\) described the visit as “enlightening” \[ **5.7**\]. Giocherenda and Isayev’s students also worked with community organisation Refugee Support Devon \(RSD\), to organise a music jam session between students, locals and refugees. 

 Isayev acted as a trustee for RSD between 2015 and 2019. RSD attested to her **contribution to the organisation’s strategic direction**, informed by her research on the institutions of asylum and refugeehood \[ **3.2**, **3.4**, **3.6**\], as being of great benefit, and especially her “spearhead\[ing\] the establishment of Exeter University as a University of Sanctuary”. “This has enabled a number of RSD’s clients to access scholarships at the university. Over the last year, four have been enabled to take up degree courses.” \[ **5.8**\] Since 2017, the university has offered three scholarships per annum. A scholarship recipient has noted that the scholarship: 

 *“removed the obstacle of accessing education as a refugee \[and\] allowed me to have a roof over my head in a warm room I can call my own for the first time on this continent. It also paved the way for me to focus on the things that matter the most and on a personal level, such as social integration and building a network. This scholarship allowed me to move on after the atrocities I have faced in my home country and abroad since 2011.”* \[ **5.9**\]. 

  

 RSD’s chair also cites the benefit of the continuous link that Isayev provides “between RSD staff, volunteers and service users, \[and\] the university” \[ **5.8**\], **enabling learning experiences** such as the music session, but also activities such as joint dinners and coastal walks \(one of which in 2018 brought together around 35 refugee families, students and locals\) \[ **5.8**\]. 

 The learning activities with RSD and Giocherenda in 2019 also led to an interactive summary *The Storytelling Collective*, created by students, which aimed to *“*establish refreshed methods of discussing migration, journeys and the stories and networks that are created through them” \[ **5.7**\]. Exeter students and guests who organised and participated in these activities spoke about their transformational effect, not only by lending “more human, mental and emotional aspects to the themes and academic ideas we discussed in the ‘traditional’ lectures every week”, but also by having a **significant effect on their personal, professional, and even political choices**. In the words of another student: “The project and ideas surrounding it **have permeated almost everything I have done since**, and I am thankful for the awareness it has provided me.” \[ **5.7**\] 

 **Contributing to UK and international heritage policy** 

 In 2020 Isayev was invited to contribute her expertise to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, to help shape UK policy concerning heritage and UN sustainable development goals \[ **5.10**\]. On a supranational level, her research on migration and reading archives against the grain led to her invitation \[ **5.10**\] by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction to join a UN Expert Panel in collaboration with the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, to develop a *Words to Action Guide* on ‘Using traditional knowledge for disaster risk reduction’. The guide **provides advice to countries and practitioners on policies, programmes and innovative projects for mitigating, preparing and responding to various disaster risks**. The guide will assist in the implementation of critical aspects of the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\-2030. **\[5.10\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In the wake of the Ebola epidemic, Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research has significantly shaped changes to healthcare policy in Sierra Leone resulting in a health insurance scheme which positively impacts the lives of an estimated 2.7 million people working in the informal sector and provides free healthcare for children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Prior to 2018, financial barriers prevented poor and vulnerable populations from accessing healthcare services. Research by Jofre\-Bonet on healthcare provision, the interaction of public and private suppliers, willingness to pay for health products and health insurance, underpinned the premium that was set, as well as the design and enactment of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme. She also advised the government on the specifics of the implementation of the scheme from 2016 to 2018, enabling its successful introduction. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s body of research examines how health economics can contribute to improving healthcare systems, including cost\-effectiveness of treatments and Willingness To Pay \(WTP\) for healthcare products and services. Her work in Low\- and Middle\-Income Countries \(LMICs; defined by gross national income per capita and development assistance from The Organisation for Economic Co\-operation and Development, OECD\) included being part of a £1.5m project in the Gambia, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that compared the infection rates and cost effectiveness of two antibiotic administration strategies for trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. \[3.1\] In Brazil, Jofre\-Bonet and co\-authors investigated the Zika Virus epidemic in the first study exploring the economic and social impacts in depth. \[3.2\] Both of these projects applied health system economics and societal perspective methodologies to healthcare issues faced in LMICs, with the aim of developing efficient and effective health policy. This case study presents the further extension of this approach in Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research on healthcare system reform in Sierra Leone. 

1.  **\(i\) WTP for improvements in healthcare in the informal sector in Sierra Leone** 

 Sierra Leone is a West African Low\-Income country with a population of around 7.3 million people and a life expectancy at birth of 60 years, according to  [World Health Organisation](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.cco.ki-SLE) \(WHO\) figures. In ‘post\-conflict’ reconstruction since the end of the civil war in 2002, it is estimated to have the world’s highest maternal mortality \(WHO\). Accessible and affordable healthcare services are a critical component of Sierra Leone’s economic and social development priorities. The civil war left the country economically vulnerable, with a fragmented healthcare system dependant almost entirely on the support of financial donors, and one of the highest rates of out\-of\-pocket health expenditure in the world. This means ill\-health can push people into poverty as they use savings, assets, or borrowing to pay for healthcare. After the loss of nearly 4,000 lives in the 2014\-15 Ebola crisis, the Government’s  [Health Sector Recovery Plan \(2015\-20\)](https://mohs2017.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/health-sector-recovery-plan-2015-2020.docx) identified the need for a universal health insurance system. The  [Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey](https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-FR365-DHS-Final-Reports.cfm) \(2019, p. 38\) found that 96% of people aged 15\-49 do not have health insurance. 

 Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research focused specifically on willingness to pay \(WTP\) for improvements in healthcare in the ‘Informal Sector’. This sector encompasses small\-scale enterprise and business activities focused on the production of goods or services; those involved are likely to work on a casual labour basis and/or with family members, i.e. there is no formal contractual relationship. The World Bank\* finds that ‘Informality is pervasive in Sierra Leone, and formal work is restricted to the few most highly educated workers’ \(2016, p. 65\). In a working\-age population of slightly more than 3 million people, 62% are employed informally, with fewer than 10 percent in wage employment \(p. xiv\). The informal sector is estimated at around 2.7 million people. 

 The first stage of the research took place between 2011 and 2016, with Dr Alice Mesnard \(City, University of London\) and former PhD student, Joseph Kamara. \[3.3\] They developed a survey to elicit the WTP for improvements in healthcare from individuals in the informal sector, using a Discrete Choice Model approach. Eight informal sector activities were selected: petty trading, subsistence farming, commercial bike riding, cattle rearing, fishing, tailoring, mining, and quarrying. A random effect logit model was used to estimate households’ WTP for an improvement in coverage, choice of health care provider, and a reduction in waiting time. The study revealed that households were WTP more to have better attributes \(better coverage, less waiting time\) and to go to a faith\-based provider. The findings also suggest that location mattered in determining the WTP, with urban households WTP more for health insurance than their rural counterparts at Sierra Leone Leones \(SLL\) 54,348 \(USD7.34\) and SLL 37,250.5 \(USD5.03\), respectively. \[3.3\] 

 **\(ii\) WTP for Health Insurance in the Informal Sector in Sierra Leone** 

1.  Subsequently, in 2016, Jofre\-Bonet was commissioned by the government in Sierra Leone and used a very large \(10,000obs\) tailored survey to elicit the WTP for health insurance \(HI\) of individuals in the informal sector in Sierra Leone. \[3.4\] The survey used a Double\-Bounded Dichotomous Choice with Follow Up contingent valuation method, an approach chosen because it has been shown to yield more accurate WTP estimates than the alternative single\-bounded method. **89% of respondents said they would pay for health insurance to avoid expensive pay\-as\-you\-go healthcare.** The article examines the individual factors associated with the likelihood of joining the HI scheme at a variety of premium levels. The analysis showed that a premium could be set at approximately SLL 20,000 SLL \(USD3.54\) per month but noted that setting a single premium too high would jeopardise the participation of certain groups, impacting the financial risk\-pooling mechanism. Jofre\-Bonet’s work challenged pre\-conceptions on feasible premium fees for healthcare coverage compared to what the informal sector was already paying out\-of\-pocket for medical care. Discussions with Professor Jofre\-Bonet around the optimal premium underpinned the government’s policy decision to set the joining price of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme at SLL 15,000 when it rolled out in 2018.

 Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s research and her extensive engagement with the Government of Sierra Leone resulted in a transformation of healthcare policy and practice with the introduction of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme. Through establishing willingness to pay \(WTP\) for Health Insurance \(HI\) in the Informal Sector, her work has had a significant impact on the provision of support for poor and vulnerable populations, improving the lives of an estimated 2.7 million workers who did not previously have access to affordable healthcare in this post\-conflict Low Income country **.** 

 **\(i\) Influencing the development of a national Health Insurance scheme** 

 In 2016, introducing a national Health Insurance scheme became a priority not only for the government in power – the All People’s Congress \(APC\) – but also for major donors such as the World Bank and the then UK Department for International Development. Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s initial research with Dr Joseph Kamara \[3.3\] led to her being commissioned by the National Social Security and Insurance Trust \(NASSIT\) of Sierra Leone to carry out an extensive study to elicit the WTP of the informal sector. The significance of this work was confirmed by the Director General of NASSIT, a senior civil servant: 

 “Two key academic documents helped to shape the idea of a National Health Insurance Scheme in Sierra Leone. First, the paper “A Discrete Choice Experiment to Elicit the Willingness to Pay for Health Insurance by the Informal Sector Workers in Sierra Leone” \[3.3\]… justified the practical need from the largest workforce in the country – the Informal Sector – to have a national health insurance scheme… The second and main paper \[was the\] ‘Willingness to Pay for Health Insurance among Informal Sector Workers in Sierra Leone’ \[3.4\].” \[5.1\] 

 As lead consultant of the study, Professor Jofre\-Bonet met with representatives of the World Health Organization \(WHO\) in Sierra Leone in October 2016 to discuss the results of the research and the obstacles to the implementation of the HI scheme. \[5.1\] Later that month, she presented the initial report to the Minister of Labour and Social Security and his team; health development partners working in Sierra Leone \(WHO, World Bank\); the private sector; and other government representatives, who were developing Sierra Leone’s HI scheme. 

 Afterwards, Professor Jofre\-Bonet held private talks on to the implications of the research and the feasibility of the implementation of the HI scheme with the Minister of Labour and Social Security; the Director General of the National Social Security and Insurance Trust; and the WHO country representative. \[5.1, 5.2\] Discussions with these stakeholders facilitated a better understanding of the barriers to the implementation of the HI scheme, including the characteristics of the healthcare provision up to that point; the persistent lack of funding for medical staff, and the recent reduction in their numbers due to the Ebola crisis. The commissioned study \[3.4\] helped to determine how much informal sector individuals were willing and able to pay and the frequency of payment. It also helped to increase the level of acceptance of the HI scheme among beneficiaries and increased the desire and willingness from Government and other partners to implement the scheme. \[5.3, 00.01.49\] 

 **\(ii\) Shaping the Sierra Leone Health Insurance Act of 2017** 

 A combination of the WTP survey results and insights from discussions with Professor Jofre\-Bonet helped the technical team and, subsequently, the Government of Sierra Leone to make an evidence\-based decision to go ahead with their plans for the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance \(SLeSHI\) scheme. This is confirmed by the Director General of NASSIT, who writes that Professor Jofre\-Bonet’s work: 

 “… was also subsequently used as the base for the preparation of the Social Health Insurance Policy for Sierra Leone and thereafter the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance Act of 2017.” \[5.1\] 

 The SLeSHI budget of around SLL 18.19 billion, on top of SLL 4.16 billion already invested, was approved in May 2017 \[5.4, p. 1\] and the policy gained Cabinet Approval in November 2017. \[5.5\] This laid the foundation for the SLeSHI Bill that was debated, approved, and ratified in Parliament in December 2017 leading to the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance Act of 2017. \[5.6\] Integrated implementation plans for the scheme are documented in key reports produced by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation, including the National Health Sector Strategic Plan 2017\-21 \[5.7a, e.g. p. 55\] and the **National Nursing and Midwifery Strategic Plan 2019\-2023.** \[5.7b, e.g. p. 36\] 

 **\(iii\) Implementation and Evaluation of the SLeSHI Scheme** 

 Returning to Sierra Leone after his studies,  [Dr Kamara](http://slconcordtimes.com/parliament-okays-sleshi-coordinator-says-its-one-of-the-best-laws-in-sierra-leone/) played a key role in setting up these far\-reaching changes as the National Co\-ordinator of the SLeSHI Scheme, which was  [launched by President Ernest Bai Koroma](http://slconcordtimes.com/president-koroma-launches-social-health-insurance-scheme/) on 16 February 2018 at a well\-attended ceremony in Freetown. \[5.3, 00.02.47\] Following the change of government in April 2018, President Julius Maada Bio of the Sierra Leone People’s Party \(SLPP\) committed to the implementation and extension of the SLeSHI Scheme. \[5.8, p.41\] 

 The government’s 2019 Midterm Review Report for the United Nations Human Rights Council \(UNHRC\) confirmed the extension of the scheme to the Informal Sector: 

 “112. In December 2017, the Parliament of Sierra Leone approved the introduction of the Sierra Leone Social Health Insurance Scheme \(SLeSHI\). This schemeis administered by NASSIT. NASSIT intends to extend the social security protection to the Informal Sector.” \[5.9, p.27\] 

 The SLeSHI Scheme is also a fundamental element of Sierra Leone’s Universal Health Coverage \(UHC\) plan which means all Sierra Leoneans will receive the health services they need without suffering financial hardship. \[5.10\] The UHC Partnership – which includes organisations such as the WHO and UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office – has more recently “shifted its support towards the development, implementation and monitoring of the National Health Sector Strategic Plan 2017\-2021 as well as the establishment of Sierra Leone’s Social Health Insurance scheme”. \[5.10\] 

 The SLeSHI financial risk\-pooling mechanism which is now in place sets out to “ensure the cross\-subsidization between the rich and the poor and also ensure the healthy cross\-subsidize the sick” \[5.5, p.20\].  The changes mean all workers in the informal sector are required by law to join the scheme and to pay an equivalent flat rate of $2 USD a month to access a health insurance scheme for primary care. \[5.5, p.24\] Those in the formal sector will pay 6% of their salaries into the scheme ‘at source’. The government will also pay a contribution: 

 “Government of Sierra Leone shall provide subsidy to the SLeSHI Fund to match up the fiscal gap that will be created mainly due to the inclusion of the exempted groups \(all children below 12 years, all pregnant women, all lactating mothers, the disabled, senior citizens above 65 years and indigents\) and the meagre amount that is been paid by the Informal Sector."" \[5.5, p.25\] 

 The full roll out of the scheme has been delayed due to the Covic\-19 pandemic but realising the benefits of improved health outcomes in the working population to Sierra Leone’s economic and social development remains a political priority. President Bio said in January 2021: “We are following through on our promise in the New Direction Manifesto \[5.8\] and The Medium\-Term National Development Plan to increase affordable access to quality healthcare service delivery. That goal also aligns with a central plank of our human capital development priorities \- access to quality healthcare \- and the Sustainable Development Goal 3 on delivering good health and well\-being to our citizens”. \[5.11, p. 2\] The SLeSHI health insurance scheme will enhance the health and quality of life of the estimated 2.7 million people in the informal sector in Sierra Leone by improving access to affordable healthcare.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 A new class of thermoset moisture\-curing solvent\-free pressure\-sensitive adhesives \(PSAs\) has been developed for innovative applications in transdermal drug delivery. Innovation is demonstrated in several areas: solubilisation of pharmaceuticals as their native free acids or bases \(rather than their salts\) giving significantly higher drug loadings and more efficient systemic delivery than for conventional PSAs; enhanced hydrogen\-bonding in the urea based adhesives improving adhesion, even with perspiration and bathing. The 3D network removes disadvantages arising from cold flow \(whereby the adhesive flows undesirably outside of the area of the backing on wear\). The spin\-out company Medherant Ltd was established by Professor David Haddleton to exploit this disruptive technology giving an efficient route to the clinic for drug\-delivery devices for applications including pain relief, smoking cessation and treatment of central nervous system disorders, such as Alzheimer’s, supported by multiple funded feasibility studies in partnership with global pharmaceutical companies. Medherant has to date received GBP11,400,000 investment, presently employs 16 staff and has successfully taken a non\-steroidal anti\-inflammatory drug patch through Phase 1 clinical trials. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Haddleton has over 25 years’ experience of fundamental chemistry, development and commercialisation of pressure sensitive adhesives in medical applications.  This includes \(i\) successful commercialisation of hydrogel based PSA ECG and defibrillation electrodes; \(ii\) development of hydrogel PSA sweat collection skin\-adhering devices with Unilever for use in personal care applications **\[3.1\]**; and \(iii\) development of hydrogel antibacterial wound dressings, to combat *so\-called* super\-bugs **\[3.2\]**. Based on this extensive experience, in 2014 Haddleton realised the potential of a family of moisture\-curable poly\(ether urethane/urea silicone\) PSAs for use in transdermal drug delivery. These PSAs offered several benefits over existing materials: \(i\) their composition allows for higher loadings and higher transdermal diffusion rates, increasing the systemic flux leading to reduced patch sizes; \(ii\) removal of solvents from the manufacturing process; and \(iii\) eliminating undesirable cold flow. 

 This family of urethane PSA’s was initially in\-licensed with an exclusive global licence from Bostik, for use in medical applications and transdermal delivery; this license was secured partly by Bostik’s confidence in Haddleton’s track record in the commercialisation of medical adhesives. Professor Haddleton and colleagues at UoW carried out a number of drug diffusion experiments with drug excipients designed to increase transdermal efficiency. The favourable data from the experiments led to the rapid formation of Medherant Ltd. Medherant was immediately located in bespoke purpose\-built laboratories on the University of Warwick Science Park to ensure the most efficient route to maximum impact, under the continued scientific supervision and direction of Haddleton. Rapid initial funding was secured from an established venture capital trust \(VCT\), Mercia Technologies Plc., who have continued to support Medherant via both VCT \(Enterprise Investment Scheme\) and balance\-sheet funding. 

 Haddleton has subsequently invented a range of novel PSAs with improved manufacturing and use advantages over the original in\-licensed materials **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]**: including use of renewable polycarbonate polyols **\[3.6\]**, radiation\-cure manufacturing **\[3.7\]** and development of a new polyurea\-based adhesive where hydrogen\-bonding properties remove the requirement for added ‘tackifying resins’ – achieving superior adhesion in a cleaner, simpler process **\[3.8\]**. All recent products \(post 2019\) use this new class of polyurea\-based PSAs. These new inventions from Haddleton have led to in\-house manufacturing, previously carried out in France, of these proprietary PSAs which have now entered the supply chain under appropriate quality control measures supplied from Medherant directly to the Good Manufacturing Practice \(GMP\) manufacturing partner for clinical materials production.  All pre\-clinical manufacturing of both PSA and finished patch is now based in Medherant’s facility in Coventry, since mid\-2020. 

  

 The new PSAs incorporate active pharmaceutical ingredients \(APIs\) as both free bases and acids \(rather than salts\), allowing for higher drug loadings than market alternatives leading to increased systemic flux rates and flux duration allowing for patch application for up to 7 days \(important in applications such as Alzheimer’s\). These patches release higher total amounts of API due to reduced interactions between API and PSA as often adhesives used in transdermal applications are charged e.g. contain acids which form salts with the APIs – important in combating drug abuse from used recycled patches \(e.g. opioids/Fentanyl\). Out of \~40 drugs currently delivered in transdermal patches/topical gels, and an additional \~50 drugs currently administered orally, >75% have been found to be suitable for transdermal delivery using the new PSAs. Around 50% of the drugs that are currently used in topical/transdermal creams are not currently available in patches; mainly as no one has solved how to dissolve them in current commercial adhesives to give the required flux across the skin. Haddleton showed that the majority of these drugs do dissolve in the new adhesives, making them suitable for transdermal delivery. Data has been collected using a patented high\-throughput diffusion testing instrument designed by Haddleton and constructed in the Department of Chemistry at Warwick **\[3.9\].** 

 The new patches have been shown to be comfortable to wear, leave no residues, are removed easily and can stay adhered for multiple days, withstanding normal day to day activities. These adhesives out\-perform many commercially available products in terms of adhesion, API flux, comfort and cold flow. The underpinning research showed that patches can be loaded with up to 30% \(w/w\) of some API’s \(e.g. Lidocaine\) with little reduction in skin adhesion; even at 30% drug loading, adhesion can be up to 100x better than current commercial transdermal patches **\[3.5\].** 

  

 Haddleton serves as Chief Scientific Officer of Medherant, and as a Board director: he has overseen production, scientific and technical teams in Medherant throughout the period.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Medherant Ltd was founded in 2014 to facilitate commercialisation of new drug\-delivery technology based on PSA drug\-delivery patches developed at Warwick **\[5.1\]**. The global Transdermal Drug Delivery \(TDD\) system market was worth >USD30,000,000,000 in 2015 and is projected to double by 2024. It is driven by the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, where conventional drug delivery systems have lower potency due to hepatic first\-pass metabolism. A significant contributor to market growth is the increasing inclination of both patients and physicians towards pain\-free effective drug delivery whilst maintaining constant drug concentrations within their therapeutic window. 

 Medherant has received GBP11,400,000 investment to date, enabling two successful European Phase 1 clinical trials in August 2018 **\[5.2\]** when the company's projected value was GBP15,000,000. Medherant has generated employment for between 15\-20 people since 2015, and currently employs 16 staff with approximately half of these scientists **\[5.2\]**. Recognition of Medherant is seen through winning the Coventry Telegraph's *Excellence in Science and Technology Award,* 2017, being listed in The Times *Best Places to do Business*, 2020 **\[5.3\]** and receiving widespread media coverage in the national and international press **\[5.4\]**. 

 The company has developed a business model whereby it develops its own products which it takes through clinical trials, requiring significant medium\-term investment for investor return on a 5\-10\-year time scale, and partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to develop products on a fee\-for\-service model for short\-term and long\-term income generation, including future royalty payments. Medherant expects a flotation/trade sale of >GBP100,000,000 by Q4 2021/Q1 2022, with a further Series A investment planned in 2021 for >GBP5,000,000, to move the company to Phase 3 clinical trials readiness. The CEO of Mercia Technologies Plc, an AIM\-listed investment group which has invested GBP7,700,000 in Medherant since 2015, states that it is the *“versatility, breadth of technology and leading wisdom in adhesive polymer chemistry that supports our continued belief in the medium to long term potential of the business. Within Mercia’s proprietary portfolio of circa 20 investments, as of 31 March 2020, Medherant was by value the fourth largest holding overall and second within its Life Sciences portfolio.”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Medherant was awarded an Innovate UK 'Medicines in Manufacturing' grant in October 2018 **\[5.6\]**. It designed and installed its own patch manufacturing facility in Coventry in 2018, and successfully produces non\-GMP and pre\-clinical patches under its own quality control management being supplied directly to GMP FDA\-approved manufacturing facilities at Adhex Pharma in Dijon, France.  A proprietary patent\-protected high\-throughput permeation assessment process rapidly identifies formulations to meet target drug release profiles, enabling the development of candidate patch formulations for companies in approx. 2\-3 months **\[3.9\]**. Medherant has also produced its proprietary TEPI® TDD patches for third parties interested in assessing the suitability of the TEPI® technology for their own drugs. The Innovate UK grant **\[5.6\]** allowed Medherant to successfully extend its pilot scale and non\-GMP manufacture and early\-stage commercial manufacture throughout 2019 and 2020. 

 **Engagement with Pharmaceutical Companies:** 

 As of December 2020, Medherant has undertaken multiple feasibility studies generating GBP590,000 in revenue with global pharmaceutical companies; \[text removed for publication\] and Cycle Pharmaceuticals **\[5.2\]**. \[text removed for publication\]. In May 2020, Cycle Pharmaceuticals signed an agreement worth \[text removed for publication\] with Medherant to develop and commercialise multiple products using the TEPI Patch® technology with the aim of delivering best\-in\-class drug treatments for rare metabolic and neurological genetic conditions, which are under\-served diseases in the patient community **\[5.7\]**. \[text removed for publication\] **\[5.7\]**. 

 In Q4 2020 Medherant began discussions with \[text removed for publication\] about potential licensing of its in\-house developed diclofenac product for treatment of arthritis. In addition, Medherant has been engaged with \[text removed for publication\] for pain relief, \[text removed for publication\] for central nervous system products, dementia and smoking cessation, \[text removed for publication\] for further pain relief patches for distribution in France, Germany, Belgium and The Netherlands markets, \[text removed for publication\] for pain relief. Medherant has a marketing deal with a leading UK supplier of cannabidiol \(CBD\) products who will be marketing Medherant\-Coventry manufactured CBD patches for health and well\-being in Q2 2021, initially available online with subsequent release in major UK retail outlets, including leading supermarkets. 

 **Indicative Sales Projections:** 

 *Smoking cessation patches* \- Varenicline tablets \(Pfizer\) for smoking cessation currently generate USD1,100,000,000 revenue \(Pfizer’s 8<sup>th</sup> largest revenue generating drug\) and will be off patent in 2021/2022. The global market for smoking cessation products is expected to reach USD64,000,000,000 in 2026 growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 16.9% during 2018\-2026 \(Businesswire, 2020\) due to the expansion of Medicare in the US. Smoking remains the single largest preventable cause of death and disease in the US \(\~5,000,000 deaths/year\): Varenicline is the most effective way to reduce and eliminate smoking and this has given Medherant confidence to progress Varenicline TDD patches in Canadian/US clinical trials in Q1 2021 with a USD800,000 contract with AltaBiosciences in place. Medherant has chosen the US for product launch due to the size of the market, the wide acceptance of Varenicline, and the attractive revenue which will allow for continued growth and removal of reliance on investment funding.  IPO market research with US\-based physicians shows that 60% anticipate the need for a patch to be high and Medherant can expect 40% market share. This will be the first patch to market and is the basis for the planned flotation in late 2021, with revenues forecast to exceed USD300,000,000 per year **\[5.2\].** 

  

 *Pain relief patches* – In the UK pricing ranges from GBP2/patch \(Salonpas\) to GBP18/patch \(CBD\), with Voltarol and Ibuprofen patches costing *ca* GBP5/patch. The manufacturing cost of one patch is approximately 5p. There is currently no topical Ibuprofen formulation available in the USA \(it is not yet FDA\-approved\) and Medherant is currently arranging an auction for the rights to their Ibuprofen patch in the US. The market for Lidocaine local anaesthetic patches, in the USA is valued at approximately GBP2,000,000,000 per annum with Lidocaine now being allowed over the counter as well as via prescription. Medherant have developed a superior Lidocaine patch with a potentially simple route through US clinical trials, which is currently being evaluated by \[text removed for publication\]. Medherant is also developing cannabinoid delivery patches \(both CBD and THC \(tetrahydrocannabinol\) in regions where cannabinoid use is now legalised for a range of medical uses. 

 **Impacts arising from patch use:** 

 Patches result in improved healthcare outcomes and better quality of life for users globally. The delivery of NSAIDs \(non\-steroidal anti\-inflammatory drugs\) transdermally, as opposed to orally, is expected to reduce the number of patients suffering from gastrointestinal \(GI\) damage which can be caused by prolonged oral dosage of NSAIDs. Patches lead to improved drug delivery for the easier treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's/dementia. The Medherant 7\-day patch under development using the polyurea\-based adhesives will allow carers to administer a weekly patch for patients, as indicated by the market research from prescribing doctors in the US and the UK.

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Research from the strategic partnership between Procter and Gamble \(P&G\) and Durham Chemistry has "" *enabled unique and globally scalable innovation that has improved billions of consumers' lives around the world""*. We describe direct impact via consumer goods innovation of **\[REDACTED\]**, research savings to P&G of **\[REDACTED\]**, support/creation of \~150 jobs in the North East, and inward investment from the USA of **\[REDACTED\]**. P&G's preferred platform for skin testing new consumer products is now Durham's Alvetex<sup>®</sup> 3D cell culture technology. Alvetex<sup>®</sup>, marketed by ReproCell, has had **\[REDACTED\]**sales in period. Outreach activities impacting >6500 members of the public and featured on the BBC show ""Inside Out"" have arisen from the research. 
","
### 1.  Underpinning research 

 In 2010 Durham Sciences started to explore new ways of working strategically with industry to help build research impact. We chose to work with P&G, motivated by the fact that they are a global innovation\-led company giving us the potential to impact their 5 billion worldwide customers. In the early relationship stages we shared research expertise \(including \[R1, 2, 3\]\) and ambitions to confirm that a strategic relationship would be of genuine benefit to both sides and to define early research projects building from Durham University \(DU\) Chemistry research. At the outset we adopted a ""master agreement"" covering all IP, exploitation and confidentiality aspects. This has meant that subsequent research programmes can be launched with minimal ""activation barriers"". 

 We have collaborated in diverse chemistry research areas including photobleaches, soil\-surfactant interactions, surface\-active polymers and molecules, enzyme stability, chelant design, anti\-microbials, small molecular migration by experiment and theory, optical brighteners and hueing dyes, phase diagram prediction and lipid delivery systems. 

 We have also co\-created a number of larger more collaborative projects involving Physics, Life Sciences, Computer Sciences and the Business School. Since 2010 the research grant portfolio has totalled around GBP23.6m \(GBP7.6m/GBP11.5m/GBP4.5m industry/UK or EU government/University\) and has involved around 70 University \(25 Chemistry\) academics and 50 industry researchers \(across P&G sites in the United Kingdom \(UK\), United States of America \(USA\), Germany, Brussels and Singapore\) working with 36 PDRAs and 44 PhD students. The research has been underpinned by several competitively won large grants including: CEMENT \(GBP14m Regional Growth Fund project\); MICSED \(EU ITN GBP1m to Durham\); and Molecular Migration \(EPSRC GBP1m/industry GBP2m, Durham, Sheffield and Birmingham Universities with P&G, Mondelēz and Akzo\). 

 We summarise below specific DU Chemistry research in soft matter, analytical, coordination and polymer chemistry that has led to the impacts described in Section 4. 

 Surface chemistry & characterisation: Prof. Colin Bain developed ellipsometry and Total Internal Reflectance \(TIR\) Raman Spectroscopy for measuring the absorption rates and quantity of surface\-active species at solid\-liquid interfaces \(e.g. \[R3\] and GR/S15778\). TIR\-Raman spectroscopy offers 1\-s time resolution and sub\-monolayer sensitivity; Bain’s invention has been replicated by labs in Europe, Australia and the USA. These methods were re\-applied in contract research funded by P&G to measure the uptake of new polymer additives on model surfaces in order to elucidate their mode of action in laundry applications. Bain also has long\-term research interests in the properties of liquid jets and in flow and deposition on surfaces \(e.g. \[R4\] and grants EP/E019323, N025245, H018913\). The techniques and knowledge developed in these programmes were applied to the impact of jets on thin films of dishwasher formulations created with a slot\-die coater, in further research funded by P&G. 

 Synthetic chemistry: Several of Durham's synthetic chemists have collaborated with P&G. Prof. Jon Steed's expertise in ligand design, coordination chemistry and crystallisation \(e.g. EPSRC R013373\) has been applied to the design of novel two\-component CaCO3 crystallisation inhibitors for dishwashing applications. The work involved inhibitor design, structure function studies of inhibitor–metal interactions, combinatorial studies of efficacy, and development of rapid deposition test apparatus and is described in publication \[R5\] and a related patent \[EP3456808A1\]. 

 3D cell growth and skin models: P&G have adopted DU’s novel skin test models as their preferred product development platform. The models derive from collaborative research between Cameron, Cooper and Przyborski \(Durham Biosciences\) that used emulsion templating to produce porous polystyrene materials \[R1\] that were developed into 3D cell culture scaffolds under EPSRC grant GR/T24043 and described in \(e.g.\) \[R2\]. Materials were subsequently optimised to produce thin membranes, tested for cell growth and the technology optimised for scale up and reproducibility. The product was commercialised as Alvetex®, and its early impact was described in a Chemistry REF2014 case. 

 Imaging and spectroscopy: Prof. Andrew Beeby's research interests lie in the area of photochemistry, time\-resolved spectroscopy and imaging. Research methods in \[R6\] have been applied to study pigments in ancient manuscripts held in libraries across the UK, feeding an active outreach program. The same techniques have been applied to P&G product imaging challenges and transferred to P&G through purpose\-built spectrometers that now form an integral part of their research testing portfolio.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Laundry formulations:** Controlled polymer deposition onto different fabrics underpins the stain release properties of many laundry detergents. This improves efficacy, particularly at environmentally friendly low wash temperatures. In two collaborative projects with P&G scientists Dr Andrew Graydon and Dr Anju Booker, Prof. Bain used ellipsometry and TIR\-Raman scattering \(method in \[R3\]\) to measure the adsorption of polymeric laundry additives onto mimics of synthetic fabrics and the effect of these additives on the adsorption of proteins and complex polysaccharides. The learning led to the introduction of new patented polymer technologies into single unit dose formulations \(Ariel pods\), a business with an estimated global value of **\[REDACTED\]**pa; in the attached evidence document \[E1\], P&G estimate the direct impact of this DU research as **\[REDACTED\]**. The insight gained into the lack of surface adsorption of some candidate molecules also shut down an industry\-based research project which could not have succeeded twelve months ahead of schedule with an estimated saving of **\[REDACTED\]** \[E1\]. 

 **Cleaning and deposition in dishwashers:** Automatic dishwashing is a **\[REDACTED\]** global business. The need for higher efficiency at lower washing temperatures to help reduce energy consumption drives continuous testing and product innovation in formulations and additives. Prof Bain's expertise in the properties of water jets, droplet splashing, spreading and flow on surfaces \(e.g. \[R4\]\) was used in two research projects with P&G scientists: Dr Nathalie Letzhelter and Dr Rachel Martin to help understand the dishwashing process. This has led to significant down\-scaling of P&G test methods and the development of automated test rigs that reduce the testing time for new materials by a factor of five and allowed direct visualisation of the wash process providing an estimated **\[REDACTED\]** pa saving \[E1\]. P&G state that four new \(confidential\) technologies have been delivered to market that were qualified by the new methods. Total product sales are estimated at **\[REDACTED\]**and P&G have filed multiple patents in the area \[E1\]. Maximising ""shine"" by controlling deposition of CaCO<sub>3</sub> and other soils is a second key consideration during dish washing. Work under the *CEMENT* project led to new combination additives \[R5\] \(and patent EP3456808A1, *Automatic dishwashing cleaning composition*\) and delivered a new experimental rig to P&G for quantifying soil build up. This has reduced formulation testing times from \~2 weeks to 1 day with consequent R&D savings of **\[REDACTED\]**pa \[E1\]. The scientific learnings continue to impact next\-generation formulations. 

 **Skin Models:** DU Chemistry research into porous polymer scaffolds \[R1, 2\] created products for 3D cell growth which formed part of a Chemistry REF2014 impact case. The technology has since been bought by the Japanese Company Reprocell and is being sold as the Alvetex<sup>®</sup> range \[E3\]. Manufacture and supply of Alvetex<sup>®</sup> are led by Reprocell Europe within the UK at sites in Sedgefield and Glasgow. Sales in period are **\[REDACTED\]** \[E4\]. P&G, Reprocell and Durham University have entered a partnership for the full commercialisation of a novel model of human full thickness skin developed on the Alvetex<sup>®</sup> platform \[E4\]. This partnership enabled the technology\-transfer to ReproCell, ensuring its on\-going development. Alvetex<sup>®</sup> was selected by P&G as its preferred platform for robust and reproducible human skin models and they have invested ca **\[REDACTED\]** in Alvetex\-reliant projects. 



 *Fig1: \(Clockwise\) P&G products impacted, new shine ADW test rig and additives, Alvetex<sup>®</sup> polymers, a P&G/Durham PhD\-student “imaging the gospels’’ and part of the dishwasher test system* 

 **Societal and other impacts:** While harder to quantify, multiple additional impacts have arisen from the partnership: 

-  **North East jobs:** Our Regional Growth Fund project *CEMENT* \(2011–2016\) created \+ secured 83\+195=278 FTE\-years \(38\+91=129 in REF period\) in the NE economy within P&G and partner companies such as Peerless Systems \[E5\]; many of the positions have continued beyond the 2016 formal reporting cut\-off. The total salary in\-period is \~GBP3.2m. Our *CEMENT* collaboration enabled Peerless to develop then deliver four NE\-built 30\-pot automated washing systems to P&G sites \(total cost GBP1.2m\) which has revolutionised formulation testing protocols, saving P&G around **\[REDACTED\]** pa per instrument in terms of manpower, water and energy \[E6\]. 

-  **Policy:** Jeff Weedman \(Global Business Development VP at P&G\) spoke to US Governors in Washington in 2012 to influence US policy around entrepreneurship. He highlighted how UK universities \(citing Durham in particular\) were ""more competitive, more aggressive, more forward looking, more business friendly"" and better set up for interdisciplinary research \[E7\]. This thinking has helped secure significant subsequent US investment in UK innovation centres in the REF period, which P&G estimate has secured >20 FTE research jobs in the UK \[E1\]. Durham has received US inward investment of **\[REDACTED\]** into research in the period. EPSRC highlighted the partnership in a 2015 case study document \[E7\]. 

-  **Anti\-counterfeit and other devices:** Prof Beeby’s spectroscopy expertise \[R6\] has enabled development of hand\-held hyperspectral imaging cameras capable of in\-field counterfeit package detection. This has developed into image recognition projects based in computer sciences valued at **\[REDACTED\].** Scanning imaging short wave infrared \(SWIR\) spectrometers developed at Durham have now being replicated and used in P&G labs \(GBP35k ea.\) for in\-house analysis of garment soil malodour sources, and hand\-held devices destined for customer demonstrations of garment cleaning are under development. 

-  **Outreach spectroscopy and policy:** Soft\-matter related outreach activities have reached \~6500 members of the public pa in period via events at Durham Science Festival and Schools Science week staffed by P&G and Durham researchers \[E8\]. Beeby developed spectroscopic imaging methods to tackle P&G research challenges which have been reapplied in his research with historians \[R6\]. These have changed UK national policy around acceptable methods of artefact imaging in heritage science \[E8\]. Associated outreach work on ""Imaging the Gospels""; featured on the 9/3/2020 BBC1 Inside/Out show filmed in Durham Chemistry \[E8\] and has been disseminated in over 20 lectures to groups including the Royal Society, Royal Academy, history groups and libraries. 

 We summarise with a quote from a P&G Senior Director \[E1\]: "" *...the innovation partnership that Durham has established with P&G has enabled unique and globally scalable innovation that have improved billions of consumers' lives around the world directly supporting the economic, societal and health benefits that our product range enable*"".

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research at Sunderland created the first detailed, large\-scale, evidence\-based picture of the physical and technical demands of elite football; specifically how these demands evolved over time and vary between matches. The research changed the intellectual zeitgeist on demands in football and the findings have become the accepted benchmark for elite football internationally, forming the basis of tailored investigation within clubs, national sides, and governing bodies including FIFA and UEFA. The work has given coaches, sports scientists and medical staff at topflight teams, including FC Barcelona and Liverpool FC, solid evidence on which to base their scouting activity, training and player preparation to improve performance and reduce injury, and has permeated thinking in elite sport more widely. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Researchers at the University of Sunderland have studied the technical and physical demands of elite sport \(in particular football\), the factors that affect them and their evolution over time. 

 It began in 2009 with the first large scale study of the patterns of high\-intensity running in the English Premier League \(EPL\), breaking down the analysis per position **\[R1\]**. In 2011, the team carried out the first study comparing how the physical and technical demands on elite players changed with different team formations \(e.g. 4\-4\-2 with 4\-5\-1\) **\[R2\]**. 

 They then undertook a large\-scale longitudinal analysis of data covering every player in every game of the EPL over 7 seasons \(2006/7 to 2012/13\), totalling some 20,000 player incidents. The dataset came from ProZone, a semi\-automated player tracking system that uses a multiple camera set\-up to automatically track individual player movements in combination with human operators. Specific technical elements \(passes, tackles, etc.\) were then tagged. This study \(funded by Sunderland FC\) looked at two aspects: first, the physical demands of match play on players, demonstrating conclusively for the first time the rapid evolution of the high\-intensity aspects across all players over seven seasons \(30\-35% increase\) **\[R3\]**; and second, the increasing technical demands on players with dramatic increases in both the number \(40% increase\) and successful percentage of passes \(76% to 84%\). In addition, the nature of these demands changed with a greater proportion of explosive sprints \(short bursts of running with high acceleration that carry particular risk of injury\) and a greater proportion of short range \(rather than long range\) passes **\[R3\]**. 

 This seminal study was followed by three further studies at Sunderland using the same data set. The first examined how these remarkable changes differed between playing position, finding that the physical demands increased to the greatest extent in players in wide and attacking positions, whereas the technical demands increased most in central defenders and midfield players **\[R4\]**. This enabled practitioners to develop tailored position\-specific conditioning exercises. The EPL is highly competitive with clubs with a large variability in sporting success, club income and player nationalities. A second study examined whether the evolution observed was similar across teams finishing in differing positions. This research found that the changes were not evenly distributed across all EPL teams, and that the second ‘tier’ of teams \(i.e. those positioned 5<sup>th</sup>\-8<sup>th</sup> within the EPL\) experienced more significant change than other teams **\[R5\]**. A related study investigated the evolution of UK and non\-UK players, finding small differences in the initial year which disappeared over the seven years analysed **\[R6\]**. A separate dataset explored the within\-player match\-to\-match variability within the physical and tactical parameters of the EPL **\[R7\]**. This was the first paper to quantify technical variability and was important in establishing what constituted natural variation in key technical aspects of the game and what clubs should treat as a significant deviation from the norm.

 This large\-scale, detailed and evidence\-based picture of the evolution of the modern game in terms of physical and technical demands on players is unprecedented. The massive sample size ensured that results were as conclusive as they were dramatic; the magnitude of change recorded over 7 EPL seasons was similar to the change seen in over 42 years of FIFA World Cup finals. As a result, the findings have become a key benchmark and reference for performance management and player preparation across elite football. The work changed the zeitgeist in football research, triggering a huge change in the thinking of practitioners at clubs and impacting the whole body of sport science in football. 

 **R3** and **R4** generated considerable interest across the international elite football community, with the authors presenting at sports science practitioner conferences around the world. The papers quickly began to receive citations as interest multiplied. Clubs and sports associations launched their own studies inspired by the findings. Overall, the research has been cited in studies **\[S1\]** conducted by \(or in partnership with\) **64 football clubs worldwide**, including **13 Champions League teams** \(of which 2 winners and 2 runners up\) and **15 EPL teams**, and 6 of the top 30 clubs worldwide by trophies won. It has been cited by the **English Football Association \(The FA\)** and **9 other national football federations** from five continents. Its influence extends beyond soccer to **4 national Olympic and Paralympic Committees**, as well as national Sport Institutes and associations in hockey, cycling, rugby, tennis and archery. Its impact transcends football codes, and is cited in research by **2 NFL \(American football\) and 4 Australian Rules** football teams **\[S1\]** and Gaelic sports teams. Of these studies, Sunderland findings have contributed particularly significantly to the key methodology, dataset or underpinning principles of research **\[S1\]** by Manchester United, Arsenal, Newcastle United, Paris St Germain, Everton, Lille, Red Bull Brazil, Coventry City, Southampton, Ipswich Town, Fleetwood Town, and Rochdale Town, Barcelona **\[S2\]**, Liverpool **\[S3\]** and Brighton & Hove Albion **\[S4\]**. 

 **FIFA** employed **Bradley** as consultant to conduct tailored studies inspired by the research. His physical analysis of the FIFA Women’s World Cup 2019 **\[S5\]** is based entirely on the data gathering methodology developed and validated at Sunderland **\[R1\]**. As renowned manager Arsene Wenger explains in his introduction to the report, “ *information is key to professionalise the sport even further. Only by making the most of data can we work effectively and sustainably on the development of the women’s game and take it forward – whether through a tailor\-made talent development approach or through targeted coach education. The insights gained can also be harnessed to optimise players’ preparations and thus their performance. The third edition of the physical analysis is an important building block to improve and reach our goal*” **\[S5\]**. The report used analysis of every match and team at the tournament to identify trends and make practical recommendations for corresponding changes to training **\[S5\]**. 

 **UEFA’s** expert group used the findings around the evolving demands on players as part of the justification for the update to their Consensus Statement on Nutrition in Elite Football published in 2020 \(their first on the subject since 2010\) and presented to sports professionals at the International Sports & Exercise Nutrition Conference. As detailed in the executive summary: “ *The rapid evolution of the game itself, in addition to changes in our understanding of sports nutrition, has created uncertainty as to the appropriate nutritional decisions to make at specific moments in time and in specific contexts*” **\[S6\]**. 

 Injury has a significant impact on clubs’ finances, with the estimated cost of a first team player injury being around €500,000 per month. **UEFA** use the team’s research in their work to address and prevent injury **\[S7\]**, drawing on **R3** to understand previously unexplained changes in hamstring injury rates. They likewise use **R3** to demonstrate the importance of the UEFA Elite Club Injury Study \(their injury monitoring process applied to elite leagues across Europe\), saying “ *Football has changed a great deal since ECIS was launched; there are more games per calendar year and objective data show that the players run farther than they used to, with more frequent high\-speed efforts”* **\[S8\]**. 

 As well as its impact on clubs’ and organisations’ own research, the work has influenced selection, training and player preparation at club and national sides around the world, allowing them to develop mitigation strategies tailored to individual players to reduce the risk of injury. The knowledge and data generated by the Sunderland studies are so pervasive that it is hard to categorically quantify the extent to which it is influencing practice, but it is reasonable to suggest that those clubs **\[S1\]** using the Sunderland work as the basis for their own studies have incorporated the findings into their own practice to some extent. Some specific examples of how the research is being used in practice are given below. Where national teams and top\-flight clubs lead, others can be assumed to follow. 

-  **The Football Association** use the research findings to underpin the training delivered in every training session for all sixteen England squads. The FA’s Physical Performance Coach has confirmed that the studies inform dialogue with squad coaches about the physical determinants of the game, what players should be prepared for, and what they go through during a game, feeding into conversations with players and staff about how the game has changed and continues to change. The FA has replicated the research questions and methodology from the Sunderland studies to apply to their own specific problems, allowing them to get the answers they need faster and giving them greater confidence in their conclusions **\[S9\]**. 

-  **Liverpool FC’s** Head of Elite Fitness Development and U23 Fitness Coach \(previously at Newcastle United FC and Tottenham Hotspur FC\) confirms that “ *this body of work has been really instrumental in helping us to train the players optimally to ensure the physical and technical capacities of our players can meet the benchmarks highlighted in the Evolution of the Premier League papers* **\[R4**, **R5\]** *. For instance, we can modify training to include intense physical and technical periods to replicate what was found in these studies. This intense training ensures they can tolerate the high loads expected week in and week out at both a youth and senior level and the potential transition from one squad to another*” **\[S3\]**. 

-  **FC Barcelona’s** First Team Sports Scientist confirms that the Sunderland research **\[R3**, **R4**, **R5\]** “ *helped us to shape the unique training methodology at FCB to fully prepare the players not only from a physical perspective but also from a technical point of view. The increases in high intensity running and passing metrics that were documented in the papers, especially helped us to adapt our training drills to include an overload in both of the above, so players were optimally prepared for the first team at FC Barcelona. Although the mechanism of injury occurrence is very complex, I believe that this training helped to improve the physical robustness of the players.”* He confirms the research’s potential to keep top players on the field for more of the season, with knock\-on performance, health and financial implications for the club, as well as acknowledging its role in inspiring the club to do more R&D of their own to fully define the physical and tactical training loads of various teams at the club. He concludes that “ *this evolutionary football research has helped significantly shape the physical and technical landscape of training preparation at youth and senior level at FCB*” **\[S2\]**. 

-  The Head of Performance Analysis at the **Romanian Football Federation** reports that the Sunderland studies “ *changed my expectations in regards to results of physical tests of players or when analysing technical data. It helped me in creating physical and technical profiles of players according to their playing position, in order to aid the scouting process. It also changed the thought process when analysing physical game data, now I look at the data of players and have in mind the physical demands for their position at the Premier League level as a comparison*” **\[S10\]**. The Strength and Conditioning Coach at the **Hungarian Football Federation** also reports referring to the work often in presentations across the country and using the research on physical demands as a benchmark for the level international players should be aiming for **\[S10\]**. 

-  **Sheffield United**’s Head of Academy Analysis uses the research to shape data collection processes in terms of the key performance indicators selected for specific positions to enable comparison of players internally within the club but also to elite level competition. It has inspired the club’s own very similar research project. He believes that “ *as the research has highlighted certain trends in the evolution of parameters, it is key from a club perspective to investigate if we are developing players in line with those trends. Once established this will have a wider impact across the club in terms of the prescription of coaching sessions and their physical and technical content*” **\[S10\]**. 

-  The Academy Performance Manager at **Brighton and Hove Albion** says that by giving a clear and detailed picture of the demands players will be exposed to during match play, the evolution studies **\[R3, R4, R5\]** have allowed the club to develop training drills and specific gym\-based sessions to better prepare players to meet these demands and resist the most likely injuries. These changes to training apply to the professional development squads \(U18 and particularly U23\) who are preparing for their next transition to the first team, although the learning is disseminated to professionals across the club. The variability research **\[R6, R7\]** has led to more pragmatic and analytical post\-match discussions between professionals and coaches. “ *Sometimes, particularly when a match result isn’t good, it can be easy to look at the physical stats and select players who are deemed to have ‘underperformed’, e.g. if their high speed distance was lower than usual. \[The\] research has helped us to establish what normal levels of variation are for these measures and technical measures and allowed us to interpret whether differences in outputs from match to match are meaningful or not*” **\[S4\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Collaborative research led by Queen Mary and Baxter, which, in 2010, acquired the Queen Mary spin\-out ApaTech™, which was set up in 2001 to commercialise Queen Mary research, resulted in the UK launch of the synthetic bone graft substitute Inductigraft™ in 2013. Inductigraft has enhanced bioactivity comprising equivalent performance to the gold standard, autograft, and superior performance to other commercial synthetic bone graft \(SBG\) materials and allografts \(treated donor bone\).  It was launched in the US under the trade name AltaPore™, with FDA approval granted for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2017, and posterolateral spine fusion in September 2018. In 2018, a ‘flow’ version of Actifuse™ \(initially launched in 2005 by ApaTech, also based on Queen Mary research\) was launched, which provides a finer fraction of granules for narrow bore application. Approximately 24,000 procedures take place every year using Baxter products with 98.9% fusion rates. The move from autograft to Baxter synthetic bone grafts has led to reduced complication rates and enhanced patient outcomes. In 2019, a Royal Mail stamp, dedicated to the innovation of Actifuse™/Inductigraft™/AltaPore™ SBGs, was issued as part of the British Engineering Stamp collection. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Synthetic bone grafts \(SBGs\) are highly porous materials \(>60% porous\) often consisting of a ceramic with a calcium\-phosphate\-based chemistry and an open foam\-like porous structure, which mimics cancellous bone \(the internal tissue of skeletal bone\). The purpose of a SBG is to stimulate bone healing or regeneration where the skeleton’s natural regenerative abilities are impaired or insufficient. Early SBGs were variable in both effectiveness and reliability due to a lack of understanding of the body’s biological response to these materials and their characteristics. 

 The QMUL spin\-out ApaTech™ was established in 2001, built on the research undertaken under the directorship of Prof William Bonfield and Prof Serena Best, both at Queen Mary until 1999, working in collaboration with Prof Iain Gibson and Dr Hing. The team optimised graft chemistry and structure, and developed novel processing technology to deliver superior synthetic bone graft substitutes, ApaPore™ \(2001\) and Actifuse™ \(2005\), to the clinical market. The company was acquired by Baxter inc. in 2010. Since 2000, Dr Karin Hing at Queen Mary has built on the teams pioneering research, in response to earlier observations of the sensitivity of bone regeneration to graft chemistry, macro\-pore structure and strut permeability. Dr Hing has investigated the mechanisms through which minor fluctuations in SBG chemistry and strut porosity can either enhance or impair bone healing. This has led to work that demonstrates that bone regeneration can be further enhanced by manipulating the exact structural characteristics of the porous ceramic foam. This has led to further refinement of graft structure, resulting in SBGs with enhanced bioactivity, and the clinical launch of Inductigraft™/AltaPore™. 

 Dr. Hing’s work led to the understanding that the sensitivity of bioactivity to chemistry is dependent on both the pattern of inorganic ion exchange and surface selectivity of key proteins, which synergistically direct bone cell recruitment, metabolism and function \[3.1\]. Further research demonstrated that increasing strut porosity in SBGs enables a synthetic graft to stimulate osteoinductive\-like behaviour when implanted ectopically in a recognised model of osteoinductivity, and facilitates faster and more reliable bone regeneration \[3.2\]. This is particularly important in the treatment of patients with impaired bone biology, multi\-level spinal fusions or complicated trauma injuries. This work led to the successful filing of a patent by ApaTech/Baxter \[5.1\]. The launch of Inductigraft/AltaPore was underpinned by studies that \(1\) show efficacy of SBGs with increased strut\-porosity in a critical defect orthotopic model, as both an autograft extender \(using ‘patient’s’ own bone\), as a standalone SBG \[3.3\] and in a challenging spine fusion model \[3.4\] and \(2\) further probe the relative roles of graft chemistry \[3.5\] and structure in enhancing bone growth \[3.6\].

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Inductigraft \(AltaPore in the US\) is a bone void filler intended for gaps that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure. These defects may be surgically created or from traumatic injury. The product is reabsorbed and replaced by bone during the healing process. 

 Inductigraft and AltaPore are delivered through Baxter, and are based on the 2003 and 2009 ApaTech/Baxter patents \[5.1\]. AltaPore received FDA approval for use in orthopaedic procedures in extremities and the pelvis in 2013 and posterolateral spine fusions in September 2018 \[5.2\]. The Shape version \(malleable putty instead of granules delivered dry or in a sculptable carrier, ABX\) was launched in 2019. 

#  Enhanced patient health and well\-being 

##  Clinical superiority of Inductigraft/Altapore 

 Inductigraft/AltaPore has been clinically reported to have “excellent fusion rates” \[5.3\] according to Michael Mokawem, Consultant Orthopaedic and Spinal Surgeon, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust, with 98.9% fusion rates in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and lateral lumbar interbody fusion surgery. 

 Mr. Mokawem further reported “12 months CT scans showing close to 100% fusion \(1 out of 150 failed\), whereas for other SBGs it would be 80\-92%.” Mr. Mokawem added that the Baxter products’ optimised levels of silicate and pore structures \(to facilitate development of interpenetrating vascular networks\) to “provide a microenvironment that facilitates osteoblasts to start bone formation” and have, thus, more reliable outcomes in surgery. The chemistry \(apatite based rather than tricalcium phosphate/calcium sulphate/calcium carbonate based\) means that these materials do not degrade chemically in the physiological environment. Any remodelling that happens is entirely cell mediated \(use of chemically biodegradable materials can result in complications\). Additionally, unlike traditional growth factor based treatments, Inductigraft/AltaPore is not contraindicated in skeletally immature individuals, which has enabled successful treatment of children and adolescents \[5.4\]. 

##  Improved patient outcomes 

 First, with use of Inductigraft/AltaPore, the surgeon is *“*able to reliably use Inductigraft without the need to harvest iliac crest bone to achieve excellent fusion rates, so eliminating the need for a second donor site with associated risks of infection, pain and complications associated with donor site morbidity,” according to Robert Lee, Consultant spinal surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital Stanmore \[5.5\]. Additionally, the use of SBGs means there is a reduced need for anaesthesia and, thus, reduced surgical risks to patients. This is because without the need to obtain autograft bone \(from the iliac crest\), the operative procedure is shorter so patients are anaesthetised for a reduced length of time. 

 Second, a patient treated with Inductigraft/AltaPore has a greater chance of avoiding reoperation or revision surgery because “the excellent fusion rates significantly contribute to the improvement in patient reported outcomes,” according to Mr. Lee \[5.5\]. Further, patients are typically released from hospital two to three days earlier, which has a positive effect on both the patient’s quality of life and that of their family, friends and work colleagues. 

 Finally, in clinical trials at month 12 post fusion, clinically significant decreases in disability were observed. Patients also reported reductions in pain and an improved quality of life post\-surgery. Motor, sensory functions, reflexes, straight leg raise and femoral stretches were either maintained, or improved in over half of patients \[5.6\]. 

#  Improved health economics \[5.4\] 

 Use of autograft involves two surgeries \(harvesting of the bone followed by implantation\), meaning 

-  The operation itself is prolonged 

-  Autograft harvesting procedures routinely have complications 

 For allograft and autograft, the risk of infection or immune rejection is significant vs SBGs where it is virtually zero. The percentage of patients returning with complications and requiring further surgery is therefore higher for allo/autograft, as, in the case of allografts, the bone has to be treated and sterilised before it is used. The faster bone growth associated with Baxter products also means that there is a reduced need for hardware, for example the insertion of metal supports. 

 The associated cost implications of the above are detailed in the table below: 

| Item | Baxter | Autograft | Growth factor therapy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Material cost /procedure | USD600\-800 | N/A | USD4,000\-8,000 |
| Operation time | 20% less than autograft, an average of 3 hours | \+USD1,000/operation ||
| Recovery time | 2\-3 days less than autograft, saving USD280/day | \+USD840/operation ||
| Complications | 21% less than autograft | \+USD6,000/operation | Potential for complications in 50% of cases |

 Based on approximately 24,000 procedures per year, Baxter products are estimated to save 

-  USD31,000,000 per year when compared to autograft\-based procedures 

-  USD74,000,000 per year when compared to growth factor\-based procedures 

#  Continued use of Actifuse™ \(launched in 2005\) in the current REF time period 

 Actifuse, launched in 2005 and the subject of a Queen Mary REF 2014 impact case study, is continuing to have a health impact. This is now expanding to areas outside of spinal injuries to knee injuries. A clinical study conducted between 2012 and 2015 found that clinical function outcomes after knee surgery using Actifuse vs autograft were comparable 3 years after surgery. The average operative time in the autograft group was 114 minutes, nearly double that in the Actifuse group \(64 minutes\), as using the SBG is a technically less demanding procedure than using harvested cancellous bone from the iliac crest. No complications occurred in the Actifuse group. In contrast, 1/20 patients in the autograft group required revision surgery at the donor site \[5.8\]. 

 In 2018, a ‘flow’ version of Actifuse was launched, which provides a finer fraction of granules for narrow bore application. It is unique in that it is non\-setting when injected \[5.4\]. Actifuse Flow comes ready to use with no mixing or preparation involved and maintains its consistency throughout surgery. The SBG is delivered directly from a pre\-loaded syringe with the ability to start and stop delivery, making use of Actifuse compatible with minimally invasive surgical techniques in addition to more traditional open surgery, increasing potential market size. 

#  Stimulated academic and public interest and attracted national/international recognition 

 In 2014, the Academia/Industry partnership, TERMIS\-EU \(Europe\) and TERMIS\-AM \(Americas\) Industry Committees used Baxter \(and ApaTech\) as a case study to demonstrate that there are a number of mechanisms by which industry can interact effectively with academia to transfer technologies to commercial partners \[5.9\]. 

 Outside of Queen Mary, Baxter products have been used as a biomedical technology ‘Laboratory Bench to Clinic’ case study in the syllabus of various undergraduate biomaterials/bioengineering degree programmes across the country. This includes Kings College London \(delivered to approx. 20 students, in 2017, 2019\) and the University of Manchester \(delivered to approx. 30 students from 2014 to 2019\) \[5.10\] \[5.11\]. 

 
The development of Actifuse and Inductigraft/AltaPore bone graft substitutes has achieved national/international recognition though the issue of a Royal Mail stamp \(priced at £1.60\) dedicated to the innovation of SBG materials able to enhance bone growth. The stamp was released in the British Engineering Stamp Issue \(May 2019\) celebrating seven key British engineering achievements of the last 50 years \[5.12\] and was described by Mr Philip Parker \(Stamp Strategy Manager, Royal Mail\) as a “very well received and successful” \[5.12\] stamp issue.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 One of the public responses to the Manchester Arena terrorist attack on 22 May 2017 was the creation of large\-scale spontaneous memorials. Before Arvanitis’ research project, there was little expertise in UK and European cultural and public sectors in collecting and digitising these kinds of memorials. In collaboration with cultural and public sector partners, Arvanitis developed a programme of research that produced impact in two main areas: 1\) the research informed collection and documentation policy and practice in the UK and internationally, and developed new approaches to the digitisation of archives of spontaneous memorials; and 2\) it enhanced  understanding and application of the role of archives of spontaneous memorials in post\-attack personal and community recovery. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Arvanitis’ research focuses on professional practices in the formation, documentation, digitisation and use of museum collections and archives. Following the Manchester Arena attack and the spontaneous memorials created across Greater Manchester, Arvanitis worked with Manchester Art Gallery \(MAG\) and other national and international partners to develop a collaborative body of research on archiving spontaneous memorials. This work was published in both museum and health\-related journals, demonstrating the interdisciplinary application and reach of the research. 

  

 **Collecting, documenting and using spontaneous memorials:** In June 2017, Arvanitis designed with MAG \(via a 6\-month residency funded by Manchester City Council, MCC\) a research project to address the legacy of the extensive spontaneous memorials in Manchester. This co\-produced work responded to the lack of expertise within MAG and the museum sector in the UK in dealing with such a body of material. This research on what is now known as the ‘Manchester Together Archive’ \(MTA\), a collection of more than 10,000 memorial items, produced \[1\]. This publication: 1\) developed and evidenced an understanding of how MAG staff adapted and diverted from standard collecting processes; 2\) argued that this decision entailed a creative process of negotiating perceptions of professional ethics and civic responsibility; 3\) identified the role of the MTA not just as a representation of the spontaneous memorialisation, but also as a material, performative and sensorial extension of it in the museum space; and 4\) demonstrated how the MTA impacted on MAG policy and practice and vice versa. 

 Before this research, most of the relevant existing literature focused on the outcome of initiatives to collect spontaneous memorials, rather than the process and negotiation involved. Arvanitis' research addressed this gap by developing an innovative mixed\-methods methodology that documented critically and creatively the process, decision\-making and impact of collecting, digitising and making accessible the MTA. This included autoethnography, participant observation, qualitative interviews, creative workshops and documentary filmmaking. Arvanitis’ research has offered a blueprint methodology that can be used in comparable cases elsewhere. 

 The potential applicability of this research to other national and international cases was acknowledged and supported by a British Academy \(BA\)/Leverhulme Small Research Grant to initiate an International Network of Archives of Spontaneous Memorials. A two\-day research workshop in September 2018 brought together 35 cultural and health professionals and policy makers from seven recent examples of large\-scale memorials after terrorist attacks or disasters in the UK and Europe. This workshop proposed ways that work on archives of memorials might be embedded in post\-disaster recovery policy and processes. Arvanitis captured the outcomes of the discussion in a Network Initiation Report and developed a first\-of\-its\-kind online resource for cultural professionals and policy makers dealing with spontaneous memorials \[2\]. 

 **Digitisation of spontaneous memorials’ archives:** The initial research raised questions about the scope, aims, use and users of a digital version of spontaneous memorials’ archives. Building on earlier research \[1, 3\] that demonstrated the limitations of existing approaches, Arvanitis initiated a collaborative project funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund \(NLHF\) that offered an innovative model for the development of digital archives of spontaneous memorials. The project partners were MAG and Archives\+, an archive centre of excellence in Manchester. The model breaks away from existing literature and professional practice, which tends to approach the digital archive as a digital copy of the physical archive. Instead Arvanitis’ research project: 1\) perceives such digital archives as collaborative and agile projects aiming to address different and contextual *uses* and serve different *users*; 2\) treats the digital archive as a dynamic, responsive and evolving environment of and for a ‘heritage of memory’, that continues to change as people’s relationship to and memory of the events change; and 3\) offers a digital experience that embeds in it the therapeutic potential of the digital archive for people affected by the attack. 

 **Role and use of spontaneous memorials and their archives in post\-attack personal and community recovery:** There is little academic literature on, and limited cultural professional understanding of, the psychological impact of spontaneous memorials on people affected by traumatic events \[4\]. Arvanitis collaborated with MAG and the Manchester Resilience Hub, an enhanced NHS outreach service hosted by Pennine Care in partnership with Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, and Northwest Boroughs Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, established in 2017 to co\-ordinate care for thousands of people whose emotional wellbeing was affected by the attack. The collaboration aimed to understand the process, benefits and challenges of engaging families of the bereaved and other affected members of the public with the development and digitisation of MTA \[4, 5\]. This collaboration explored the role of archives of spontaneous memorials in post\-attack recovery policy and practice.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The research produced award\-winning impact of significance and reach through two channels. It **1\)** developed innovative museum practice and informed policy on archives of spontaneous memorials nationally and internationally \[1, 2\], and created and disseminated new approaches to the digitisation of spontaneous memorials \[3, 5\]; and **2\)** enhanced cultural and health professionals’ understanding of the value of engaging people affected by terrorist attacks with the conservation and digitisation of archives of spontaneous memorials in post\-attack recovery \[4, 5\]. The research impacted on a diverse range of beneficiaries, as follows: 

  

##  1. Impact on collection, documentation and digitisation policy and practice in the UK and internationally 

 Manchester Art Gallery \(MAG\) is one of the UK’s major art galleries: in 2019, it recorded 750,216 visitors and its combined GVA \(gross value added\) contribution to the local economy was GBP13,500,000 \[A. i\]. The research changed MAG’s understanding of what a museum collection of spontaneous memorials is, leading MAG to treat the MTA as a continuation and expansion of its spontaneous memorialisation. This shift involved moving away from applying standard museum processes of documentation and collection management to the items of the MTA, and embracing its capacity to continue enacting the memorial’s characteristics as a performative, responsive, public and collaborative process of heritage making. This impact was captured in a co\-produced internal MAG collecting policy document, directly informed by the research. As Amanda Wallace, MAG’s Senior Operational Lead, testifies, *“Arvanitis’ documentation and research into the decision\-making of the formation and documentation of the MTA has enabled MAG staff to critically reflect on the meaning and value of this material for the Gallery and indeed its audiences and stakeholders. As a result, the research has directly informed the development of a new collecting policy at the MAG, which has since been implemented in the institution”* \[A.ii\]. This impact was further highlighted by the Audience Agency in its ‘Manchester Together Archive Evaluation Report’ \[A.iii\], which states that *“new approaches to collecting and archiving emerged through the nature of the collection as a spontaneous memorial, in opposition to practices that project staff would usually engage in or were familiar to them as standard”* \[A.iii\]. The research also led to a more widely transformative process in MAG’s purpose. It prompted MAG to consider the implications of the existence of this Archive in an art gallery context, and the extent to which the approach to MTA could be extended to the MAG’s art collection more generally \[A.ii\]. This change in approach is evidenced in the decision to create a permanent public\-private space for the Archive in MAG’s gallery space, which positions the Archive in direct conversation with MAG’s collections and visitors. 

 The research informed and shaped how the city of Manchester approached its memorial activity in the three anniversaries of the Manchester Arena attack so far, and its plans for a permanent memorial. For example, collecting and documentation approaches that were developed as part of the MTA informed the ‘Trees of Hope’ anniversary event in 2018, and the documentation of people’s memorialisation activities in subsequent anniversaries. 

 The research has given spontaneous memorial collections a more prominent role in archival and museum practices more widely. For example, the Stockport War Memorial Art Gallery drew on Arvanitis’ research to inform ‘The Art of Remembering’, a temporary exhibition in 2018. Over 2,000 visitors attended its opening and the Gallery received almost triple their average visitors in the months that followed. The curator Kate Turner stated that the research *“helped to interpret key objects in the exhibition in a way that was relevant to contemporary audiences. Being able to engage younger audiences with more recent examples of remembrance and temporary memorialisation had a huge impact”* \[B\]. Research informed the Manchester Museum’s 2019 exhibition ‘Jallianwala Bagh 1919: Punjab under Siege’. As Anna Bunney, Engagement Manager at the Manchester Museum said, it *“impacted on the exhibition and programme, by informing of* \[…\] *the need for staff training and support and the need for a quiet contemplative space for those engaging with the exhibition""* \[C\]. The research was also used as a best practice example of co\-produced research between a university and cultural organisations in two Museums and Resilient Leadership Programme workshops held in Manchester in 2018 and 2019 \(attended by 30 UK museum professionals who were enrolled on the Arts Council\-funded national Museums and Resilient Leadership Programme, designed to help participants become cultural leaders\). The programme director described the research: *“I can’t really think of a better example of a gallery or museum enacting its social, cultural and civic purpose.”* \[D\]. The research also led the Mass Observation Archive to acknowledge the civic importance of spontaneous memorialisation, choosing to include such memorials in their guidance to “Mass Observer” writers. 

 Internationally, the research secured impact in Europe, New Zealand, and the USA. It informed the documentation and digitisation approach that the Museu d'Història de Barcelona followed after the terrorist attack in Las Ramblas in August 2017. As Josep Bracons, Head of Collections at the Museum, commented, *“the model developed by Arvanitis was also used by the Museu d’Història de Barcelona in engaging people in Spain with the 2017 La Rambla attack digital archive,* \[which has been\] *accessed by people from one hundred countries around the world”* \[E\]. Similarly, it was used to advise the National Library of New Zealand on the timeframe, methods and challenges of collecting and documenting spontaneous memorials, after the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019 \[F\]. 

 The project’s online resource \[2\] and the linked Network, initiated by Arvanitis, have become a reference point for researchers and cultural professionals in the field. Gerome Truc \(CNRS, France\) writes that: *“Initiatives to collect and study spontaneous memorials have multiplied over the last 15 years, but without coordination. The creation of the spontaneous memorial network has made it possible to federate many of these initiatives, opening the way to comparative research work as well as the development of reference protocols and the sharing of best practices among archivists and international professionals.* \[…\] *this network constitutes for me, as for my French colleagues, researchers and archivists, a resource of great value and without equivalent.”* \[see 2, online resource; public user comments\]. Anne Eyre \(Centre for Collective Trauma/Disaster Action\) provides training, research and consultancy to authorities dealing with disaster. Eyre uses \[2\] in training for Multiagency Gold Incident Commanders across the UK, and comments that *“\[t\]he website continues to provide them –and me–with valuable resources, case studies and international  contacts to help with the practical management of memorialisation after mass fatality incidents”* \[see 2, online resource; public user comments\]. 

 The significance of the research as an international reference point for professionals is further  evidenced by: an invitation for Arvanitis from the UK and Ireland Archives and Records Association to write a short briefing paper in its professional magazine about collecting spontaneous memorials \[G\]; a request by PhD student Érika Fernandez, University of Alcalá, Spain to undertake a PhD research visit in Manchester under his supervision; the appointment of Arvanitis as the international member of the Society of American Archivists’ Crisis, Disaster, and Tragedy Response Working Group; and an invitation for Arvanitis to present the resource and his MTA research in the ‘Urgent Collecting Roundtable’ at the 9/11 Memorial Museum in New York on 29 October 2019. Jan Ramirez, Executive Vice President of Collections & Chief Curator of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum, comments: *“I am both fortunate and grateful to acknowledge the significance of the online resource dedicated to archiving spontaneous memorials that you and your colleagues have compiled and continue to pilot as a service to scholars, practitioners and others researching this proliferating global phenomenon. This timely resource has become a reference point* \[…\] *for cultural professionals and archivists in the field, who can be pulled into the vortex of documenting, disassembling and preserving the components of these grassroots memorials* \[…\] *”* \[H\]. 

##  2. Impact on understanding of the role of archives of spontaneous memorials in post\-attack recovery 

 The research enhanced understandings of the potential value of engaging people affected by terrorist attacks with the conservation and digitisation of archives of spontaneous memorials \[4, 5\]. The Manchester Resilience Hub has used the research to examine the application and impact of this cultural heritage of trauma on post\-disaster social cohesion and community resilience \[I\]. The research films captured and communicated how the tactile acts of cleaning, washing, drying, packing and shipping objects left in St Ann’s Square became part of people’s personal and collective experience of processing the trauma of the Manchester Arena bombing. Cleaning and bringing the soft toys to *“their former glory”,* as a participant says in one of the films, embodied a cathartic process for the people themselves \[5\]. MAG and MCC initially saw the washing of the soft toys or dealing with the amount of candles left as practical solutions to a problem of volume and storage and outside the parameters of the Archive. Arvanitis’ research prompted MAG to reconsider these actions, and the role of the MTA, as part of a broader way to engage with individuals and organisations, in post\-attack processes of personal and community recovery – which was then communicated to the wider public via broadcasting media and newspapers \(\[J\] is one of several examples\). 

 These ideas of recovery helped MAG to prepare for the visits to the MTA by family members of the 22 people who were killed in the attack and other stakeholders, a total of 144 people. As Wallace notes, *“MAG shaped the design of the visiting room and the interaction between staff and families through using Arvanitis’ argument that the Archive was a continuation of the memorialisation itself \(rather than just a collection of the objects from St Ann’s Square\). All 34 family members that visited the MTA were positive about its value and many stated that it helped them in their grieving process. Many also expressed the desire to visit it again and get involved in its development”* \[A.ii\]. As reported in the Audience Agency’s Evaluation report, *“people had a positive view of their visit and felt connections with the material in the archive. The opportunity to explore the material, the discussion that took place during the visit around the archive and objects, and the opportunity for emotional engagement and personal reflection were particularly valued”* \[A.iii\]. The above evidence demonstrates the impact that the MTA has had on the post\-disaster recovery process of the city and its people. This is further supported by: the standing ovation that the project received at a full MCC meeting on 3 October 2018; and the ‘Working Together for Manchester’ Award the project received in MCC’s ‘2019 Awards for Excellence’. 

 The NLHF project to digitise the MTA used the research to develop a dynamic digital archive that embeds its potential for the psychological wellbeing of online audiences in the digital archiving process. 80% of 390 people who were surveyed by the Audience Agency about the significance of the digital archive agreed or strongly agreed with the potential of the MTA to help people affected by the Manchester attack. As two of the respondents stated, “ *it can allow people to regain that sense of community originally felt at the memorial*”, and \[the digital MTA is a\] “ *way to work through grief*” \[A.iii\]. This included the engagement of volunteers in the digitisation process. Arvanitis’ research, which argued that psychological support should be available to volunteers working with spontaneous memorials \[4\], led MAG to develop a sensitive and supportive volunteering programme around the MTA and a relevant practical guide. 23 people volunteered on the project, giving 755.5 volunteering hours, with a value of GBP11,158.74 \[A.iii\]. Volunteers reported *“a range of impacts related to learning/lifelong learning; confidence and mental wellbeing; a feeling of purpose and sense of achievement; and a sense of fulfilment/personal benefit”* \[A.iii\] The guide was included in The National Archives’ ‘A Year in Archives 2020’ publication, which showcases influential best practice in the sector \[A.ii\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus \(HCV\) infection and advanced liver disease represent a severely ill sub\-population of HCV patients. UofG was a founding partner of HCV Research UK \(HCVRUK\), a national clinical and scientific framework that enabled the NHS and pharmaceutical companies to deliver new life\-altering direct\-acting antiviral \(DAA\) drugs to this population, improving patient outcomes. HCVRUK findings now underpin international clinical guidelines on treatment options for this patient group. However, in 5% of all HCV patients receiving DAA drugs the treatment fails. UofG research delivered the operational workflow for a national HCV diagnostic service, which together with a UofG bioinformatic resource, ensures that patients receive a suitable alternative DAA. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 **Establishing HCVRUK as the national infrastructure for HCV research** 

 The MRC\-UofG Centre for Virus Research has established an internationally recognised research profile for HCV. In 2007 **Prof. John McLauchlan** proposed establishing  [HCVRUK](https://www.hcvresearchuk.org/) as a consortium of scientists and clinicians working to address key gaps in HCV research and disease management. HCVRUK was established in 2011 through an award of GBP1.92 million from the Medical Research Foundation to UofG \[Grant A\]. McLauchlan led HCVRUK, with the co\-founding partner \(Prof. Will Irving, University Nottingham\) acting as the clinical sponsor. The grant involved over 30 co\-applicants and connects major UK liver centres, universities, public health services and HCV charities involved in the management and support of HCV\-infected patients. HCVRUK was subsequently extended to include 60 clinical sites through successful application for portfolio adoption by the  [NIHR Clinical Research Network](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/eligibility-for-nihr-clinical-research-network-support/23746). 

 Since March 2012, HCVRUK has integrated a biobank \(hosted at UofG\) with a bespoke clinical research database \(hosted at University of Nottingham\) to collate samples and clinical information from approximately 12,000 patients recruited from across the UK. With over 150,000 samples, the biobank is one of the largest HCV resources worldwide and supports clinical and basic research \[3.1\]. Between 2012–2019, HCVRUK has provided the clinical framework for the major objectives of STOP\-HCV, a GBP5.2M MRC\-funded, multicentre programme hosted at the University of Oxford \[Grant B\]. The contribution of HCVRUK to STOP\-HCV includes providing clinical data and samples, and ethical support to recruit a bespoke cohort. **Prof. McLauchlan** co\-led work strand 1 of STOP\-HCV — provision of well\-characterised patient samples and metadata from HCVRUK. **Prof. Emma Thomson** led on the development of HCV whole\-genome sequencing methods. 

 **Understanding treatment responses to HCV antiviral drugs** 

 HCVRUK and UofG research has occurred against the backdrop of the transformative introduction and increased use of DAA drugs to treat HCV; as such it has been well\-placed to undertake ‘real world’ studies to monitor responses to these drugs. In particular this included patients with advanced decompensated liver disease—where the liver has limited capacity to function—who were at significant risk of death or irreversible damage within 1 year, but in whom the benefits of DAA treatment was unknown. In 2014, the NHS England announced an Expanded Access Programme \(EAP\) to enable patients with advanced decompensated liver disease, or who were interferon\-intolerant \(the standard treatment for HCV prior to DAA drugs\), to receive DAA drugs before their formal approval by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\). Around 800 patients \(>90% of whom were recruited into HCVRUK\) received treatment with DAA drugs across approximately 30 clinical sites in England—one of the largest cohorts of HCV\-infected patients with advanced liver disease worldwide. HCVRUK provided a national framework that enabled patient recruitment to occur at all sites involved in the EAP, as well as the collection and release of clinical data and samples to monitor treatment outcomes. The HCVRUK framework also led to two high\-profile papers co\-authored by **McLauchlan** \[3.2, 3.3\], which addressed the effectiveness of DAA drugs in advanced liver disease and reported the first real\-world evidence that the drugs were well tolerated and achieved high cure rates among patients with decompensated liver disease. A further study from the EAP, led by **McLauchlan** and **Thomson**, highlighted the difficulties in achieving successful therapeutic outcomes for DAA\-based therapy for patients infected with rare HCV subtypes common in Africa and among migrant populations \[3.4\]. UofG developed and deployed a pipeline and workflow for next\-generation sequencing to support these studies \(outlined below\). 

 **A new diagnostic approach to identifying HCV genotype and resistance** 

 Despite the success of DAA drugs, their use can be limited by mutations to viral RNA that confer resistance. In 2016, **Thomson** led a study that developed a target\-enrichment approach to detecting low\-level, resistance\-associated substitutions \(RAS\) among patients with HCV infection not successfully cured by DAA drugs. Conducted in collaboration with STOP\-HCV, this study produced a custom\-designed probe set for target enrichment that enables rare HCV strains and subtypes to be sequenced and also validated the probe set and their use \[3.5\]. UofG researchers \( **Dr Rob Gifford**, **Thomson**, **McLauchlan**\) also designed and implemented a bioinformatic platform for HCV sequence data \(HCV\-GLUE\). Constructed to systematically download and store all publicly available HCV sequences \(>500 base pairs in length\), this platform holds over 80,000 sequences \(90% of those currently available\). HCV\-GLUE has enabled any RAS to be identified in uploaded HCV sequence data for all genotypes \(n=8\) and subtypes \(n=84\) \[3.6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 HCV infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis and liver cancer in the UK. As co\-founder of HCVRUK, the UofG has played a pivotal role in targeting new DAA drugs to HCV patients, particularly those with advanced decompensated liver disease \( **impact 1**\); and has changed international clinical guidelines to recommend such treatment \( **impact 2**\). However, not all DAA treatment is successful. By developing new clinical methodologies and patient\-stratification tools, UofG has also helped to operationalise national re\-treatment pathways to address treatment failure caused by rare HCV subtypes or drug\-resistant variants \( **impact 3**\). The HCVRUK biobank has also provided a resource to industry \( **impact 4**\). 

 **Impact 1: HCVRUK enabled treatment and improved outcomes of HCV patients** 

 The EAP supplied life altering DAA drugs to 800 patients with advanced decompensated liver disease, including drugs awaiting formal NICE approval. During 2014–2016, the HCVRUK framework provided the mechanism by which NHS England was able to evaluate the delivery and outcomes of the EAP, and reimburse clinical sites tasked with delivering this programme \[3.1\]. 

 The co\-chair of the Viral Hepatitis Advisory Group of NHS England at the time \(and current National Clinical Chair for the Hepatitis C\) said, “ *A central concern within the NHS was how this unlicensed use of drugs in profoundly ill patients could be monitored and the pharmaceutical drug manufacturers expressed concern about unregulated use … **a key component of our argument for early access was the existence of the comprehensive monitoring system available through HCVRUK**. … \[which\] **played a pivotal role in the Early Access Programme as a bridge between the NHS and the pharmaceutical companies, and ultimately had undoubted benefit to seriously ill patients**”* \[A\]. 

 The EAP was an acknowledged clinical success, despite the seriousness of disease in these individuals. **Of the 711 patients with known outcomes, 90% were successfully treated: 82% \(n=583\) achieved a sustained response and 8% \(n=58\) were successfully re\-treated following treatment failure** \[B\]. Follow\-up data from 602 patients treated in the EAP cohort also revealed the benefit of DAA treatment success versus treatment failure in terms of mortality—92.7% versus 63% survival, respectively. Treatment improved liver function especially in those with decompensated disease and halved the rate of significant deterioration \[C\]. Major pharmaceutical companies \(Gilead, Bristol\-Myers Squibb and AbbVie\) provided GBP17 million of DAA drugs to the EAP and received summary data that allowed them to evaluate real\-world effectiveness for the most in\-need patients—a population for whom very little clinical trial data was available at the time. The Medical Director of Gilead said, “ **This data was hugely influential in encouraging clinicians across Europe and North America to consider treating such patients for their HCV as opposed to just managing their symptoms**” \[D\]. The President of the British Association for the Study of the Liver, said, “ *At the beginning of this new era of treatment, HCV Research UK played a pivotal role in assessing the effectiveness of the drugs in UK patients with serious liver disease. This starting point was the basis for current efforts aimed at achieving HCV eradication in the UK*” \[E\]. 

 **Impact 2: Changing international treatment guidelines** 

 The findings of HCVRUK research now support treatment recommendations for the use of DAA drugs to treat patients with advanced decompensated liver disease: 

-  Since 2016, the European Association for the Study of the Liver \(EASL\) guidelines cite HCVRUK/UofG research \[3.2, 3.3\] to support the use of sofosbuvir/ledipasvir/ribavirin combination therapies in groups with decompensated liver disease. The 2016 Asia\-Pacific Association for the study of the liver \(APASL\) likewise cite EAP data \[3.2\] to support use of these drugs in this patient group \[F\]. 

-  Thomson represented the European region on the World Health Organization committee that in 2018 produced the HCV treatment guidelines. These guidelines cite UofG work on rare viral subtypes \[3.4\] as background, highlighting the lack of understanding of HCV genotype distribution in many parts of the world \[G\]. 

 EASL guidelines set the tone for national guidelines, such as NICE and the Scottish Medicines Consortium, which underpin the UK reimbursement strategy for HCV testing, diagnosis and treatment. England was one of the first countries worldwide to introduce treatment for patients with advanced liver disease. A Public Health England \(PHE\) report ‘ [Hepatitis C in England 2020](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/898221/HCV_in_England_2020_report.pdf)’ states that during 2015–2019, 38,784 individuals initiated treatment as part of the UK’s national DAA treatment programmes. Of these, 26% \(12,646\) had advanced liver disease \(cirrhosis\), including 1,226 patients with decompensated liver disease who may not have been prioritised for treatment without the work of the EAP and HCVRUK. 

 **Impact 3: Providing a pathway to HCV re\-treatment with DAAs** 

 Despite the effectiveness of new DAA drugs, NHS National HCV Registry data from 2018 show that 4.8% of these treatments fail, rising to 11% among patients with decompensated liver disease. Treatment failure prolongs the malignant pathology of HCV disease \(which progresses to liver failure in 6.5% patients each year\) and substantially reduces patients’ quality of life. It also perpetuates the costs to the NHS of managing chronic HCV disease, and increases the risk of onward spread of infection between people. 

 Treatment failure is partly due to DAA resistant HCV variants that emerge during treatment, but also due to naturally occurring rare HCV subtypes \(gt1l and gt4r\) that do not respond optimally to particular DAA combinations. These subtypes are most common among UK residents from Black/African/Caribbean/Black British ethnic groups who may have contracted HCV prior to arrival in the UK \[3.4\] and account for 20% of patients not responding to DAAs. Retreatment is possible with an alternative DAA combination but should be informed from knowledge of the previously prescribed treatment. 

 International guidelines offer no consensus on HCV resistance testing; nonetheless, UofG researchers have continued to help develop guidelines and workflows to support this issue in a UK context. In 2018, McLauchlan and Thomson were part of the PHE HCV resistance committee that contributed data on the molecular characteristics and analysis of DAA resistant variants and treatment outcomes of rare subtypes. This committee developed new PHE guidance \(2019\) for clinicians setting out requirements for DAA resistance testing in HCV management pathways, especially for patients undergoing re\-treatment \[H\]. The implementation of resistance testing in PHE is being facilitated by a workflow built on UofG research \(outlined below\). 

 <ins>Delivery of a new HCV diagnostic platform</ins> 

 Successful treatment of DAA\-resistant HCV requires additional information on the specific HCV subtypes and resistance variants present among affected patients. UofG research has provided an operationalizable HCV diagnostic workflow for detecting rare HCV subtypes \[3.5\]. The findings enabled PHE to implement a new national HCV whole\-genome sequencing \(WGS\) service, which has received \~GBP250,000 in funding towards additional infrastructure and staff costs \[I\]. The WGS service implements the UofG workflow and the probe\-sets that were validated using samples from the HCVRUK biobank at UofG, including African rare subtypes, enabling confidence in the platform. Launched in July 2019, the WGS service is supporting the rollout of DAA treatment by NHS England through designated Operational Delivery Networks, processing an average of 40 patient samples per week, directing treatment and re\-retreatment pathways for patients infected with DAA\-resistant HCV \[I\]. 

 Complementing the WGS service is the adoption of HCV\-GLUE \( [http://hcv\-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/](http://hcv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), see section 2\) by PHE and NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde health board to identify HCV subtypes and resistant variants. HCV\-GLUE is the first HCV sequence analysis resource based on EASL guidelines. It provides a unique, publicly available online resource, which draws on known resistance variants identified in clinical trials. As such, HCV\-GLUE helps to translate diagnostic screening into clinical practice by linking to defined treatment guidance for any specific resistance variant. To facilitate this linking, Prof. Thomson worked with PHE in 2017 to establish the PHE HCV Resistance Group, a clinical committee of 15 UK clinicians and clinical virologists, to assess the treatment options for a range of resistant HCV variants that HCV\-GLUE can identify, and to offer guidance on data interpretation for clinicians treating HCV\-infected patients. The HCV\-GLUE software is also integrated into the operational workflow of the PHE WGS service: “ *This has resulted in a clinical standard, robust and up to date genotypic interpretation tool, which is superior to existing publicly available options”* – Head, Antiviral Unit, PHE \[I\]. Between 1<sup>st</sup> November 2018–31<sup>st</sup>July 2020 the tool has been run 2,612 times by users in 22 countries to support genotyping and drug resistance analysis \[J\]. Offline installations of HCV\-GLUE are also used to support clinical decision making by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark \[K\]. 

 **Impact 4: Access to the HCVRUK** **biobank benefits industry** 

 The Medical Director at Gilead Sciences Inc. said, “ *The HCV Research UK database played a valuable role in supporting our work to obtain National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) approval for the reimbursement of our new HCV medicines, and to provide evidence of the effectiveness of the medicines in clinical practice, thus supporting increased uptake*”. Furthermore, the biobank stored approximately 42,000 samples from the phase 3 BOSON trial, conducted by Gilead, for use by STOP\-HCV: “ *HCVRUK in collaboration with the STOP\-HCV consortium were able to provide the framework that enabled the rapid delivery of a phase 3 study* ** **\(**BOSON\)* *of one of our new medicines \(sofosbuvir\). This provided the evidence supporting a shorter treatment duration, preferred by NHS England and UK clinicians, but for which very little data was available at the time of the launch of the medicine”* \[D, L\]. 

 Helena Biosciences used HCVRUK biobank samples to validate their Glyco Liver Profile assay—a non\-invasive test to detect and stage liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The Clinical Applications Specialist at Helena said, “ *The University of Glasgow and HCV Research UK were instrumental in acquiring a large volume of HCV samples to adequately represent this* \[chronic liver disease\] *population. Expert clinical analysis of the biopsy data provided alongside venous blood samples were an essential part of completing the validation of the original method.”* The samples enabled Helena Biosciences to define the cut\-off values that correlate with liver disease stages—to differentiate compensated and decompensated cirrhosis and to identify patients at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Launched in December 2019, the  [Glyco Liver Profile assay](https://www.helena-biosciences.com/en/clinical-electrophoresis/v8-nexus/tests/glyco-liver-profile/) is expected to help reduce the number of biopsies required, and the risks associated with this procedure, and to enable increased monitoring of existing patients \[M\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The UK social care market \(which has grown from £2bn in 2012 to £6bn in 2020\) is fragmented into Assistive Technology \(AT\) ‘niches’ supplied by specialist businesses who only have limited access to R&D investment and lack the ability to optimise their designs for their product users. Mainstream NPD \(new product development\) also needs to account for the needs of the widest population to ensure social inclusivity. Our research addressed this by developing a novel design process \(‘LUCAT’\), which delivered two key impacts: \(1\) Enabled niche designers of AT \(e.g. Nottingham Rehab Supplies Ltd\) and mainstream companies \(e.g. Philips, Arup\) to use a cost\-effective way to elicit user requirements and deliver optimal design solutions, and \(2\) improved the ability of people with disabilities, and the charities that represent them, to engage with previously inaccessible sports, such as Boccia and independent running. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research led by Dr Torrens, ongoing for the last ten years, aimed to improve the lives of people living with disabilities through developing a process to support new product developers of AT in designing products that truly meet the needs and wants of users in a cost\-effective way. Our research approach to developing this design process used novel participatory research design methods and heuristics, underpinned with theory and principles from social psychology and systems engineering. The resulting design process was called LUCAT \(The Loughborough User\-Centred Assistive Technology process\) **\[R1\]**. 

 The LUCAT process is a streamlined collection of design, engineering, ergonomics and human factors theory and best practice in User\-Centred Design \(UCD\) brought together to enable time\-compressed market research and evidence\-based design decision\-making. The process concept was based on Torrens’ experience of working in the field of AT product design since 1986. He then refined the process and through further research studies between 2010\-2020, has significantly expanded the methods and heuristics into the current LUCAT process with the support of Fray **\[R3, R4, R5, R6\]**. 

 LUCAT was developed through a practice\-based, bottom\-up participatory approach within AT product design, informed by Ergonomics and Human Factors theory. The research programme that underpinned the LUCAT process initially defined a suitable approach **\[R1, R2\]**. This was based on the conventions of design innovation, the fast time\-compressed and iterative cycle of participatory design, and best practice from small batch production design engineering. 

 These initial methods and heuristics were augmented by additional research into best practice relating to optimum formats of communication to be used by new product developers **\[R3\],** principles from social sciences and psychology **\[R4\]**, and applied within a mixed methods research approach **\[R2\]**. 

 Some of the novel principles and heuristics added to the LUCAT process included ‘social camouflage’ \(using principles from military camouflage to disguise unusual shapes and profiles within AT products that would be seen as ‘different’\); ‘blacksmith’s approach’ \(a one\-to\-one dialogue between designer\-maker and user that would have been commonplace in pre\-industrial design\); and, ‘technology footprint’, \(the visual area within the profile of a person with a disability taken up by equipment that affects the viewer’s perception of that person’s persona\). In addition, principles used in other disciplines but not conventionally within design development were also employed, such as ‘cultural blindness’, \(the differences in how people from different cultures perceive images – important for online sales of AT products\) **\[R1, R4\]**. 

 The potential for a wider application of the LUCAT process was shown through the review of case studies from other researchers **\[R1, R2\]**. The review highlighted the limited number of methods which designers use within new product development, \(conventionally four: literature review, task analysis/ usability evaluation, interview, and observation\), and the opportunity to apply the LUCAT process whose elements have been sourced from over 200 research and design methods in appropriate communication formats for this market **\[R2, R3, R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The **pathways** to impact for the LUCAT design process have involved collaborative activity instigated many years before its development. For 25 years, Torrens has regularly invited local and national representatives of charities \(e.g., Age UK, University of the Third Age, Motor Neurone Disease Association, Arthritis Care, REMAP GB, Vista Blind\) to collaborate on network events and student projects, linking their membership directly to student designers and the underpinning research being done by the research team **\[R4, R5, R6\]**. This collaboration provided a deep understanding of the assistive technology design needs of industry and charities. LUCAT is made accessible to practitioners via the Usability\-NET website \( [https://usability\-net.lboro.ac.uk/](https://usability-net.lboro.ac.uk/)\). This resource developed by Torrens contains a cohesive collection of inspirational and best\-practice research case studies to support those applying user\-centred design approaches to cost\-effectively design products to meet the needs of people with disabilities. The free resource, used by both practitioners and students, aligns the methods and heuristics with the relevant standards for the New Product Development \(NPD\) of AT. The LUCAT process has been presented at industry exhibitions and conferences such as NAIDEX and recognised through Industry Awards. It was a finalist in the 2019 Leicestershire LIVE awards for education, and a Graduate Inclusive sports product developer \(a recipient of LUCAT training\) won the Young Innovator Award at the same event **\[S5\]**, demonstrating knowledge transfer from education into industrial design practice. Over 500 graduates and postgraduates have been trained in the LUCAT process, many of whom now hold senior positions in consultancies or global brands such as Samsung and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Senior Usability Designer, Philips Experience Design, has provided evidence of how training in the LUCAT process has impacted on his professional practice **\[S1\]**. Together, the research and its pathways have led to the following impacts. 

 **Impact 1: Enabled designers of AT to use a cost\-effective way to elicit user requirements and deliver optimal design solutions.** 

 Our research on the underpinning design methods, applied using heuristics and an approach communicated through best practice and exemplars **\[R1, R2, R3\]** delivered a better way of doing new product development to designers and businesses within the AT product market. The LUCAT process addressed the need of inventors, start\-ups and small businesses to have an effective way of cost\-effectively gaining insights from the AT market. This is highlighted through the examples of a student enterprise project, Tap Dash, an inclusive point\-to\-point running game, and AT equipment development for Visually Impaired \(VI\) Boccia. The Inventor of the VI Boccia game had attended an event to bring student designers and people with a need for AT products together, organised by Torrens. 

 For example, the production of **Kura Care cutlery** demonstrates the effectiveness of the LUCAT process in practice \(Figure 1\). The cutlery was designed for **Nottingham Rehab Supplies Limited** **\(NRS**\). NRS had given invited lectures to our students and were aware of the work of Torrens before commissioning commercial design work. It was produced using the LUCAT process for a small budget and in less than three months from request to production. It followed an earlier research study of cutlery for NRS and applied Gestalt principles of perception \(associated with foreground background and applied through military camouflage\) to deliver ‘social camouflage’ for the unusually shaped products to appear more conventional, reducing stigma and associated product abandonment. **\[R1, R2, R6\]**

| --- | --- |

 The LUCAT process provided New Product Development \(NPD\) teams with a clear stage\-by\-stage process for rapid research and design methods including co\-design, reducing the time and cost risks within NPD. The Head of New Product Development at **Nottingham Rehab Supplies Ltd \(NRS\)**, a major manufacturer and supplier of assistive technology products internationally, and regional representative of the British Healthcare Trades Association, stated: 

 *“The Kura Care cutlery range is one of our best\-selling cutlery ranges. We sell approximately 30,000 sets and items per year, with increased sales year on year.”* **\[S2\]** 

 Furthermore, as evidence of the LUCAT process delivering cost\-effective solutions, The Senior Design Engineer at NRS, reported: 

 *“The training I had in the LUCAT process enabled me to get my current and previous job. I have introduced elements of the LUCAT process to engineers and healthcare professionals in my teams in each new role to more effectively gain insights from end users and stakeholders and deliver commercially viable products.”* **\[S3\]** 

 Other beneficiaries of the LUCAT process **\[R1\]** report its impact, including the cost\-effectiveness and suitability of the process for gaining user and stakeholder needs, ensuring appropriateness for the market. The Senior Usability Designer at **Philips Experience Design** stated: 

 *“A user\-centred approach to design is a core aspect of any project I lead. I have introduced much of the LUCAT process as described into our new product development process and to the multi\-disciplinary team, which has enhanced our ability to gain consumer insights.”  \[S1\]** 

 Similarly, a Human Factors Consultant at **SYSTRA** **Scott Lister**, reflected on how he had raised awareness of the process within his multi\-disciplinary team during stakeholder consultations, whilst on placement with **Arup Group Ltd**, a major civil engineering company: 

 *“...I knew within the first week of the brief that the elements of the LUCAT process were applicable to the project. ...not having an early codesign intervention, especially for an infrastructure project, would be detrimental… due to the success of using the insights, the organisation was considering adopting the approach for future work.”* **\[S4\]** 

 He was referring to the need to gain insights and an affinity from individuals and stakeholder groups, representing people with a wide range of disabilities, at the design stage who would use the transport system to avoid major additional costs due to alterations at the construction stage. 

 **Impact 2: Improved the ability of people with disabilities, and the charities who represent them, to engage in sports.** 

 The underpinning research **\[R1, R5, R6\]** was used by Torrens and Fray to gain a better understanding of the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, and the charities that represent them, engaging them in participatory codesign to produce outcomes with a sense of ownership. **\[S6, S7\]** The application internationally of the LUCAT process, is presented in the following examples. These show the reach and impact the approach has had on individuals, communities, organisations, and its usefulness in empowering individuals in different cultures and social groups to have the confidence to change their lives. The examples shown are \(i\) the **Tactile Boccia Grid** and \(ii\) **Visually Impaired Running Line**. 

 \(i\) Boccia is a Paralympic inclusive sport like French Boules. The LUCAT process was used with the Inventor and Visually Impaired \(VI\) Boccia players to develop the Tactile Boccia Grid, which enabled players to progress rapidly to an advanced level of tactical play and become competitive against sighted players. \(See Figure 3 below\). Since 2014, from a few local teams in the East Midlands, the game has expanded to two National competitions and is regularly played in over 30 centres around the country. Over 150 units have been used in 14 countries. **\[S3\]** The Director of **Handi Life Sport**, Denmark, the main worldwide distributor of Boccia equipment and products, including the Tactile Boccia Grid, stated: 

 *“...the device serves a great purpose of inclusion of the visually impaired players with the sighted players.”* **\[S6\]** 

 Furthermore, the Principal of the **Sense \(Formerly RNIB\) College** commented on the engagement between College students and University staff and design students on design projects, including the Tactile Boccia grid: 

 “*what's important for them is to be able to be with young people of a similar age to themselves and … exposed … to people outside of their usual frame … to mix with people outside this sphere of knowledge … that's a really important thing … to feel that their contributing to something really important.”* **\[S7\]** 

 \(ii\) The participatory approach and codesign stages from the LUCAT process were embedded in the research **\[R6\]** to produce the **Visually Impaired \(VI\) Running Line**. This enabled visually impaired and blind people to run independently of a guide runner giving them a sense of control and independence not previously experienced in their life \(see Figure 2 right\) **\[S8\]**. This VI Running Line enabled engagement with many adapted sports groups to deliver a wide range of innovative events, activities and interventions. 

 Many VI or blind people have never run more than a few steps in their lives, nor competed against other runners. During the sessions the VI Running Line enabled them to race against their VI, blind and sighted peers. The VI Running Line has been demonstrated at nearly 300 events across the UK and used by over 1,600 Blind and Visually Impaired children and adults, most of whom would have never experienced running independently. When parents and carers have also used the running line, it gave them a better understanding of the difficulties faced by those in their care. The Co\-Inventor of the VI Running Line and Inclusive Sports Coach, stated: 

 *“The experience gave parents an insight into the level of uncertainty and difficulty their children had in everyday living, moving and travel in their world and opening discussion between them.”* **\[S9\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Centre for SME Development \(CSME\) has capitalised on GBP22,500,000 of cross\-university funding which has assisted 1,744 SMEs, created 236 jobs and generated an annual GVA of GBP15,000,000 \[B\]. This significant economic impact has led to the CSME being highlighted in the UK’s Industrial Strategy for responding to business needs. The former Minister Jo Johnson commended everything that had been achieved by CSME as **“impressive initiatives.”** \[C\] Research conducted by the CSME has directly influenced Regional Government industrial and economic strategies, with Preston being described as the UK’s most improved city in 2018. Through the creation and implementation of the CareerEDGE model and the development of the Propeller scheme, the CSME has also created, supported and nurtured long\-lasting student start\-up businesses, ranking consistently highly in this area. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Richie’s ESRC\-funded research in 2007 evaluated the effectiveness of existing approaches to knowledge exchange between Small and Medium\-sized Enterprises \(SME\) and Higher Education. The development of an ‘Engagement Progression Framework’ recommended how effective partnerships could be established \[1\]. Whyman drew upon one of its key findings, namely the pivotal role of networks and clusters in SME engagement, to establish the ESRC\-funded SME network known as The Knowledge Network for Business \(K4NB\), which was in place from 2012\-2014. This provided masterclasses to 75 local business leaders, drawing upon action learning and research relating to access to business finance, human resources and dispute resolution, marketing and flexible work organisation. Positive feedback from this initiative, measured by satisfaction and business performance data, led directly to the later development of CSME with a subsequent paper on SMEs and workplace flexibility \[2\]. In parallel, research conducted by Dacre\-Pool and Peter Sewell developed the CareerEDGE model of graduate employability. It was the first such model to give Emotional Intelligence a prominent position in the concept of employability \[3\]. The practical result was the development of the University of Central Lancashire’s Propeller business\-incubation and student\-enterprise unit to further support student and graduate enterprise and employability, using the CareerEDGE approach as the foundation of its interactions. Propeller is located within CSME, where SMEs and students connect for mutual benefit. Smith was recruited to CSME in 2015 to build upon earlier successes and to draw upon her long\-standing record of SME research and business support practice, particularly around building peer\-learning communities to enable business growth and regional economic development. Collaboration between Smith, Professor Steve Kempster \(University of Lancaster\) and Dr Stewart Barnes \(Chief Executive Officer at QuoLux™\) has antecedents in their joint work on the LEAD management programme, established in 2004.  This continues to examine the role of educators in developing entrepreneurial leadership learning and the ethics of care through utilisation of SME peer\-learning communities \[4,6\]. This work had significance for theory and practice in respect of understanding the dynamics, challenges and opportunities involved in the construction and ongoing maintenance of peer networks. It also addresses how to stimulate entrepreneurial leadership learning which, in turn, has an impact on the regional economies in which the SMEs reside. The practical outcome was CSME’s creation of a growing SME membership package of currently 1,000 SMEs, to deepen existing knowledge exchange networks and create award winning Communities of Practice \[G\]. 

 CSME’s engagement with policy stakeholders in the regional economy resulted in the Lancashire Enterprise Partnership \(LEP\) and Lancashire County Council \(LCC\) commissioning research by Smith and Whyman to identify the drivers of productivity within the Lancashire economy \[5\]. Recommendations were made that research evidence suggested could improve productivity performance, particularly relating to the SME community. The findings were used by the LEP and LCC as part of the evidence\-base for the region’s Local Industrial Strategy and Strategic Economic Plan \[E\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 
CSME is business led, responding to the needs of the SME community from pre\-start\-up/fledgling SMEs via ‘Propeller’ through to established SMEs stimulating innovation and growth. Our starting point is to ask: “What is right for the SME?”. CSME facilitates the engagement of SMEs across the university with academics, business support projects, research, students and graduates. It also shapes government responses to productivity challenges in the region in a cyclical manner, enabling impacts for all \(see diagram below\). 

  

 <ins> **Local and National Policy Impact**</ins> 

 CSME’s research and business\-support activities have been recognised by the former Universities and Science Minister, Baron Johnson of Marylebone, as **“impressive initiatives”** \[C\] and have been highlighted as responding to business needs and local opportunities by UK Government \[A\]. It has also been described by George Osborne \(then MP and Chancellor of the Exchequer\) as **“chiming with the Government’s approach to business support”** \[H\]. Smith was invited on the LEP’s Business Support Management Board, enabling her to inform policy debate and to have an impact via influencing practice among Regional SME support organizations. 

 CSME works closely with Regional Government, policy makers and business support organisations. The interdisciplinary research for the LEP and LCC addressed productivity issues in Lancashire, which has been used to inform business\-support initiatives through Lancashire’s Growth Hub. According to Lancashire County Council, this work has **“directly influenced the development of the emerging Local Industrial Strategy which responds to the challenges set out in the National Industrial Strategy, including raising productivity rates across the UK. It has also been used as part of the evidence base for Lancashire’s refreshed Strategic Economic Plan” and “has informed the deployment of government funding by the LEP, as well as in the selection of Lancashire’s strategic investment propositions aimed at improving productivity levels and increasing employment.  These ‘shovel\-ready’ propositions recently forwarded to Government represent a combined investment of £38m to support the levelling\-up agenda in the UK.”** \[E\] 

 <ins> **Economic Impact**</ins> 

 CSME is dedicated to making an impact by creating tangible connections in the local social and economic ecosystem and brokering collaborations between the university and SMEs. The Director of CSME is a founding member of North West Mutual, a Regional cooperative bank with the social mission of serving the financial needs of ordinary people, community groups and small and medium sized companies, including cooperatives.  CSME is a key driver to changes in the business base in the region, via its research, networks and ecosystem building.  As a result of this, significant economic changes have taken place. For example, data produced by the Office of National Statistics \(ONS\) show that whereas in July 2013\-14, 26.7% of Lancashire’s population wanted a job, the equivalent figure for 2018\-19 was 15.8% \[F\]. ONS indices also show that the GVA per\-hour\-worked between 2014 and 2017 increased by 7.1 points in the LEP area \[F\]. This was the single largest increase of all 38 LEPs in the UK; the average increase among the other 37 LEPs was 1.1 points and the next largest increase \(achieved by Greater Birmingham and Solihull\) was 4.3 points.  Research was conducted by the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and the thinktank Demos. This used a range of measures including employment, workers’ pay, house prices, transport, the environment, work\-life\-balance and inequality to rank 42 UK cities. It found that Preston had improved the most in its 2018 Good Growth for Cities index. The CSME’s work has been attributed to having contributed to this \[F\]. 

 <ins> **Impact on SMEs**</ins> 

 The CSME facilitates the engagement of SMEs with the University of Central Lancashire’s holistic business support offer, creating an internal hub of projects, each based on topical and specific research findings and facilitating the sharing of academic best practice and innovative solutions to business problems. Through delivery of its own European Regional Development Fund \(ERDF\) projects and signposting SMEs to business support\-projects across the University, 1,744 enterprises have been supported by funded ERDF and European Social Fund \(ESF\) business\-support projects and in these enterprises, 488 new jobs have been created. This equates to a gross annual GVA contribution of GBP15,000,000, based on the average level of GVA per FTE in the Lancashire economy \[B\].  As one SME owner, Anne\-Marie Craven of Cafe2U has noted: **“The help has had a real impact on my bottom line and on the way that I think and approach the business…. I am not just thinking outside the box but I’ve removed the box \(a line I picked up at a Centre event\). My business model has changed completely, I am in an exciting phase where I have two further opportunities in the pipeline. I would not be in this position without the valuable support provided by the Centre.”** \[J\] 

 <ins> **Impact on Graduate Enterprise and Employability**</ins> 

 The CareerEDGE model has been a worldwide success and established Dacre Pool as an expert in the area of graduate employability, with her expertise sought widely, including by AdvanceHE and the Department for Education. The model aims to explain in a clear and practical way that employability encompasses personal, educational, career and professional development and is not solely concerned with the ‘job getting’ elements.  The CareerEDGE model is widely cited and adopted by academic staff at other universities in the UK and world\-wide, with CareerEDGE being used extensively by Careers staff and students across the UK. Dr Doug Cole at Nottingham Trent University highlights the impact of the CareerEDGE model, stating: **“I have continued to use CareerEDGE as an exemplar model when explaining to people what really matters for graduate employability over the last 13 years, highlighting the importance of this piece of work and the fact that it really hasn’t dated at all. It is broad enough to still be entirely as relevant today as the day it was written”** \[I\]. It has been incorporated at institutional policy level at the University of Central Lancashire, embedding employability into the curriculum. 

 The University of Central Lancashire’s Propeller service works with the university’s students, partners, graduates, staff and CSME development members to support people looking to start businesses and offering further support to these businesses throughout their first three years of trading. Propeller offers expert coaching and mentoring to students via skills and knowledge workshops, networking events and business advice clinics which cultivates enterprise skillsets and student start\-ups. Additionally, it provides an online platform which connects 139 freelance working students and graduates to the region’s business community.  In the 2017 annual HEBCIS survey Graduate Start Up metrics \[D\], the University of Central Lancashire ranked first across all universities for the indicators ‘number active’ and ‘number active after three years’, second across all universities for ‘estimated employment of active firms’, third across all universities for ‘estimated turnover of active firms’, and sixth across all universities for ‘the number of graduate spin\-offs established’. Founder of the small business Beer Candle UK, Katie Wright highlights the impact of Propeller’s mentorship, stating: **“12 months ago, I would have been really worried about setting up a business or pitching for funding but the support I’ve received from Propeller has helped me to become more confident and excited about trying the new opportunities that the business has brought me. Without the UCLan support, I probably wouldn’t have set the company up as a proper business. The belief that the help the team and my mentor…have given me will help the company continue to grow.”** \[J\]

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Over the past decade, the decline in conflict has reversed, with a particular rise in conflict recurrence. This trend underlines the importance of frameworks that guide external interventions to support transitions to peace and stability. The UK is committed to spending 50% of its GBP15,200,000,000 \(2019\) annual aid budget on fragile and conflict\-affected countries, which are home to some of the world’s most vulnerable populations. Zaum’s research has underpinned a change in the approach of the Department for International Development \(DFID\) and the newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office \(FCDO\) to peace\- and statebuilding, via its *Building Stability Framework* \(adopted in 2016\). This framework provides evidence\-based guidance on how UK aid can help build stability and meet the commitments set out in the 2015 Strategic Defence & Security Review and the UK Aid Strategy. In addition to underpinning cross\-government training on building stability through international peace\- and statebuilding, the research has also informed government spend of the GBP1,260,000,000 Conflict, Security and Stability Fund \(CSSF\). In so doing, it aims to ensure that aid can better assist communities, states and regions to make the long transition from fragility to stability. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The body of work conducted by Zaum which underpins the impact in this case study has three overlapping phases. 

 The initial phase \(2006–08\) encompasses Zaum’s research on legitimacy and statebuilding \[Section 3, Ref 1\] and was based on conceptual work, as well as extensive field research in Bosnia and Herzegovina \(2000, 2001\) and Kosovo \(2002, 2003, 2006\). It also included periods of working with the Office of the High Representative in Bosnia \(2000\) and the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo \(2003\). The research demonstrates how international organisations’ understandings of state legitimacy shaped their institution\-building blueprints and processes, including their interactions with local elites. It identifies the building of legitimate state institutions as one of their key statebuilding objectives. But it also explores the difficulty of doing so without regard for local norms, which are potentially in conflict with those of international statebuilders, and the detrimental consequences of this for the local legitimacy and the sustainability of local institutions. This issue was explored further in the second phase of Zaum’s relevant research. 

 The second phase \(2006–12\), supported by the ESRC \(ES/J00418/1\) and the Stabilisation Unit, the World Bank, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, encompasses Zaum’s work on the political economy of statebuilding. It examines the impact of different donors’ statebuilding practices on political and economic institutions in fragile states, as well as looking at one particular political economy aspect of state fragility: corruption. The relevant research is both conceptual \(for example, on the impact of corruption\) and empirical, and rooted in qualitative field research \(2008, 2009, 2010\) using process\-tracing and participant observation. By analysing anti\-corruption efforts \[Ref 3\], the research shows the tensions between statebuilding on the one hand \(where anti\-corruption efforts could support greater state capacity\), and peacebuilding on the other \(where the same anti\-corruption efforts could undermine the patronage relationships that sustained a degree of stability and contained violence\). It problematises the common notion in peace\- and statebuilding policies that different \(liberal\) reforms mutually reinforce each other. His contribution to an international research network on the political economy of statebuilding, which he co\-directed \[Ref 2\], highlights the importance of engaging with informal political and social structures for statebuilding, rather than focusing predominantly on formal institutions. This further developed his earlier work on the importance of local norms. 

 The third phase \(2011–16\), supported by a DFID Senior Research Fellowship in Conflict and Fragility, and an ESRC public sector placement fellowship \(ES/J00418/1\) in the Stabilisation Unit, built on the conceptual and empirical work of the previous two phases and developed their implications in the context of relevant policy frameworks. Zaum’s research in this phase explores the challenges faced by legitimacy\-focused peace\- and statebuilding policies and practices in deeply divided societies. It was shaped by close collaboration with DFID and the Stabilisation Unit through Zaum’s part\-time secondments to both \(2011\-2015\). In particular, it explores the difficulty of reconciling different audiences to whom legitimacy claims are addressed, and their different normative and political reference points \[Ref 4\]. It also synthesises and evaluates the evidence on different anti\-corruption interventions and policies in light of the insights from his earlier research on corruption and peacebuilding \[Ref 5\]; and in a study commissioned by DFID critically assesses the existing UK policy framework for peace\- and statebuilding \(Building Peaceful States and Societies, adopted in 2009\), both in terms of the underlying conceptual assumptions and empirical evidence \[Ref 6\]. This work, first, challenges the notion that different drivers of stability reinforce each other, and argues that building stability requires difficult political trade\-offs; and second, demonstrates that the existing policy largely missed the economic dimension of building stability. Finally, it argues that donors’ predominant focus on the formal state and its institutions neglects the importance of regional/international and \(often informal\) local dynamics and structures for building stability. Outputs produced in this phase \[Refs 5 and 6\] directly impacted the development of the new policy framework, and shaped practices in country offices.

#  3. References to the research 

 The underpinning research has made original contributions both conceptually, in particular with regard to the role of legitimacy in peace\- and statebuilding processes, and empirically, in particular with regard to the impact of external peace\- and statebuilding interventions on political and economic dynamics. It has generated novel qualitative data on peace\- and statebuilding processes, based on extensive field work. It has significantly contributed to the advancement of the peace\- and statebuilding debate. All of this is reflected in the research’s funding through competitive grants and the publication following peer review by leading academic publishers.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The rising prevalence of conflict over the last decade, and its consequences, such as forced migration, institutional decay and economic dislocation, have meant that a growing number of countries are considered to be fragile. Not only are these states at greater risk of suffering a recurrence of violent conflict, but absolute poverty is increasingly concentrated in fragile states, with estimates suggesting that by 2030, they will encompass over 80% of the world’s poorest populations. 

 In 2015, the UK therefore made two significant commitments with regard to fragile states: first; in the National Security Strategy \(NSS\), the UK committed to spend 50% of its GBP15,200,000,000 \(2019\) aid budget in fragile and conflict\-affected countries; and second, the UK Aid Strategy emphasised the strengthening of global peace, security and governance as one of the four principal objectives for its overseas development aid. 

 As the government department responsible for improving the coherence and effectiveness of British development policy in fragile states, DFID embarked on a process of refreshing its relevant policy, Building Peaceful States and Societies \(adopted in 2009\). This resulted in the 2016 *Building Stability Framework* which was underpinned by Zaum’s research \[Section 5, Sources 6 and 7\]. Now embedded in DFID’s country office strategies, the framework also operationalises the commitments in the NSS and the UK Aid Strategy. The framework provides a “an evidence\-based handrail” \[Source 9\] to policymakers for the development of strategies and programmes to address fragility, and informs cross\-government spend on fragile states. 

##  Development of the new DFID policy framework through continued engagement 

 Further to Zaum’s secondment to DFID as a Senior Research Fellow in Conflict and Fragility \(2011–15\) he was invited by DFID to critically assess the evidence underpinning its approach to building stability in fragile and conflict\-affected states. Forming part of the external advisory group, Zaum’s engagement resulted in the shaping of the new *Building Stability Framework* \[Source 9\]. 

 The development of the new policy framework comprised detailed consultations with a wide group of experts on fragile states. This involved Zaum’s participation in workshops, including hosting one workshop at the University of Reading in March 2016 \[Source 9\]; and participation in a further workshop in Cambridge in 12 April 2016 \[Source 9\]. At these meetings, ‘Building peaceful states’ \[Section 3, Ref 6\] \(produced during his secondment to DFID\) was provided to participants as “a comprehensive basis for our \[DIFD’s\] re\-thinking \[of the 2009 policy\]” \[Source 9\]. The key findings were also presented to different policy audiences across government, including DFID and FCO conflict advisors. For example, Zaum was invited as a panel member alongside the leader of the drafting team to discuss building long\-term stability at the cross\-government “Wilton Park Future of Conflict” conference in March 2015 \[Source 9\]. 

 The final revised framework, underpinned by ‘Building peaceful states’ \[Section 3, Ref 6\], was adopted in 2016 \[Source 1\]. The research was acknowledged by DFID as being “central to the development of the new framework” and it “challenged the key assumption in DFID’s previous approach that strengthening state legitimacy, in particular through enhanced delivery of public services, leads to stability” \[Source 7\]. 

 In 2020, the Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office \(FCDO\) commissioned Zaum to conduct further research to inform a review of the Building Stability Framework and the development of a new conflict policy for the FCDO. 

##  Embedding the new policy across government and training 

 Zaum played an important role in supporting the embedding of the new policy framework across the government. This included initially speaking at the DFID Professional Development Conferences \(2015 and 2016\), followed by a continued role in increasing skills capacity across government in three key areas. 

 First, as described by the FCO, Zaum’s work “has formed a central part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\) and wider British Government \(HMG\) training offer on Conflict” \[Source 8\]. As part of the FCO’s Diplomatic Academy offer, this includes staff working for international organisations such as the UN. Having won a competitive tender, Zaum produced an online module on conflict policy based on the key findings and arguments in ‘Building peaceful states’ \[Section 3, Ref 6\]. “Zaum delivered a high\-quality product, which sets out for staff the conceptual and practical tools available to HMG to best address the many conflict situations we face, from Afghanistan and Iraq, to Libya, Syria, Somalia, Myanmar, South Sudan and Yemen” \[Source 8\]. As of January 2020, the module has been completed by over 60 HMG staff \[Source 8\]. It has “helped develop HMG understanding of how to navigate the challenges and trade\-offs involved when the UK becomes involved in conflicts and post\-conflict situations overseas” \[Source 8\]. 

 Second, the research was incorporated into the Stabilisation Course, the core training course for civilians deployed by the UK \(DFID’s cross\-government Stabilisation Unit\) to support stabilisation efforts in fragile and conflict\-affected states \[Source 6\]. This “is run quarterly by the UK Stabilisation Unit for HMG staff and officials from other countries involved in stabilisation efforts such as the US, Canada, and Germany; as well as overseas training for recipient countries such as Somalia and Egypt. Ca. 100 participants per year take part in the course” \[Source 6\]. Zaum was requested by the Stabilisation Unit to offer the initial training as part of the course, and provided four training sessions in 2017 and 2018 on “What Works” in building stability, structured around the framework and his paper. Feedback highlighted that the sessions significantly improved the participants’ understanding of the challenges facing fragile and conflict\-affected states and the evidence as to “what works” \[Source 6\]. 

 Third, Zaum has provided training that has further embedded the use of the Building Stability Framework to the military through an online module on peace operations for the  [Army Higher Education Pathway](https://www.henley.ac.uk/executive-education/course/army-higher-education-pathway), a degree programme provided by the University of Reading for UK army officers in partnership with Royal Military Academy Sandhurst; and since 2015, through an annual lecture on addressing state fragility to the Joint Services Command and Staff College \(the training programme for senior UK military commanders and staff officers, as well as international senior officers, with an annual intake of ca. 150\). 

##  Adoption and implementation 

 The new evidence\-informed framework \[Source 1\] has changed DFID’s previous focus on strengthening service delivery in order to build state legitimacy. Instead, as the Independent Commission on Aid Impact \(ICAI\) notes, the “research questioned the causal links between service delivery and state legitimacy, prompting DFID to rethink its approach” \[Source 3, p.9\]. A second change in the new policy framework reflects Zaum’s research \[Section 3, Refs 1, 2, 3 and 6\] through a greater emphasis on engaging with informal and non\-state actors. Finally, his research has informed the recognition that different aspects of peace and statebuilding conflict, and require trade\-offs rather than mutually reinforcing each other \[Section 3, Ref 3\]. This “underpins the theory of change for stabilisation being set out in the recent revision of the  [*The UK Government’s Approach to Stabilisation*](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/784001/The_UK_Government_s_Approach_to_Stabilisation_A_guide_for_policy_makers_and_practitioners.pdf) *: A Guide for Policymakers and Practitioners* \(\[a report published in\] 2019\) as well as heavily influencing the  [Elite Bargains and Political Deals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/elite-bargains-and-political-deals) research project \(2018\), which underpinned the Guide” \[Source 6\]. 

 The Framework has also shaped the cross\-government Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability JACS tool \(2017\) \[Source 2\], the strategic assessment underpinning UK National Security Council strategies, and the GBP1,260,000,000 Conflict, Security and Stability Fund \(CSSF\). The JACS explicitly picks up the recommendation of the Framework to consider the regional context of stability \(p.13\), and to look at informal structures and non\-state actors \(p.18\). For some countries not experiencing conflict, such as Jordan, the development of the strategies and the programme portfolio by country offices and embassies relied on analysis directly based on the Building Stability Framework \[Source 4, Section 4.8\]. A number of DFID projects in fragile states have explicitly referenced the Framework in their business cases for CSSF funding \[for example, Source 2\]. These include the cross\-government CSSF flagship rule\-of\-law programme in Pakistan \[see also Source 7\], the CSSF Stability Programme for Lebanon, a civil society programme in Myanmar, and a regional initiative to counter illicit financial flows in Africa. The Building Stability Framework, has also shaped UK government strategies and processes including  [The UK National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security 2018 – 2022](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/677586/FCO1215-NAP-Women-Peace-Security-ONLINE_V2.pdf) \[Source 10\]. 

 DFID staff have confirmed that by November 2019, the Building Stability Framework was “now used widely across DFID’s field offices, including Pakistan …, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Nepal and a number of African countries. The Framework has become the foundation for policy discussions relating to fragility and conflict \(in DFID, with other UK Government departments and with our external partners\) and is helping to shape future thinking and directions in terms of decision making from Secretary of State downwards, and shapes funding in most of DFID’s offices … The Framework also served as the basis for a series of CSSF training events, which have been delivered by DFID” \[Source 7\]. Beyond the UK’s global approach to the EU, the insight from his research that “not all good things go together and that interventions in fragile states require trade\-offs between different state\- and peacebuilding objectives” \[Section 3, Refs 4 and 6\] is explicitly reflected in guidance from the European Commission for development practitioners \[Source 5\]. 

 In summary, addressing the global need for building long\-term peace, and reversing the increase in repeated conflicts, Zaum’s research has informed donors’ attempts to rethink their approaches to fragile states, not just at DFID/FCDO, but also beyond the UK. The change in approach is significant. It embeds research findings which emphasise the importance of considering difficult political trade\-offs as well as that of engaging with informal political and social structures for statebuilding. Government institutions are now equipped to work with local and international partners to reduce the terrible consequences of violent conflict and address the threats that are generated by instability overseas.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since 2004, Lancaster University Management School \(LUMS\) researchers have examined the relationship between the economic value added by human resources \(human capital, or HC\) and the propensity of companies to publicly report relevant data. The research has: challenged and redefined the principles and practices of the world’s leading accounting firms; led to the development of a new HC reporting framework positively impacting UK company disclosures; and it has supported HC research for a major global initiative, *Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism* \(EPIC\), which subsequently adopted LUMS techniques of measuring HC. In a culmination of the recognition of LUMS’ work, in August 2020 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \(SEC\) made a significant policy change that requires >7,000 globally significant U.S. companies to disclose the number of people they employ and any HC measures or objectives they focus on in managing the business. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The way we value our relationships with organisations and the products they create is changing, and this has a concomitant effect on the underlying financial value of organisations. People and their management are becoming increasingly material to this revaluation. Over a decade\-and\-a\-half, research carried out into performance\-led HR at LUMS has sought to raise awareness of human capital \(HC\) management, and to enable global corporations and their stakeholders \- investors, employees, suppliers and wider society \- to better understand how they manage, measure and report on the value creation of their people. In their early development of an alternative approach to HC measurement, Hesketh and Fleetwood were able to combine academic research with unusually deep levels of participative collaboration with leading global companies over a long period. These companies had combined strategic responsibility for around 7 million UK employees, approximately one quarter of all UK employees. 

##  An alternative path to understanding human capital: Return on Invested Talent \(ROIT\) 

 In 2004, Hesketh and Fleetwood interviewed 50 corporate executives in FTSE 100 companies \(such as Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank, Marks & Spencer and Tesco\), revealing the difficulties confronted – patchy and inchoate practices, inaccurate data – when using conventional methods to understand, develop, measure and report the value of HC in organisations \[R1\]. Between 2006 and 2010, the researchers set out an alternative path to understanding the value released by HC, one that took account of its materiality to a firm’s financial performance \[R2\]. Viewed retrospectively, this approach represented a marked, and sometimes unwelcomed, but necessary departure from a long\-standing focus in academic, managerial, consulting and financial circles on property, plant, and equipment, and recognised the role of HC in driving value creation \[R3\]. When these research insights and conceptual framework were unpacked in a subsequent piece of work with Deloitte, the resulting research led to a five\-step process to calculate gross and net returns on HC, conceptualised as *Return On Invested Talent* \(ROIT\) \[R4\]. This gave a firm’s executives, shareholders and other interested parties an objective, analytically informed measure of the financial implications of employee\-related interventions – the opening salvo on the long journey towards a change in U.S. financial reporting regulations that recognised HC factors as ‘material’ to investors’ or wider stakeholders’ concerns. 

##  New standards for human capital disclosures: Valuing Your Talent 

 In 2013, following increased awareness among practitioners of his work, Hesketh obtained funding from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills \(UKCES\) for the Valuing Your Talent \(VyT\) research project. In collaboration with the three professional bodies representing accountancy \(CIMA\), management \(CMI\) and human resources \(CIPD\), Hesketh developed, tested, and published a significant piece of empirical research \[R5\] with participation by 70 major companies \(e.g. Asda, Diageo, Nestle, Oracle\) and the investment and regulation communities \(Financial Reporting Council, International Accounting Standards Board\). Supporting case studies \(Microsoft, Xerox, Unilever, Arcelor Mittal\) illustrated the processes and practices of HC management in leading multinationals. Analysis mapped and established the financial value of HC through a new analytical framework to inform disclosures by companies. This meant narrowing down indicative metrics from an unwieldy 400\-plus to just 4: employee turnover, well\-being, training and cost. 

##  Performance advantage and human capital disclosure: EPIC 

 In November 2016, accounting firm Ernst & Young \(EY\) and the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism in the US, invited LUMS to develop a new human capital disclosure instrument based on \[R5\] for inclusion in the *Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism* \(EPIC\) \[R6\]. EPIC was set up with the intention of making corporate reporting more useful by developing a framework and metrics to better articulate the long\-term value created by businesses. Participants included 31 CEOs from asset owners \(pension managers such as CalPERS\), asset managers \(investment banks such as J.P. Morgan\) and companies \(leading global firms such as Johnson & Johnson\). 

 Building on techniques from ROIT and VyT research, Hesketh examined the HC reporting practices of the globe’s top 700 firms by revenue. Findings demonstrated that: HC disclosers perform better, and are disproportionately represented in the highest performing firms; that financial performance increases in step with HC reporting intensity; and that higher levels of HC disclosure on average secure higher levels of operating margin and retain higher levels of earnings to reinvest in the future returns of their businesses. Hesketh’s financial equation was endorsed by EPIC participants and enabled the initiative to establish the return on invested talent \(or ROIT\) for those firms with deeper and wider levels of HC reporting \(GBP3.17 for every GBP1 invested\) were nearly three times those with the lowest levels of HC disclosure \(GBP1.17\) \[R6\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 LUMS research has had an impact on professional bodies and services in the UK and the US, providing an impetus for debate about the value of HC disclosure, redefining best practice, influencing professional standards and codes of practice, and underpinning authoritative guidance. Hesketh and Fleetwood’s work has had an impact on public policy in the US, as an important lobbying tool to mandate for deeper HC disclosures and influencing policy decisions at the highest level, leading to a draft Bill before U.S. Congress to amend the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act to include all of the indicators represented in LUMS research. 

 In the words of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, LUMS work on VyT, “ *helped create a new human capital management framework to enable organisations to improve how they generate, report and analyse HR data to support strategic investment in people”* \[S1\]. 

 In February 2014, LUMS research was discussed at an All Parliamentary Group Roundtable in the House of Commons contributing to the future of management and leadership in the UK \[S2\]. Additional government\-funded research after the Roundtable \[S3\(a\)\] demonstrated human capital reporting increased by 18% in the UK in the immediate period after the publication of the VyT research report, with a second and more recent report highlighting how 3 of the 4 specific human capital elements prescribed by the original LUMS research –   wellbeing, employee turnover and training – had increased by 113%, 22% and 31% respectively, between 2013 and 2017 \[S3\(b\)\]. 

 Between 2016 to 2018, participation in EPIC accelerated the reach of LUMS research on a global scale. The participants publicly endorsing LUMS research represented the collective power and diversity of 31 firms across the entire investment chain, with USD30 trillion of assets under management and almost 2 million employees around the world. Hesketh’s original ROIT equation and VyT’s human capital disclosure items were incorporated into EPIC’s final recommendations and a Statement of Support was published in the Wall Street Journal and signed by CEOs of all participating firms \[S4\]. The research was formally acknowledged as central by the Chair of the Human Capital Deployment Group of EPIC, who noted that the findings of her group were, *“the most credible and tangible of the nine workstreams and the basis of this success is the work \[Lancaster\] did…* *\[Hesketh\] was central to this work continuing to move forward”* \[S5\]. 

 **Impact on policy and law** 

 The Chair of the EPIC Human Capital Deployment group, also a senior executive at Johnson & Johnson, added that LUMS research, “ *played a central role in shaping the thinking of EPIC and continuing the post\-EPIC impact of the research with the SEC and Congress”*’ \[S5\]. 

 The collective power of the EPIC participants triggered the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \(SEC\) into debating the inclusion, for the first time, of HC disclosures via its Investor Advisory Committee \(IAC\). LUMS research \[R1\], \[R5\], \[R6\] was pivotal to the deliberations \[S6\], and IAC members voted to take HC disclosure through to the SEC’s roundtable stage for consideration for inclusion. 

 Subsequent testimonies before the US House of Representatives made specific mention of Lancaster’s research. These came from a senior executive at AFL\-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the US \[S7\(a\)\]; and the Managing Investment Director, Board Governance & Sustainability, of California Public Employees’ Retirement System \(CalPERS\), who is also a member of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee, who testified that, *“Our investment beliefs are grounded in an extensive review of evidence during CalPERS’ Sustainable Investment Research Initiative. This evidence has since been strengthened by the work of Dr Anthony Hesketh who presented to the CalPERS board yesterday in order to highlight the growing case for human capital disclosure by firms”* \[S7\(b\)\]. Hesketh’s research was also cited in a May 2020 joint letter from a Senator and a Congresswoman to the chairman of the SEC calling on them to improve their human capital management reporting requirements by updating Regulation S\-K 101\(c\)\(1\)\(xiii\) \[S7\(c\)\]. The SEC’s policy adoption and implementation process is recognised as being extremely rigorous and evidence\-based,  [embedding research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEZk82ANEFY) directly into policy development, even more so than the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority \(FCA\). 

 On 26 August 2020, the SEC voted to change Regulation S\-K 101\(c\)\(1\)\(xiii\) which requires firms to disclose, *“a description of the registrant’s human capital resources to the extent such disclosures would be material to an understanding of the registrant’s business”* \[S8\]. 

 In October 2020, the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, observed how human capital management reporting has increased by 188% across the 214 companies in its portfolio \[S9\(a\)\], accompanied by releases by other ‘Big Four’ auditors Deloitte \[S9\(b\)\] and PwC \[S9\(c\)\] bringing the significance of the SEC’s ruling to the attention of their clients. 

##  Impact on professional services 

 Hesketh’s work has changed the attitudes of executives and regulators to enhancing the practices of HC measurement and disclosures. ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, Deloitte, followed by EY, have adopted the *Return On Invested Talent* \(or ROIT\) equation in their advice to their clients in meeting the formal requirements for measuring the value of human capital \[S10\(a\),\(b\)\] with coverage by CFO Magazine *,* with a readership of 44,000 senior financial decision\-makers every month, acknowledging the impact of LUMS research on the SEC’s original recognition of human capital \[S10\(c\)\]. Hesketh’s Valuing your Talent research, as well as the work of EPIC, are cited several times in the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s  [December 2020 revised Preliminary Framework on Human Capital and the SASB Standards **.**](https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Human-Capital_Preliminary-Framework_2020-December_FINAL.pdf) LUMS research has also played an important role in a new Draft Bill, under consideration by U.S. Congress \[S11\(a\)\]. The wording of the bill, which is supported by the AFL\-CIO and is currently under consideration by the US House of Representatives. Although delayed due to COVID\-19, it includes specific items of human capital disclosure outlined in LUMS original Valuing your Talent and EPIC. In the words of the SEC’s guidance note prepared for the initial Congressional Hearing: *“because …\[human capital\] disclosures are not required and are thus only voluntary in the US, only 15% of S&P 500 firms do so \(Hesketh, 2020\). However, according to research from the Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism \(EPIC\), a project bringing together businesses with more than $1.5 trillion in market capitalization and asset managers managing more than $30 trillion, those U.S. companies that voluntarily disclose this information outperform those that do not and receive better returns on their investment in human capital \(Hesketh, 2020\)*” \[S11\(b\)\].

1.  **Summary of the impact **\(indicative maximum 100 words\)** 

 Creating information on archaeological sites at risk from damage is a prerequisite for better protection. The adoption and use of the EAMENA \(Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and Northern Africa\) database by heritage professionals in Yemen, Palestine, and Jordan has led to those countries being able to create their own national heritage inventories, and improved understanding and preservation of archaeological sites. The project’s focus on satellite imaging has also led to changes to satellite policy in the US, with implications for human rights monitoring in the MENA region. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research **\(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

 In the early 2010s, the events of the Arab Spring saw systemic material damage to heritage sites in the region. In response, a team of archaeologists at the University of Oxford decided to use their skills to address how satellite and aerial archaeology could aid heritage protection in the MENA \(Middle East and Northern Africa\) region. Their expertise and experience was initially honed through collaboration on projects such as Historic England’s National Mapping Programme \(NMP\), which was created to help understand archaeological sites visible from the air with a view to protecting a sample of them, and the EAMENA’s precursor Aerial Photographic Archive for Archaeology in the Middle East \(APAAME – previously hosted at the University of Western Australia, and hosted at the University of Oxford from 2015 onwards\). APAAME research produced at the University of Oxford which fed into later research is visible in **R1**. 

 In 2015, Wilson and Bewley formed EAMENA \(Endangered Archaeology in the Middle East and Northern Africa\). EAMENA uses publicly available satellite and aerial imagery, maps and published sources to record and assess archaeological sites in the MENA region. This information is recorded in the EAMENA database \( [https://database.eamena.org](https://database.eamena.org/)\); an accessible database for research and heritage management, which is built using Arches \- an open\-source platform supported by the Getty Conservation Institute and World Monuments Fund, which means it is purpose\-built for and freely accessible to heritage professionals. The methodology for the project, and early findings for Jordan, Yemen and Saudi Arabia are outlined in **R1**. 

 EAMENA is a collaboration led by the University of Oxford \(Wilson and Bewley, supported by 18 researchers\), with partners at Leicester \(Louise Rayne, David Mattingly\), Durham \(Graham Philip\), and Isber Sabrine \(Institucion Milá y Fontanals, Spain\). The Oxford team, as leads, have together developed the database structure \(Jennings, Zerbini and Fisher\), the methodology for data recording, condition assessment, and data analysis \(contributed to by whole team\). Each partner has taken the lead for a particular geographical sphere:  **Oxford**: \(Jordan, Palestine, Yemen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE and Mauritania\) **; Leicester**: \(North Africa – Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco\); and **Durham** \(Syria, Iraq, Lebanon\). 

 As a result of the team’s research since 2015, the EAMENA database \[ **R1**\] contains over 309,000 records of heritage sites across the MENA region, approximately 75% of which have not previously been digitally recorded. The data are used for research, on the distribution of sites \(by date, function and form\), and threats to those sites; conflict, looting, urban development, infrastructure projects, agriculture, mining, natural erosion and climate change \[ **R2**\]. The research has provided evidence which countered conventional expectations: for example, in Egypt, despite claims that looting was the major threat to archaeological sites, the EAMENA research, on 9,000 sites over 50,000 km<sup>2</sup>, showed that although looting was a serious problem, the indiscriminate bulldozing of sites in the Eastern Desert had caused far more widespread destruction by comparison \[ **R3**\]. As well as analysing the nature of these threats, the data have also been used to assess the likelihood and pattern of threats to those sites: for example, Brodie has documented the illicit trade in cuneiform tablets \(Iraq\) and ancient coins \(Syria\) \[ **R4**\]. 

 **Jordan, Yemen and Palestine** 

 In Jordan the project built on the foundation of the APAAME project to collate information on several thousand sites and assess threats to them  – notably agricultural intensification, urban population expansion, and road building. In particular, the research focused on landscapes threatened by road building  – the Amman and Azraq bypasses, and the Madaba ring road \[ **R1**\]. In Yemen, the research identified c. 8,500 unrecorded sites across 3000<sup>2</sup> km \[ **R5**\] **,** with J. Schiettecatte \(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris\), and later verified war damage, providing impartial and scientific reports on the aerial bombing of a religious site on Jabal an Nabi Shu’ayb \(2017\), and damage to the archaeological site of al\-Qawbah by explosives \(2020\). No other project has attempted to rapidly record archaeological sites in as many countries. The research has also explored the use of satellite imagery in areas where it has been deliberately downgraded. Research by Zerbini and Fradley \[ **R6**\] urged reform of the Kyl\-Bingaman amendment which since 1997 has prevented US satellite operators from distributing high\-resolution imagery of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Their article outlined how these restrictions reduced the ability of researchers to identify and record archaeological sites by restricting this visibility, and indicated that higher\-resolution imagery was already accessed by commercial satellite operators in the same region.

1.  **Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\)** 

 **Capacity building for heritage professionals in the MENA region** 

 The research which designed, created, and populated the database formed the basis for 22 training workshops in satellite imagery interpretation, GIS techniques, and the use of the EAMENA database \[ **R1**\] for 160 heritage professionals from the Department of Antiquities in 8 countries: Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen \[ **E1**\]. The training workshops were funded by the British Council’s Cultural Protection Fund, with the award held at the University of Oxford as the project lead, and delivered by Training Managers based in Oxford, Durham and Leicester. Workshops took place between November 2017 and November 2019. Trainees learned from the database how to identify sites from satellite imagery, recording location, chronology, and threat assessments. Trainees used the skills taught during the training to systematically record and survey archaeological sites and to identify and understand the impact of different development projects on heritage sites. A Lebanese trainee said in the workshop feedback: 

 *‘The basic and the advanced training of the EAMENA programmes has helped me to add several important elements in my archaeological work. Firstly, I can now determine the archaeological site by remote sensing. Secondly, I can identify potential risks to archaeological sites such as rapid urbanisation or agri\-business etc. Thirdly, with the generated data and the scientific tools that have been taught, I have begun to explore research questions. And the important point is that I am able to do all these from my office.’* \[ **E1**\] 

 Over 90% of the 40 Libyan and Tunisian workshops attendees \(2017\-2018\) reported in training feedback \[ **E1**\] that the database skills are relevant to their current jobs, and they would strongly recommend the workshops to other colleagues as well. 

 **Heritage management and protection:** **Country\-specific inventories for Palestine, Jordan, and Yemen** 

 Training on the EAMENA database for the Departments of Antiquities of Palestine, Jordan, and Yemen, and EAMENA’s *Protecting the Past* conferences \(featuring presentations on the team’s work to members of these Departments\) in 2017–2019 led to requests by the heads of those Departments for national inventory databases, based on the EAMENA database, to be used to manage their cultural heritage, and assess and mitigate threats \( **E2**, **E4**, **E6**\). The signed agreement with Palestine from March 2018 \[ **E2**\] directly acknowledges the ‘ *intensive training*’ provided by the EAMENA team, and that ‘ *the MoTA* \[Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities\] *has agreed that such \[a\] national heritage platform should be based on the EAMENA system’*. As well as the development of this platform, it proposes a formal joint working\-group with EAMENA to create this database according to Palestinian needs, and also commits to ‘ *training and capacity building for the Palestinian Department of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage \(DACH\) via the EAMENA methodology*’. 

  

 In an evaluation interview undertaken by the EAMENA team in March 2019, the Director\-General of Antiquities for Palestine said how EAMENA had improved the existing cultural heritage database, and how it has quickly been taken up by their department: 

 “*The existing MOTA database is difficult to use and needs advanced GIS skills and Autocad. It is not user\-friendly. Not all staff can use it for research and data entry. Also, there is no digital access to it. But the EAMENA database is easy to use by local staff and academics for research and data management. Researchers, academics, and heritage professionals in Palestine have access to its online digital system.* 

 *The government is working on a new Palestinian National Spatial Plan, including cultural heritage and archaeology. The EAMENA\-based database can be part of that plan at the national level.* 

 *MOTA staff are currently using the EAMENA database in their daily work for heritage protection and impact assessment. The database has also helped MOTA for public outreach and awareness raising.*” \[ **E3**\] 

 Similarly, Jordan’s cultural heritage management system \(MEGA\-Jordan\), also needed updating. It lacked many features of the EAMENA database. As a result of the training the Department of Antiquities \(DoA\) asked EAMENA for a Jordan\-specific version of the EAMENA database. DoA training on the prototype of the new platform began in November 2019, following the signature of the agreement \[ **E4\]**. Covid\-19 has delayed implementation, but as of December 2020, the database team from Jordan's DoA have now been trained in the EAMENA v3 database, which is the prototype of the new platform for Jordan. They had a chance to test the new system by creating new records. They will keep their access to the EAMENA’s central database in order to undertake further testing and a review for the creation of their own customised database. Despite these delays, staff of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan have already used the database to analyse and monitor threats to the archaeology of Jerash \(video, **E5**\), in particular updating the watch list of the most threatened significant archaeological sites. In December 2020, all Jordanian trainees produced a watch list of the most threatened and significance sites in their region/area of work. In total the trainees have compiled records for 66 sites, monuments, and features so far. 

 Yemen had no database to manage cultural heritage sites, nor even a comprehensive paper list. The signed agreement of July 2017 \[ **E6**\] between EAMENA and the General Organization of Antiquities and Museums \(GOAM\) agreed to the development of a Yemeni Heritage Management Platform \(YHMP\), ‘ *which will be extracted from the current EAMENA platform that is based on the open source ARCHES v.3 system’*. The EAMENA team developed this YHMP, populated with about 37,000 records, and trained Yemeni staff in January 2020. **E6** recognises that the need for YHMP had been identified by the UNESCO Doha Office, who are also part of the partnership supporting the aims of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, it was noted that *‘the majority of experts and staff* \[of GOAM\] *… cannot reach most of these archaeological and heritage sites in Yemen due to the security situation’* \[ **E6**\]. Planned training led by the EAMENA team was due to take place in 2020, but Covid\-19, as well as infrastructure problems, have delayed this. However, the agreement ensures a legal commitment to the creation of the first digital heritage monitoring platform for the country. 

 UNESCO are not the only arm of the UN to benefit from EAMENA findings: in 2016, the EAMENA team submitted evidence to the UN’s Special Rapporteur on Human Rights. Special Rapporteurs conduct fact\-finding missions to assess and verify allegations of human rights abuses. Her report to the UN General Assembly, on international heritage destruction and human rights, cited EAMENA 4 times in footnotes – most notably, drawing attention to particular examples of heritage sites that have been at risk, or destroyed by both states and non\-state actors. These include destruction of ‘ *Coptic churches and monasteries in Egypt, Jewish sites in Tunisia, and hundreds of shrines belonging to the Sufi sect of Islam across Northern Africa*’ \( **E8**, p.12, ft.26\) and how ‘ *Sometimes actions of States and non\-State actors affect the same site in succession, as has been alleged to be the case in Palmyra, for example*’ \( **E8**, p.12, ft.29\). As such, the EAMENA research has helped **to inform and verify understanding** of heritage protection issues at the highest possible international level. 

 **Impact on US satellite policy** 

 Since the publication of **R6** in 2018, Zerbini and Fradley have collaborated with al\-Shabaka, a New York\-based Palestinian policy network regarding their work on the US Kyl\-Bingaman Agreement \(KBA\). According to the Managing Director of al\-Shabaka, their US Policy Fellow ‘ *found the work compelling and important, she began exploring ways to work with Drs. Fradley and Zerbini on the issue and to advocate for policy change in the US through writing and outreach*’ \[ **E8**\]. This resulted in a ‘ *widely\-read commentary and*  [*policy memo*](https://al-shabaka.org/memos/the-us-law-restricting-satellite-imagery-of-palestine-israel/) *on the subject – and later a longer*  [*policy brief*](https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/maps-technology-and-decolonial-spatial-practices-in-palestine/) *that also addressed the KBA’* \[ **E8**\]. She goes on to testify that in her 2018 appearance at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \(NOAA\) committee \(responsible for the oversight of the KBA\) she ‘ *posed questions put together in partnership with Dr. Fradley*’, who also attended in\-person. After an initial rejection in 2018, al\-Shabaka maintained pressure and was ‘ *also able to seek help from interested parties in the US Congress to further challenge NOAA*’. In July 2020, the NOAA announced it was changing its policy, saying ‘ *satellite imagery of Israel is readily and consistently available from non\-U.S. commercial sources. The Department has therefore changed the existing resolution limit of 2.0 m GSD to 0.4 m GSD*’ \[ **E9**\]. The ready availability of non\-US commercial sources was one of the key findings of **R6**, and a key component of al\-Shabaka’s policy engagement publications. The NOAA’s response aligned with all of the recommendations made by **R6**. 

 The relaxation of this restriction allows much greater visibility of sites on the ground, allowing the identification of more sites and better assessment of threats to them. By allowing greater access to cultural and heritage sites, this overturning also represents a significant change for human rights monitoring in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Major NGO Human Rights Watch have confirmed the significance of this change, with the Israel and Palestine Director saying *‘Human Rights Watch across the world uses satellite imagery both to help document and to illustrate grave human rights abuses…the lack of high\-resolution imagery has inhibited us from doing this sort of work in Israel\-Palestine. We welcome the reform of the Kyl\-Bingaman Amendment, which we understand in part grew out of the research and campaigning of Zerbini and Fradley at the University of Oxford, as it offers the possibility to enhance our reporting on Israel\-Palestine’* \[ **E10**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 
The Andean religious and cultural heritage has been understudied and its importance has been unfairly downplayed. This is for two interrelated reasons: ethnic groups in Peru, such as the Chanka Indians, lack access to their own religious history; and Andean forms of communication, ‘khipus’, have been disparaged as not being ‘true writing’, while, their sacred nature has been overlooked. Prof. Sabine Hyland’s research on the religious history of the Peruvian Chanka Indians, resulting in the first historical ethnography of them, **\(1\)** **helped to recover and valorise Peru’s religious and cultural heritage, and led to the establishment of the Chanka Museum in 2016, which is used by local Chanka people to learn about their history**. Sabine and William Hyland's research on the Andean system of writing with knotted cords, ‘khipus’ \(which includes the first partial decipherment of a khipu text\) has transformed how this Andean form of communication is understood. It was thought to have been merely a memory aide; by advancing decipherment, we showed that it was actually a complex writing system. Our research **\(2\) has been incorporated into the Peruvian school curricula, reaching over 485,000 people \(Peruvian students\) to date, teaching children about their ancestors’ intellectual achievements.** Our research has also **\(3\) demonstrated how khipus can continue to function as sacred texts in modern Andean villages, such as Collata.** In Collata, a translated copy of our publication has been placed in their sacred archive. Additionally, our khipu discoveries have received international media coverage, and thereby **\(4\)** **increased public understanding of Andean religious and cultural achievements worldwide.** The story of our khipu decipherments has been carried by major news outlets, such as *The Times*, *The Daily Express*, and *All About History* magazine. Our research was featured in *Discover* Magazine \(October 2017\); in a cover article in *New Scientist* \(September 2018\); and in an interview for the BBC World Service show, Outlook. Prof. Sabine Hyland also appeared in two Discovery Channel documentaries to discuss our khipu decipherments.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The religious and cultural achievements of the native peoples of the Andes have often been undervalued and denigrated. Our research addresses this issue by writing the first historical ethnography of the Chanka nation, revealing the impact of colonial Spanish priests and religion on their cultural institutions; and by making advances in deciphering the khipus, the knotted cord Andean system of communication, demonstrating that it was an actual writing system and not just a memory aide. 

 Prof. Hyland published the first history and ethnography of the Chanka Indian nation **\(R1\)** based on extensive archival and ethnographic research, revealing for the first time the complexities of Chanka culture, and the effects of colonial religious institutions on the people. The research revealed the rule of one Spanish priest whose legacy had repercussions on the Chankas’ yearly festivals and their kinship structures into the 18<sup>th</sup> century and beyond **\(R1\)**. In regard to the khipu writing system, Hyland’s research has made, for the first time in 100 years, a series of five key advances in khipu decipherment and philology: it has deciphered the meaning of knot direction in khipus **\(R2\)**; deciphered the significance of ply direction in khipus **\(R2\)**; deciphered the two most common colour patterns in khipus **\(R3\)**; discovered and partially deciphered the first phonetic Andean khipus ever known, demonstrating that the colourful cords represented syllables and could even tell a story **\(R5\)**; and analysed the ways in which khipus are sacred texts and played an integral role in religious festivals **\(R4, R5** and **R6\)**. 

 The appreciation of the Andean religious and cultural heritage has been hindered, in part, by a lack of research on regional groups, such as the Chanka of Andahuaylas, Peru, whose history – particularly their colonial religious history – has been entirely ignored. The Chanka have been stereotyped as brutal ‘savages’ and they have been described pejoratively as ‘bellicose warriors’ in Peruvian textbooks for schoolchildren. Respect for Peru’s spiritual and cultural heritage has also been hindered by the lack of understanding of the nature of the Andean communication system of knotted cords known as ‘khipus’. Most scholars have claimed that Andean khipus were not writing, but merely simple memory aides, implying a low level of intellectual achievement for native Peruvians. The khipus' sacred nature as religious texts in the remote Andean villages that retain them has also been overlooked. Our research has demonstrated previously unknown ways in which Spanish missionaries employed khipus to teach Christian catechisms and other religious texts **\(R4, R5** and **R6\)**. The phonetic khipus that we have studied in the village of Collata are believed to express the sentiments of the local mountain deities.  We are the first researchers to demonstrate how khipus are integrated as sacred texts in Andean life. Deciphering Andean khipus enriches our understanding of Andean religion and culture. 

 Our research **\(R1\-R6\)** has contributed to the recovery of Peru's religious and cultural heritage in two ways: first, by uncovering the colonial religious history of the Chanka people, and second by advancing the decipherment of khipu writing, disproving the dominant view that they were merely memory aides, and demonstrating the role of modern khipus in Andean religious beliefs.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 Our research on the first historical ethnography of the Chanka nation and the khipus, the knotted cord Andean system of communication, has \(1\) helped to recover and valorise Peru’s religious and cultural heritage; \(2\) led to our research being incorporated into the Peruvian educational curriculum; \(3\) demonstrated how khipus can continue to function as sacred texts in modern Andean villages, such as Collata; and \(4\) increased public understanding of Andean religious and cultural achievements worldwide. 

 **1\) Our research has helped to recover and valorise Peru's religious and cultural heritage.** 

 Prof. Sabine Hyland’s book on the Chanka nation **\(R1\)** has given Chanka Indians a better understanding of their religious and cultural heritage, a heritage which typically has been disparaged in Peruvian history textbooks. The Andahuaylas Minister of Culture and Commerce wrote: *‘publication of “The Chankas and the Priest” represents a watershed moment for us in Andahuaylas \[home of the Chanka nation\]….For the first time we see our Chanka ancestors humanised; in their actions, we can see ourselves. No longer just ""enemies of the Inka"" or ""bellicose warriors"", Professor Hyland's research and publications have given us a fuller sense of who we are as a people, and the importance of valorizing, perserving and celebrating our cultural heritage'* **\(S1\)**. 

 Our research on the Chanka Indian nation **\(R1\)** resulted in the establishment, in the city of Andahuaylas, Peru, in 2016, of the  [Chanka Museum](https://www.facebook.com/museochankalamas/). The museum features Chanka history displays based on our research where local people learn about their history and spiritual heritage **\(S1\)**. For bringing the voice of the ancient Chanka, their ‘own’ history, to their present\-day ancestors, the Chankas have made Prof. Sabine Hyland ‘ *an honorary Andahuaylina who contributes to the cultural, academic and economic life of this region in significant and long\-lasting ways*’ **\(S1\)**. 

 **2\) Our research has led to changes in the Peruvian educational curriculum to improve religious and cultural awareness.** 

 Our project's discoveries have been incorporated into Peruvian educational curriculums at the **2i\)** national \(the Peruvian Ministry of Education\); **2ii\)** regional \(Cuzco regional government\); and **2iii\)** local \(Collata village school\) levels. 

 **2i\)** After seeing the international media coverage on our khipu discoveries, the Peruvian Ministry of Education asked Prof. Hyland in 2017 to fact\-check and provide photos for an online classroom lesson about our research which the Ministry subsequently prepared for schoolteachers throughout Peru. Titled ‘Our khipus astonish the world’ \( [http://www.perueduca.pe/estudiantes/especial\-del\-mes/nuestros\-quipus\-siguen\-asombrando\-al\-mundo](http://www.perueduca.pe/estudiantes/especial-del-mes/nuestros-quipus-siguen-asombrando-al-mundo)\), this lesson has been accessed by Peruvian school teachers 17,444 times to date, reaching over 485,000 people \(Peruvian students\) and thus approximately 20% of the total number of secondary school children in Peru \(25 August 2020; the website maintains a counter that records only when teachers access the site\). Teachers share comments on the site. Here are four indicative examples: ‘ *How important this article about khipus \[is\]; as teachers we must know more about our ancestors so that we can teach the next generation about our history so that it is never forgotten’* \(28/03/18\); ‘ *Interesting lesson\! What a marvellous legacy our ancestors have left to us... this is a very beautiful subject to discuss with our students’* \(27/03/18\); ‘ *We as teachers need to know more about this topic to teach our students and to call attention to the lives of our ancestors, so that when we make comparisons with other societies, we are not left behind’* \(18/01/19\); ‘ *A great contribution to discoveries about our ancestors, and a great legacy for future generations*’ \(18/01/19\) **\(S2\)**. 

 **2ii\)** In 2015, the Cuzco Province's Ministry of Culture learned about Sabine Hyland's research from a National Geographic documentary about her work \(Decoding the Incas\) that aired in Peru in Spanish. They then asked Hyland to write an article about her khipu discoveries. The Cuzco regional government \(population 2,000,000 people\) prepared and printed this publication at their expense about our khipu discoveries for all the provincial schools and libraries as a resource for teachers and students \(15,000 copies\). The Ministry of Culture in Cuzco wrote, ‘ *\[your research\] has greatly expanded our understanding of the value of the cultural heritage of the Andean people*’ **\(S3\)**. 

 **2iii\)** When community leaders in the Andean village of Collata saw Peruvian newspaper stories about our research on their khipus, they asked Professor Hyland for a copy of the Current Anthropology article **\(R5\)** which triggered the media interest. She provided the article, which they translated, and is now included in the curriculum of the local school. As a village leader wrote, ‘ *We want our children to understand the value of their cultural heritage*’ and therefore ‘ *they need to know about your discoveries about our past*’ **\(S4\)**. 

 **3. Our research has demonstrated how khipus function as sacred texts in modern Andean villages, such as Collata.** 

 The native leaders of the Andean village of Collata placed their translation of our article **\(R5\)** in their sacred archive. This archive consists of a wooden chest that also contains the khipus and colonial documents that serve as the basis of their religious and ceremonial life. The archive is hidden in an underground chamber of the church, indicating the sacred nature of these khipus **\(S5\)**. Village authorities now include a formal consultation of the article in the annual ceremony to install village officials responsible for local religious festivals. Villagers believe that the khipus express the concerns of the mountain deities; when the council of elders decided to show the khipus to us, the first outsiders ever to see them, the mountains signalled their approval by the fact that vicuñas \(one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes\) appeared in the surrounding peaks for the first time in decades. Our partial decipherment of the khipus is thought to please their ancestors and bring prosperity to the community **\(R4, R5**, and **R6\)**. 

 **4\) Our research has increased public understanding of Andean religious and cultural achievements worldwide.** 

 Until Hyland's khipu research, it was thought that Andean Indians had not possessed writing; our research has demonstrated that khipus were a complex, often phonetic form of writing. When our article **\(R5\)** was published, the story was picked up by different news outlets, many of which requested interviews with Sabine Hyland for both print media and radio. Our discovery and partial decipherment of the first phonetic khipu ever found made international news, and was carried by over 11 major news outlets between 2017 and 2019, including *The* *Times* \(circulation 437,352\) and the *Daily Express* on 21 April 2017 \(circulation 397,236\) **\(S6\)**; and a featured interview in *All About History* magazine, October 2019 **\(S7\)**. The story was carried by media in the US, UK, France, Italy, China, Japan, Poland, and Peru; in a feature article in the *Discover Magazine*, October 2017 \(circulation 582,276\) **\(S8\)**; in a cover article in *New* *Scientist,* September 2018 \(circulation 124,623\) **\(S9\)**; and in an interview for the BBC World Service show, Outlook \(‘Deciphering the messages left by the Incas’\), August 2018. Prof. Hyland also appeared in two Discovery Channel documentaries, *Unearthed: Machu Picchu* \(aired July 2017\), and *Unearthed: Inca Cusco* \(aired October 2018\), to discuss the research. In the first *Unearthed* documentary, Prof. Hyland analysed a khipu in Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum and in the second she disseminated her research on Catholic missions in Peru. According to Altmetric, the *Current Anthropology* article \( **R5**\) had an attention score of 92% and was in the top 5% of all research outputs scored by Altmetric **\(S10\)**.

# 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Research at Heriot\-Watt University \(HWU\), within the Edinburgh Research Partnership in Engineering \(ERPE\), has developed, patented and demonstrated a way to extract the protein from the pot ale by\-product residue of malt whisky production and transform it into feed\-stocks for aquaculture. The impacts arising include: 

 \(A\) Creation of spinout company Horizon Proteins Ltd \(HP\) in 2014, to exploit the new bio\-technology, described as ‘game changing’, supporting rural circular economies and showcased by government at Milan Expo 2015; 

 \(B\) Investment of circa GBP 5,000,000 \(2018\) towards exploiting research and the planning and construction start of HP’s first manufacturing plant, creating skilled jobs for the rural economy \(plant construction completion is delayed due to COVID\-19, the new plant has been designed and engineered to treat 200,000 tonnes of pot ale per annum\); 

 \(C\) Conversion of whisky by\-product residue to new HP feed\-stock for aquaculture resulted in a 600% increase in the asset value of the residue; 

 \(D\) Strategic partnership with EWOS Cargill for business\-to\-business supply chain of HP feedstock for salmon producer market; 

 \(E\) Environmental benefits in reduction of the chemical oxygen demand to treat the waste and using local sourcing for aquaculture feedstock, rather than using imports. 
","
# 1.  Underpinning research 

 Every year, the Scottish whisky industry brings in around GPB 5 Billion in export revenue but produces over three billion litres of pot ale, a residual by\-product that is very challenging to dispose of. For decades, the distilling industry has been striving to develop synergy through increasing both economic and environmental sustainability. The salmon aquaculture industry, which supports 2,300 jobs directly, requires secure supplies of affordable, sustainable, high quality protein feed ingredients to realise annual export revenues of around GBP 800 Million. 

 Driven by the challenges both diverse industry sectors faced, the ERPE researchers, led by Prof Willoughby, started the investigation in 2011 of the potential of converting this residual by\-product from the whisky industry into a high quality protein feed that could serve the aquaculture sector \(e.g. the salmon industry\). This would support a strategically important rural economy sector.  The research was multi\-inter\-disciplinary, involving Engineering & Physical Sciences, Biological Chemistry, Biophysics and Bioengineering, Mechanical, Process and Energy Engineering. 

 The research challenges for the needs of both whisky and aquaculture industries were paramount in terms of the early underpinning research involving: integration with existing architecture; utilising only currently used \(and food\-safe\) materials; zero impact or perceived impact on whisky production \(exports to 175 countries and directly supporting 10,000 jobs\); and the process must first and foremost be economically and environmentally sustainable \[3.1, 3.2\]. 

 The key underpinning research was to overcome the challenge of accessing and recovering soluble protein from pot ale. As a protein resource, this was previously poorly utilised due to the inability to find a viable extraction process. From a small research project in early 2011, initial feasibility results showed promise in reversible adsorption of protein to low cost solid\-phase adsorbents. This led to funding being secured from Scottish Funding Council in late 2011 \[P1\] for a postdoctoral researcher and the commencement of a PhD project. 

 The early research work built on both the initial findings and Willoughby’s research background in developing therapeutic protein purification processes, while the postdoctoral side of the project focused on the commercial aspects, sustainability and life cycle analysis. The research findings resulted in a viable full process for recovery of protein components of value, with the critical finding \[3.3\] being the ability of the developed process to reversibly bind over 80% of the protein content of pot ale to a solid phase adsorbent, under normal pot ale discharge conditions. This protein can then be recovered as a pure solution, concentrated and dried \[3.4\]. Solid phase adsorption is a widely applied pharmaceutical and water treatment technology and is robust and easily scalable, but had never previously been used reversibly in\-situ to recover usable protein. 

 The alternative protein processing approach, involving reversible binding and recovery of therapeutic and pharmaceutical\-grade protein, is commonly carried out by ion exchange chromatography. The adsorbents used in these processes, however, are far too expensive to be economically sustainable in the pot ale process, and their size and lack of rigidity would result in operationally challenging pressure drops in large scale columns. 

 Central to this technology was to identify a food\-grade adsorbent that is widely available and economically viable. In addition, this adsorbent must have a high protein binding capacity, to ensure the process was viable at scale, and must have an open, microporous and rigid structure to ensure operational robustness and low pressure drops at scale. After testing a number of solid phase candidates and identifying several promising possibilities, the research then moved into designing and validating a process with end\-routes for all product and by\-product streams \[3.5, 3.6\]. 

 The success of the early project in developing a viable protocol allowed securing of further funds in 2014 from Scottish Enterprise for translational research within ERPE \[P2\]. This allowed the research team to design, develop and manufacture a processing plant capable of treating pot ale on\-site at distilleries; this plant was used for trials in 2015 and 2016 to improve understanding of processing conditions and to seamlessly integrate with current distillery architecture, as well as to produce enough protein to enable larger scale feed trials in Salmon in 2016/17. Further funding from the Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre \(IBioIC\) supported research exploring the broader potential of the technology within the grain whisky, grain spirit, US rye and bourbon processes \[P3, P4\] 

 The work was further supported via an RSE Enterprise Fellowship \(2016\) to better understand the commercial potential of the protein product in feed and food sectors. 

 The positive results in both the salmon trials and the demonstration of the process operating in distilleries allowed the commercialisation of the technology at this stage, with the IP being licenced to Horizon Proteins by ERPE in 2016, and then fully assigned in 2020.

# 1.  Details of the impact 

 The impacts arising from the underpinning ERPE research are parallel increases in economic and environmental sustainability in strategic key rural industry sectors, both the whisky and aquaculture industries. A range of impacts have resulted \- involving local, national and international platforms supporting business development and key policies and strategies of the circular economy. The key impacts are as follows: 

 **\(A\) New Spinout Company: Horizon Proteins Ltd \(HP\)** 

 ERPE staff decided in 2014 to commercialise the emerging process and develop the research further via a spinout company. Funding was secured through Scottish Enterprise’s elite High Growth Spinout Program \(HGSP\) to support the applied research transition. Horizon Protein Ltd \(HP\) was registered as a company in 2014 \[5.1, 5.2\] and full operations of the spin\-out company commenced in 2016.  ERPE staff and HP subsequently identified a route to economically separate the protein and Scottish Enterprise awarded GBP575,000 assistance \[5.2\], along with GBP138,000 industrial support, to refine the process in collaboration with distillers and aquafeed manufacturers \[5.3\]. At the announcement of the funding for HP, Eleanor Mitchell, Director of Commercialisation at Scottish Enterprise, said: "" *We are very excited to be supporting a project with the potential to not only create high value jobs in Scotland but to also provide such significant value\-add to the iconic Scottish food and drink industries, salmon and whisky*"". 

 By adapting techniques more commonly applied to high\-value pharmaceutical products, HP developed the unique, cost\-effective separation and extraction process \[5.3\]. Ultimately, it has managed to transform a historically underused by\-product and increased the sustainability of various distillery processes \[5.3\]. 

 In June 2015, a key report into the Circular Economy involving a ‘Sector Study: Beer, Whisky and Fish’ by Zero Waste Scotland, Scottish Government, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and enterprise agencies, cited Horizon Proteins \(HP\) 24 times in the document. HP was described as a key example of a circular economy ‘ *could offer a game\-changing opportunity’* \[5.4\] coupling both whisky and salmon industries for the important ‘ *meaningful contribution to rural economies’*, with the ‘ *pot ale by\-product* *sector valued at GBP80,000,000 being a realistic market sector value*’ \[5.4\]. The report further stated that HP is a ‘ *key development*’ and ‘ *a bonus as pot ale is in less competition with the cattle feed markets than draff. It may also offer a potential solution for smaller or isolated distilleries: Horizon Proteins is developing a form of their technology designed to operate at smaller scales’*. 

 In 2015 Horizon Proteins were invited by Scottish government to showcase their pioneering circular economy approach for the food and drink by\-product sectors at the Milan Expo 2015 \[5.5\]. In 2016, HP was a case study cited in a Mayor of London report ‘Circular and Sharing Economy’, by Arup Associates, as an industry example of converting organic waste to proteins \[5.6\]. 

 **\(B\)  Joint venture with Rothes CoRDe to build HPL Manufacturing Plant** 

 Further key investment was raised in 2018, as a result of HP being engaged with the top two companies \(Diageo and Pernod Ricard\) producing more than 60% \(by production volume\) of Scottish whisky output. Funding of GBP4,000,000 was raised to support the construction of Horizon Proteins’ first manufacturing plant, as a joint venture with Rothes CoRDe Ltd, on their site in Rothes, Scotland \[5.7\]. Funders included SiccaDania Venture \[5.8\], Danish high\-net\-worth individuals and the Scottish Investment Bank. 

 **\(C\)  New Production Plant \- £4m investment supporting rural economy and jobs** 

 The construction process for this plant is underway \(<ins>delayed due to COVID\-19</ins>\) and will initially be able to treat 200,000 tonnes of pot ale per annum to produce around 2,500 tonnes per annum \(tpa\) sustainable protein from pot ale, expanding in 2023 to full capacity of 1 Million tpa of pot ale and 12,000 tonnes tpa of sustainable protein. This plant has been designed to produce revenues of GBP 2.25 Million initially, rising to GBP 11.25 Million at full capacity. 

 EWOS Cargill have agreed to purchase all of the initial protein, with a specific Scottish salmon farming customer as the first key client \[5.9\]. The construction of this plant will create around 10 skilled jobs in the Speyside rural area associated with the plant, as well as supporting in\-direct supply chain roles \(transport etc.\). 

 **\(D\) Economic Added Value** 

 The Horizon Proteins research project was designed from inception to maximise economic impact for rural areas and ERPE staff engaged key stakeholders from the whisky, aquaculture and feed industries as an advisory panel to guide direction. Researchers engaged with the whisky industry through the Scotch Whisky Research Institute \(SWRI\) and the major trade body the Scotch Whisky Association \(SWA\), to ensure that all distillers had an input. The three major aquafeed manufacturers in Scotland, EWOS Cargill, BioMar and Skretting, were all involved in the project during its development and all three offered to carry out commercial trials of the final product. Through this early engagement, ERPE and HP ensured that the commercial impact pathway of the developed process was maximised. 

 Extraction of this protein transforms the accessible value of these liquid waste by\-products.  They are worth around GBP 3/tonne as pot ale sold as syrup, but this increases to GBP 20/tonne, when reconstructed into the Horizon Proteins dried products, resulting in an over 600% increase \[5.3\]. 

 **\(E\) Environmental Benefits** 

 The HP process enables a reduction in the chemical oxygen demand \(COD\) to treat the waste and reduces the needs for imported \(non\-UK sourced\) aquafeed. The technology is now seen as a crucial element in the development of a circular bioeconomy and specifically ‘upcycling’ in Scotland \[5.4\]. The technology reduces environmental pollution, allows for re\-use of water, lowers by\-product processing costs and provides a sustainable source of protein for fish for a growing global population \[5.1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Great Writers Inspire \(GWI\) and Writers Make Worlds \(WMW\) are web\-based Open Educational Resource platforms designed by the English Faculty and IT Services. GWI enhanced study of English at secondary level and above, providing curated resources for teachers, students, educational services and lifelong learners, informing A\-level guidance, and supporting learning during lockdown. A fantasy theme deepened fan communities’ appreciation of classic texts and remediations. WMW, a companion site, launched 2017, aided curriculum diversification, guiding understanding of how new Black and Asian writing is changing English literature. Beneficiaries included school literacy co\-ordinators using WMW to shape learning challenges within multicultural environments. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 30\+ Faculty researchers have added material to GWI in the REF period, on topics ranging from Anglo\-Saxon to contemporary global English—supporting the site’s mission since 2012 to engage secondary school teachers, students and life\-long learners with ideas and questions galvanising university\-level research. Some contributions rest on general expertise; many present new critical work, including Thomas on the vernacular poetics of Beowulf; Ashe on the birth of Romance in England; Leneghan on King Alfred; Brewer on the methodology behind creation of the *OED*; Ballaster on an unfinished play by Maria Edgeworth; McDonald on ideas of the state and communities of letters. 5 Faculty researchers have contributed new critical and biographical research to WMW. 

 Three contributions are highlighted: 

 **Smith’s ‘Approaching Shakespeare’ GWI podcasts** draw on a range of methodologies developed in her early publications—from *Five History Plays* \(2000\) to *Macbeth: Language and Writing* \(2013\). Asking why Hamlet is called Hamlet, for instance, enabled her to develop the history of character and psychological criticism; investigating where the political sympathies of Richard II might lie draws on new bibliographical work and on the history of performance; working with the unnecessary character of Antonio in *Twelfth Night* was a way to engage in a nexus of queer criticism, historicism and theatre. Her more recent contributions to GWI focus on textual criticism and history of the book, integrating materialist work with other critical approaches, especially performance criticism and theatre history. 

 A **GWI ‘Fantasy literature’ theme** draws on **Larrington’s** *The Land of the Green Man* \(2015\), exploring the folktale corpus of the British Isles in relation to land, gender, life and death, work, humans and animals, children and the future of the planet. Analysis of 19th\- and early 20th\-century county and regional folktale collections expanded the corpus, identifying and analyzing folklore motifs underpinning modern books and films from *Harry Potter* to Hayao Miyazaki. Writers examined include Irvine Welsh, Ted Hughes, A. S. Byatt. 

 **The Writers Make Worlds website** emerged from **Boehmer’s** research, expanding the critical conversation about postcolonial British writing beyond an old canon dominated by Rushdie and Naipaul. **Indian Arrivals** \(2015\) sheds light on intercultural contacts between Indians and Britons on British soil at the height of empire, as reflected in a range of fiction, poetry and life\-writing. A chapter on Indian involvement in the First World War underpins the WMW page on Kamila Shamsie. **Postcolonial Poetics** \(2019\) showed why writing in English from various 21st\-century contexts, including southern and West Africa, and Black and Asian Britain, requires revised imaginative understanding of the English literary ‘world’. Close analysis of Okri \(Chs 2, 3\), Philip, Shire, D’Aguiar \(Ch 4\), Evans \(Ch. 6\) et al. casts light on resistance, reconciliation, survival after terror and migration, underpinning WMW webpages on these writers including contributions by graduates \(e.g. Haith\). Ch. 7, on ‘Spoken Word Poetry’, guided the site’s Performance strand. An article on ‘Black British Publishing’ \(2018\), co\-written with Postdoctoral Fellow Erica Lombard, spotlighted the significance of Bernardine Evaristo, underpinning her WMW page.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Great Writers Inspire \- GWI \(est. 2012\) has **brought free online literary\-critical resources to school age and adult learners around the world,** providing **a recognised model for accessible, curated open education**: ‘Notable among the technology approaches adopted … is …. syndication of recordings and metadata by RSS feeds’. Fed by the University’s podcast service \(podcasts.ox.ac.uk\) which in turn is aggregated by services including Apple iTunes and Spotify, the site achieves ‘wide circulation’ \(A. Lane, *Emancipation through Open Education*, 2017\). \[5.1.i\] With technical and visual updates enhancing tablet and mobile usability, GWI had **2,089,678** **unique page views and 1,443,530 visitors** between 15 July 2015 and 11 December 2020. Average usage was 8,345 unique page views per week. 68% of users were female, nearly half in the 18\-24 age range. Top countries of origin were the **US 42%; UK 15%; India 9%.** \(Data from IT Services, 11.12.20.\) 

 The site has **supported the UK core curriculum for English literacy**. A top\-performing essay page, ‘The Lost Generation’, is a set ‘performance task’ addressing Common Core State Standards for ‘citation of textual evidence, identification and analysis of salient themes, …development of valid written analyses and arguments’ \(G. Berry, *Cultivating Adult Literacy*, 2017\). \[5.1.ii\] GWI has **aided learning of key critical and political concepts**, with ‘Feminist Approaches to Literature’ the second most visited essay page \(‘a lifeline of a site’—UK secondary student\). It has **supplied specialist resources** \(‘Just \[what\] I wanted’, UK undergraduate researching smallpox in literature\) \(site survey feedback\) \[5.2\] and **assisted non\-academic professionals needing reliable literary sources**, e.g. an Irish Tour Guide trainer. The varied formats have **enabled study of English in the absence of formal support** \(‘I use them often for independent learning’—US student, with no set British literature\) and **provided stimulus for home\-schooled students** \(‘Me and my partner are doing a sort of ""booth"" on Mysticism and Animals’ for Shakespeare: ‘This really helped a lot\!’\). GWI **provided vital support for students around the world during the 2020 COVID lockdown** \(‘Such wonderful resources that you are offering now during the pandemic’—1<sup>st</sup>\-year Indian undergraduate\) \[all feedback in 5.2; selected examples of institutional use at 5.1.v\] 

 Smith’s podcasts, the single most popular site section, have **supported secondary teaching and improved student engagement with Shakespeare**. Recommended by AQA Student Books for English Literature A and B \[5.1.iii and iv\], promoted by the School Library Association and English Media Centre, they are a recognised resource on school and HEI reading lists globally: ‘Accessible … for the non\-specialist public AND advanced scholarship’ \(Folger Library\); \[5.3.ii\] ‘I listen over and over’ \(U.S. Masters student\) \[5.3.i\]; ‘my teacher mentions your podcast perhaps twice a lesson … \[Could you\] sign a photograph of yourself \[to\] put … in his office?’ \(grammar school A\-level student\). \[5.3.iii\] See selection of uptake examples \[5.3.iv\] **Prisoners and tutors on the Emory University, Atlanta ‘Shakespeare in Prisons’ programs have been helped** in the programs’ ‘mission **to bring Shakespeare to incarcerated populations \[and\] instil vital skills for social re\-entry’**: ‘Approaching Shakespeare’ **provided ‘trusted expertise’**, accessible ‘from diffuse time zones and environments’ \(program tutor\). \[5.4\] Linked podcasts recorded by TORCH during lockdown **were an alternative to live theatre** *–* \(‘If yo\[u\] … just feel like you’ve been grounded … listen to … Emma Smith’, *Evening Standard\)* \[5.5.i\] —e.g. ‘Shakespeare and the Plague’, 19 June: **138,024 Facebook feeds, 4,257 YouTube views over 18 days.** \[5.5.ii\] 

 A recently\-added Fantasy theme, co\-designed by Lee \(English/IT\-Services\) and Larrington, drew together existing Oxford iTunes podcasts by Faculty researchers and added new material. Launched 21 May 2020, the site has **engaged fan communities with literary and historical research and promoted creative remediations**. Since October 2020, the original podcasts have also been aggregated in Spotify, accruing 347 ‘starts’, 213 ‘streams’ to date, and 105 followers world\-wide \(50% female/46% male\) with relatively even spread across age groups. \[5.6.i\] Theme users are guided to an introductory podcast ‘Approaching Fantasy Literature’ \(Lee\), then to talks on authors and collections, including recordings by writers and critics at Oxford’s Summer School on Fantasy Literature \(2018\) assisting connectivity to their fan bases. Contributions by Larrington draw on sources uncovered in *Land of the Green Man* and creative interpretations generated for a 5\-part BBC Radio 4 series *The Lore of the Land* \(2015\). Her prior public engagement work with fan communities, including a Hag podcast series of Audible books, 2019, Virago short\-story collection, and trade book \(2015\) exploring the medieval sources of *Game of Thrones* \(3,200 copies sold by mid\-2019\) \[5.6.ii\], helped drive engagement with the site. Larrington’s tweet launching the GWI theme received **10,823 impressions and 449 engagements \[**5.6.i\], adding to Lee’s 5,189 impressions, 108 engagements. \[5.6.iii\] Students, creative writers and fans report **enhanced understanding of genres and topoi and an enlarged sense of the canon**: ‘cool to find out about connections between the Middle English romances and the Icelandic sagnakvæði’ \(student respondent to Modern Fairies podcasts\) \[5.7.i\]; ‘I highly recommend \[Larrington’s\] ‘Wolves and Winter’ for anyone who enjoys reading fantasy’ \(award\-winning Sci\-fi novelist/critic\) \[5.7.ii\]; ‘wonderful’ site, ‘placed … on my home page’ \(US general interest reader\) \[5.2\]. The most popular content to date has been Larrington’s Sylvia Townsend Warner essay \(announcement tweet 3,999 impressions, 205 engagements\) \[5.7.iv\] and the 10 ‘Modern Fairies’ iTunes podcasts \(1,015 downloads, 587 streams, by 13 December 2020 \[5.7.iii\]; 5,406 twitter impressions and 107 engagements by 14 December 2020\) to which the Fantasy theme acts as a portal. \[5.7.iv\] 

 In October 2017, GWI was enhanced by the launch of Writers Make Worlds \(WMW\), dedicated to British Black and Asian writing. WMW has **modelled and supported curriculum diversification and outreach at secondary and tertiary level, providing new resources** **on 45 BAME British authors**: 42 critical commentaries on individual texts/authors, 20 original video podcasts of writers in conversation. Four sections treat Approaches to Reading, Reading and Reception, Identifying with Literature, Performance and Reading, with curated links to writers’ blogs, interviews and secondary material. Audience reach was aided by public readings and interviews, social media activity and a launch article in *The Conversation* \( **16,783 reads**; widely read and republished in, especially, India\). \[5.8\] Since launch, WMW has had **80,171 total pageviews, 43,181 unique visitors** from over 180 countries, including Syria, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Nigeria. 36.2% of visitors were 18–24 years old; 42.16% 25–44 years old. **19.3% were returning users**. 

 WMW has **improved resourcing for curriculum diversification in schools and universities**. Content with the highest pageviews correlates to performance genres, writers in the media, and critical issues in teaching and creative practice. The popularity of essays on high\-profile writers—V. S. Naipaul, 3,363 views; Andrea Levy, 898; Kazuo Ishiguro, 871—is outstripped by interest in authors whose reputations are not yet matched by resource provision: Warsan Shire, 7,394 views; Moniza Alvi, 1,681; Helen Oyeyemi, 1,200; Patience Agbabi \(added January 2020\), 948. A concept essay ‘Identifying with Literature’, focusing on representation and invisibility in markets and classrooms, was a top\-performing page \(2,923 views\), indicating strong interest in syllabus widening and ‘decolonial’ debates \(IT\-services data\).  **Educational support organizations have benefitted from this bridging resource between school and university English**. The English and Media Centre ‘Studying English at University’ webpage recommends WMW as: ‘a brilliant site offering resources and ideas to support developments in diversifying the English curriculum … \[it\] will give A Level students a great idea of what’s happening … at university level’. The Centre Director promoted the site to AL & GCSE teachers by Twitter, May 2019 \(94 likes; 53 retweets\) \[5.9.i\]. Indicative school and LEA take\-up includes Astrea 6<sup>th</sup> Form Academy; St Neots \(p.15\) \[5.9.ii\]; and Hampshire English Home Learning \(HIAS\). \[5.9.iii\] Secondary, tertiary, and post\-HE readers have been **galvanised to study writers previously unknown to them** \(‘reading the essay about Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie \[…\] has inspired me to read more of her writing and to further study postcolonial literature’—UK undergraduate; ‘re\-educative’—Indian general reader\) \(feedback via GWI survey\). \[5.2\] 

 **WMW has helped school literacy co\-ordinators adapt learning targets to multicultural environments**: a Lead Practitioner for Academic Literacy/Oracy in Bristol, tweeted WMW as a ‘Reading on challenge’ \(for ‘a white teacher on a wholly white teaching staff which does not represent the demographic of our cohort, what work needs to be done to recognise and represent diversity in English?’\) \[5.10.i\]; another literacy lead at Key State 3 found ‘exactly the kind of resource I’m looking for … pushing to decolonise & improve our curriculum’ \(Twitter\). \[5.10.ii\] Teacher feedback also indicates **benefits to** more confident **students pursuing independent projects**: ‘many’ preparing for the Cambridge Pre\-U 3,500 word essay ‘gravitate towards what we loosely call postcolonial writing, … I always point them towards that website … accessible as well as inspiring … a great resource’ \(Teacher, Harris Westminster Academy\). \[5.10.iii\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research on North Sea oil tax, led by Professor Kemp at the University of Aberdeen \(2005\-2019\), was instrumental in informing major reviews by the UK Treasury and underpinning key decisions made by both the Scottish and UK Governments regarding the UK Continental Shelf \(UKCS\), including introduction of Transferable Tax History \(TTH\) to support late life field asset transactions. Furthermore, Kemp’s research underpinned acknowledgement by the Oil and Gas Authority \(OGA\) that the investment hurdles for the UKCS should take into account significant capital rationing and its impact on investment decisions in the UKCS. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For two decades, the UKCS has been regarded as a mature petroleum province, presenting commercial challenges as well as opportunities. The OGA and Industry act to mitigate barriers to investment in UKCS to create attractive active investment opportunities. Since 2014, capital rationing has had a serious impact on resource renewal. Large companies concentrate on the perceived best opportunities, but many smaller undeveloped fields present economic challenges to both large and small licensees. As a result, fewer new fields are being developed, and at late 2019, there were over 400 undeveloped discoveries, many of which were small. In that year, exploration and new field developments were at historically low levels. 

 Professor Kemp, a world authority on North Sea economics, is highly regarded by industry and government for his insightful and high\-quality research, confirmed by his continuing research sponsorship from both industry and government organisations. Professor Kemp’s work has been recognised: in 2006, by the award of an OBE for services to the oil and gas industry; and in 2011, he was appointed as a member of the Independent Oil and Gas Expert Commission by the Scottish Government and as a member of the Scottish Energy Advisory Board chaired by the First Minister, a position he continues to hold. In 2012, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Petroleum Engineers \(SPE\) and, in 2016, he became the first person to be inducted into the North Sea Hall of Fame at the Aberdeen Press and Journal Gold Awards. 

 In 2005, Professor Kemp and colleagues, Sola Kasim and Linda Stephen, provided key research findings concerning the economic trajectory of the North Sea oil and gas industry, demonstrating that the UKCS had already entered its mature phase, with new fields being relatively small and the taxable capacity correspondingly smaller. The tax arrangements, however, did not recognise this major change \[1, 2\] but was evidenced by major operators “retreating” and a reducing number of attractive opportunities for new entrants to invest in the UKCS. 

 In 2014, HM Treasury \(HMT\) published the “Driving Investment Plan” outlining the principles HMT follow when developing UKCS fiscal policy including “to be consistent with the objective of maximising economic recovery as new projects become ever more marginal, the overall tax burden will need to fall as the basin matures”. During this period, Professor Kemp and colleagues produced a body of work relating to “capital rationing”, restricting the amount of new investments or projects undertaken by a company. This research produced valuable evidence to suggest that, in order to secure maximum economic recovery \(MER\), reduced headline tax rates plus targeted investment allowances were vital to stimulating investment in new fields and incremental projects in mature fields \[3\]. Furthermore, such action would facilitate the selling of oil and gas fields to new entrants with plans to enhance production and investment. Professor Kemp’s research into tax problems relating to late field life transactions found that, these could be inhibited by inadequate relief for decommissioning costs. He demonstrated that changes to tax legislation to permit the Transfer of Tax History \(TTH\) when an asset transaction took place would facilitate such deals and thus enhance economic recovery \[4\]. 

 Kemp and Stephen produced evidence showing that capital rationing had become an endemic feature of the operating environment in the UKCS. Evidence was produced that investment hurdles reflected this, and taxation policies also needed to acknowledge this phenomenon \[5, 6\]. This research on the future of the North Sea oil industry and the need for tax reform was received with interest by the Treasury and by other influential organisations between 2014\-2018 including: the Energy Institute; Citizens’ Jury on Energy, organised by Judge Business School, University of Cambridge; and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research at the University of Aberdeen, led by Professor Kemp and colleagues Linda Stephen and Sola Kasim has provided valuable, impartial evidence to inform the long\-standing debate on North Sea oil economic and taxation issues, which have impacted the growth, decline and diversity of the UKCS. From 2005\-2014, key research published by Kemp, Kasim and Stephen highlighted the looming problem of maturity and the need to re\-engineer the tax system to be more relevant for smaller fields with lower materiality and thus lower taxable capacity, affecting economic recovery, job security and investment. Their research highlighted the likelihood of falling future production, modest levels of exploration activity, limited numbers of new field developments and increasing numbers of undeveloped proven discoveries. The Scottish Government published “UK Continental Shelf Tax Regime – Options for Reform”. This referenced Professor Kemp’s major contribution to thinking on the subject and his influence continued through his appointment as a member of the Scottish Government’s independent Oil and Gas Expert Commission. Their report, published in 2014, was entitled “Maximising the Total Value Added \(including the supply chain\)”. This emphasis has been increasingly recognised by the Scottish Government and the OGA in recent years. 

 In late 2014, the UK Government acknowledged the problem outlined by Kemp and his team and issued a review of the oil and gas fiscal regime on the possible long\-term tax structure \[S1\]. This included reference to the need to reduce effective headline rates and to introduce investment allowances to facilitate maximum economic recovery, as outlined by Kemp and colleagues. Professor Kemp was asked to give a presentation entitled “Modelling the Future of the UKCS” to a visiting group to Aberdeen from HMRC/HMT/DECC in August 2014. In 2015, the Investment Allowance for supplementary charge \(SC\) was introduced by the UK Government, and in 2016, the rate of SC was reduced; both changes were based on Kemp’s findings \[S2\]. 

 HMT subsequently instigated a consultation on the possibility of a Transfer of Tax History to facilitate late life asset transactions. Kemp and Stephen produced evidence that, in the absence of TTH, late life asset transactions could be inhibited because the remaining return \(net present value\) to the prospective seller could exceed the prospective return to the buyer due to ineffective tax relief for decommissioning costs. When the Treasury was studying the evidence on the case for Transfer of Tax History, HMT representatives visited Professor Kemp on 31<sup>st</sup> July 2017 to discuss his submission on the subject. The Treasury acknowledged Professor Kemp’s contribution and Transfer of Tax History was subsequently enacted. In 2018, a TTH mechanism was introduced for UK oil and gas producers, for deals that complete on or after 1 November 2018, allowing companies selling UKCS oil and gas fields to transfer some of their tax payment history to the buyers of those fields \[2\] \[S3\]. 

 During this period of transition, Kemp and his team’s research informed key debates in the House of Commons \(2015\-2016\). Kirsty Blackman MP stated that, based on Kemp’s research, the proposed changes did not go far enough to facilitate the development of the many marginal fields \[S4\]. Hannah Bardell MP \[S5\] also supported the view expressed by Professor Kemp on two separate occasions stating that further reforms were clearly necessary \[4\]. Mike Weir MP in the House of Commons expressed support for a reduction in the SC as suggested by Professor Kemp \[S6\]. 

 Further evidence of the impact of Professor Kemp’s and his team’s research was the invitation by the House of Commons Committee on Scottish Affairs for him to provide written and oral evidence relating to their inquiry on “The Future of the Oil and Gas Industry”. His written evidence, was sent on 5<sup>th</sup> June 2018, entitled “The future of the UK Oil and Gas Industry”, Memorandum to House of Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, and he was invited to give oral evidence. “The future of the UK Oil and Gas Industry”, Oral Evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on Scottish Affairs was published on 25<sup>th</sup> June 2018. His views on future prospects were quoted in the report of the Committee published on 4<sup>th</sup> February 2019 “The future of the Oil and Gas industry”; Sixth Report of Session 2017\-19. 

 In 2017, the OGA produced a consultation on what constitutes “a satisfactory expected return” in the UKCS. Kemp and Stephen undertook a study to examine OGA’s proposed discount rates and investment hurdles \[S7\] and their findings pointed to the need for discount rates to be higher than OGA’s suggested levels. They also emphasised the importance of capital rationing in the industry and the need for it to be considered as a central element in understanding investment hurdles. The OGA, post\-consultation, agreed that discount rates in the range suggested by Professor Kemp were realistic. The OGA also agreed that use of the ratio NPV/I to determine hurdle rates was also appropriate \[S8\-9\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 University of Bristol \(UoB\) research has led to the recovery of cultural heritage during commercial archaeological investigations, through its pioneering development of **organic residue analysis \(ORA\)**. Archaeological analysis has been legally required in the UK as a part of all commercial developments since the early 1990s and has proved to be a significant source of new cultural heritage. However, historically important heritage has been lost as commercial investigations have not routinely analysed organic residues such as fats, resins and waxes, on artefacts which can provide unique insights into human diet, agriculture and other cultural activities. UoB researchers created the methodology for the use of ORA and, with support from Historic England, have driven its rapid uptake and integration into mainstream commercial archaeology. Since 2017, over 60 major commercial projects in the UK and overseas have used ORA analysis to provide many new insights into our past. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Over the last two decades, the UoB team led by Professor Richard Evershed FRS, has pioneered the application of ORA techniques to archaeology. Their ground\-breaking work has demonstrated the widespread survival and utility of the biomolecular components of organic residues in revealing hitherto unobtainable insights into human foodways, technologies and ritual practices. Key achievements include: 

-  Development of all the analytical chemical protocols, based on state\-of\-the\-art gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry, routinely used to study archaeological lipid biomarkers in organic residues<sup>1,2</sup>. 

-  Demonstration of the survival of lipids at sites of deposition for thousands of years in association with all of the major classes of organic remains, including:  pottery<sup>1\-6</sup>, soils and sediments<sup>1</sup>, human<sup>1</sup>, animal and plant remains<sup>1,4,6</sup>. 

-  Establishing interpretative frameworks built around fundamental studies of organic residue formation, pathways of degradation during burial, together with systematic investigations of chemical and isotopic compositions of modern plants and animals exploited by ancient peoples<sup>1,2</sup>. 

-  Performing experimental archaeological investigations to underpin the understanding of how lipid biomarkers survive in ancient contexts and how they can be used to provide new archaeological information, while taking account of chemical degradation or technological modification of plant and animal products of diverse origins<sup>2</sup>. 

-  Extensive demonstrations of how lipid biomarkers can provide information on vessel use and diet. Biomarkers in soils and sediments have been used to investigate inputs into ancient rubbish dumps, disused watercourses, latrines and cesspits, and manures in human impacted soils<sup>1</sup>. 

-  Amassing extensive experience in the design and management of archaeological projects, embedding ORA as part of wider archaeological investigations<sup>4\-6</sup>. 

 The underpinning research performed by the Bristol group is contained in >200 papers, many of which appear in the highest profile peer\-reviewed journals. Notable discoveries using ORA have included: 

-  The earliest direct evidence for milk use >8000 years ago in the near East, linked to the evolution of lactase persistance<sup>5</sup> 

-  Association of the honeybee with early farmers of Europe dating back nearly 9,000 years<sup>4</sup>. 

-  The first detection of plant processing in pottery from the Early Holocene period in North Africa, dating back >7,000 years<sup>6</sup>. 

-  Development of a new high precision compound\-specific radiocarbon dating tool for archaeology<sup>3</sup>.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In the early 1990s the UK Government made it a legal obligation that when significant archaeological artefacts were found during building projects, archaeological assessments <ins>must</ins> be undertaken. At this time scientific analytical techniques, except for radiocarbon dating, were rarely employed. The widespread adoption of ORA by developers, driven by the UoB group and the increased cultural heritage information generated has changed substantially the practice of commercial archaeology in the UK and is now increasingly becoming used across Europe \[A\]. We document below how ORA techniques have been widely adopted by the commercial archaeology community and illustrate how major cultural heritage finds in the UK and internationally have followed, as a consequence of UoB research. 

#  \(I\). Creating awareness in the commercial sector 

 In 2014 Evershed and Cramp approached Historic England **\(HE\)**, as the public body charged with looking after England’s historic environment, with the idea of developing a guidance document for commercial developers. The aim was to make archaeological professionals aware of the potential of ORA for generating new cultural insights during post\-excavation assessments. HE strongly supported the concept as biomolecular signals are widely preserved at archaeological sites and a rich source of information relating to the human past was, at that point, being lost. 

#  
Development of best practice for archaeological professionals 

 In 2015, Dunne drafted detailed guidance for commercial archaeologists in the use of ORA for the protection of cultural heritage. This guidance was formally adopted by HE in 2016 and published as two freely downloadable pdfs \[B\]. Co\-designed with other expert groups, including the Medieval Pottery Research Group, Prehistoric Ceramics Research Group and academic practitioners of ORA at the Universities of York and Bradford, the guidance has become accepted as best practice by the commercial archeology community and has now been downloaded over 3500 times since publication \[A\]. 

#  Training sessions to promote awareness of ORA in the commercial sector 

 In 2017, Evershed and Dunne led a series of training sessions throughout the UK, organised and funded by HE, to promote the guidance to archaeological and heritage professionals. They were attended by more than one hundred delegates, including Archaeological Planning Officers from 21 county councils, representatives from the major UK commercial archaeological units \(Wessex Archaeology, Museum of London Archaeology \(MOLA\), Oxford Archaeology\), leading heritage organisations \(National Trust, Vindolanda Charitable Trust, New Forest National Park Authority, Rubicon Heritage, Somerset Heritage Trust\) and curators from Bristol City Museum and the National Museum of Wales. These training events were enthusiastically received, with the commercial archaeology professionals present remarking on the hitherto unappreciated potential of ORA for their work, e.g. *“I ..came away with a much better understanding of organic residues and more aware of the benefits of carrying out such analysis.”* \[C\] and *“The Organic Residues and Pottery Production guidance will be added into our specifications for archaeological fieldwork and I will ensure that it is included in contractors Written Scheme of Investigation \(WSIs\)”.* \[C\] 

#  \(II\). Commercial deployment of ORA at over 60 UK sites since 2017 

 ORA has become a powerful new tool in the commercial archaeology community. To enhance the cultural benefits to stakeholders we have developed a commercial ORA service at Bristol. Recognizing our unique expertise, this is used by all major commercial archaeology units within the UK including: Wessex Archaeology, MOLA, Oxford Archaeology and other organisations including HE and the National Museums of Scotland and Ireland \[D\]. As a result of these training sessions \(II\) more than 60 commercial projects have been commissioned and completed \[E\]. This volume of work has led us to employ a dedicated full\-time chemical analysis technician to carry out commercial analyses, with Julie Dunne acting as commercial manager, liaising with customers, interpreting results and writing reports for each project \[E\]. 

#  \(III\). Enhancing Cultural Heritage 

 ORA is now yielding an abundance of new discoveries revealing the rich cultural history of the British Isles and Europe. Notable recent examples include: 

#  Dating the first farmers in prehistoric London to nearly 6,000 years ago 

 
Excavations carried out by MOLA during the commercial redevelopment of the new Amazon Building in Shoreditch yielded an assemblage of pottery which provided the earliest evidence of Early Neolithic farming in London. ORA showed dairy products were processed in the pots. Jon Cotton, a consultant prehistorian working for MOLA commented *“Organic residue analysis of this remarkable collection helps to fill a critical gap in London’s prehistory. Archaeological evidence for the period after farming arrived in Britain rarely survives in the capital, let alone still in\-situ. This is the strongest evidence yet that people in the area later occupied by the city and its immediate hinterland were living a less mobile, farming\-based lifestyle during the early Neolithic period”* \[F\]. The discovery generated widespread media and public attention \[F\]. 

#  Locating Medieval Oxford’s Jewish community 

 
Excavations in the historic heart of Oxford \(undertaken by Oxford Archaeology\) yielded remarkable evidence of 11<sup>th</sup>\-12<sup>th</sup> century houses. Forensic\-style ORA of pottery from the site revealed an absence of pork\-derived chemicals which, together with assessments of animal bones, confirmed the presence of Oxford’s early medieval Jewish community, later expelled from England by Edward I. Investigations focussed on individual Jewish houses and showed for the first time the power of ORA to reveal the religious dietary practices of the occupants. Senior project manager for Oxford Archaeology, noted *“Archaeological remains of the Jewish Quarter up til then had been very limited, and so the results of the residue analysis, which looked for traces of adherence to Jewish dietary laws, offered rare and stunning evidence”* \[Db\] *.* This work \[G\] was featured in *Current Archaeology*, the popular archaeology magazine read by over 45,000 people monthly and was nominated for the Current Archaeology ‘rescue project of the year’ award \[H\]. 

#  Investigating the use of intricately decorated Bronze Age pottery vessels found across Ireland’s monumental megalithic landscape 

 
Lipid analysis was carried out for the National Museum of Ireland on their remarkable collection of putative ‘Food Vessels’, notable because each vessel is decorated differently. Found in cist and passage tomb burials across Ireland, they have long been believed to have served some distinct purpose. ORA of 20 vessels showed all were used to process dairy products, such as milk, butter and cheese, demonstrating their specialist function. Evidence for milk production and processing is especially important in Ireland as animal bones rarely survive in the acid soils, so pots offer the only means of revealing ancient dairy practices. 

 These examples demonstrate how our commercial ORA projects, which have ranged from identifying ancient lamps at the Scottish Iron Age Broch at Clachtoll, Assynt \[Ia\] through to Bronze Age ‘fridges’ in Somerset \[Ib\] have generated widespread media attention and public interest \(online articles and videos in The Independent, The Times, Smithsonian Magazine, YouTube and others \[J\]\). ORA has ultimately enhanced the social and economic value of heritage assets and tourism across the length and breadth of the British Isles and beyond.

 The use of schools and university buildings by military forces is harmful for students and staff in armed conflict zones and renders them vulnerable to attack by opposing forces. In partnership with the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack \(GCPEA\), Haines, University of Greenwich chair of Public International Law, has produced International Guidelines for the use of military forces to help reduce the military use of schools and universities.  These have now \(31 December 2020\) been endorsed by 106 States, have obtained wide support within the United Nations \(UN\) and have been praised by several influential world leaders.  Importantly, they have also been adopted by a number of Armed Non\-State Actors active in current Non\-International Armed Conflicts \(NIACs\). The Guidelines have made a significant contribution to reducing the use of schools and universities during armed conflicts, as exemplified in Yemen, for example, which had 160 reported incidents in 2015 but only just over eighty by 2018. They have also influenced the African Union’s Peace and Security Council and the European Commission who called for their members to abide by the Guidelines’ contents.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Students and education staff have been killed, injured and traumatised, and school and university buildings damaged and destroyed during many armed conflicts that have occurred in recent years. Girls and women have been particularly targeted because of their gender, not only as victims of sexual violence but also by armed groups opposed to female education. In addition, the use of schools and universities for military purposes by either side in a conflict has often prevented students from accessing education and rendered the buildings targets of attack by opposing forces.  This became such a significant feature of particular concern to civil society organisations and UN specialised agencies that they began to seek ways of mitigating its worst effects.  In 2010 responding to such concerns, a number of UN agencies \(UNICEF, UNHCR, UNESCO\) and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) from fields such as education \(eg Education Above All\), child protection \(Save the Children\) and human rights \(Human Rights Watch\), established the GCPEA and charged it with working towards reducing military use of educational facilities.  The military use of schools, not itself invariably unlawful, deprives educational institutions of protected civilian status under IHL and renders them vulnerable to legitimate attack. 

  

 To assist with this work, in late\-2011/early\-2012 GCPEA sought the advice and participation of a military and legal specialist.  It approached **Steven Haines**, whose background and ideas seemed ideally suited to the role the Global Coalition envisaged such a specialist fulfilling.  **Haines’s** prior expertise in International Humanitarian Law \(IHL\) had been built on years of experience, both theoretical \(including teaching in the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights and chairing the Editorial Board of the UK’s official *Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict* – OUP, 2004\) and practical \(he was previously a serving senior officer in the UK’s Armed Forces who had deployed into the Balkans and into Sierra Leone towards the end of its civil war in 2001; he had also worked within the Central Policy Staff in the UK’s Ministry of Defence\). 

 This knowledge and experience has enabled **Haines** to play a leading and influential role in the drafting of the *Guidelines on the Protection of Schools and Universities from Military Use in Armed Conflict*, work that he has undertaken since his appointment at the university in October 2012. 

 During preliminary discussions with GCPEA representatives in Geneva in 2012, **Haines** identified the need for ‘soft law’ guidelines for use by military forces in zones of armed conflict.  The soft law guidelines are termed as such by not in themselves being legally binding, by not generating new binding legal obligations for States, and being more easily and effectively crafted than an equivalent instrument of conventional law.  This approach was geared entirely to be most effective in reducing the use of schools and university buildings by military forces and, thus, to reduce the likelihood of them being regarded as military objectives subject to legitimate targeting by opposing belligerent forces.  For such guidelines to have real impact, they would need to be potentially effective in practice but also of a nature that States and Armed Non\-State Actors \(ANSAs\) would be prepared to adopt/endorse them. Too great a restriction placed on military forces’ lawful options in armed conflict would deter them from supporting and adopting guidelines with that in mind. 

 The specialist legal and military understanding **Haines** possessed meant that he fully appreciated that guidelines that met the remit would require a subtlety of approach based on both a sound understanding and interpretation of the relevant law and an appreciation of relevant military and official approaches to normative development. **Haines** was chosen by GCPEA to lead the production of suitable guidelines that would be acceptable to those who would be invited to adopt them.  His methodology for determining the fine points of the guidelines was to produce an initial draft which he would then expose to a critical process of review by an appropriately constituted ‘focus group’ of military and government officials, specialist lawyers, civil society representatives \(including those representing interests of ANSAs\), representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross \(ICRC\).  The ICRC’s involvement was vital for international legitimacy, given its role as the guardian of IHL. \(see  [https://www.icrc.org/en/document/safe\-schools\-declaration\-and\-guidelines\-protecting\-schools\-and\-universities\-military\-use](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/safe-schools-declaration-and-guidelines-protecting-schools-and-universities-military-use) for their position on the Guidelines\). 

 **Haines** produced the initial draft in October 2012, in advance of a workshop consisting of the invited ‘focus group’ convened at Chateau Lucens in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, in November 2012.  Between that workshop and May 2013, **Haines** developed a total of four iterations of the guidelines, each robustly critiqued by the ‘focus group’.  He arrived at the final version, agreed by consensus within the group, in June 2013.  It was regarded by all concerned as a pragmatic and innovative document that identified a militarily reasonable approach to tactical decision\-making in relation to the use of schools. While not imposing any additional legal restraints on military forces’ use of schools, it did suggest ways in which the negative effects of such use might be mitigated for ultimate military and societal advantage.  The result was a document that could be applied by the armed forces of States as well as members of the fighting forces of ANSAs.  It was generic, in being applicable in both International Armed Conflicts \(IACs\) and NIACs.  The guidelines were fully compliant with existing IHL.  The default source was 1977 Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions but the guidelines were also checked for compliance with Additional Protocol II and with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.  The resultant document was brief \(6 guidelines over two pages of A4\), easily understood by military forces, allowed for pragmatism in application, and has proved to be readily adoptable by policy decision\-makers in government.  The first two guidelines cover military use itself, guidelines 3 and 4 deal with precautions and approaches to attack when this proves necessary, the 5<sup>th</sup> deals with the security and protection of schools by military forces, and guideline 6 covers the means of promulgation within military forces. 

 The final version was published by GCPEA in July 2013 as *The Draft Lucens Guidelines on the Protection of Schools and Universities from Military Use in Armed Conflict* **\(3.1\)** and was used for successful advocacy within Geneva, being adopted by the Norwegian and Argentine Missions to the UN.  Both States jointly launched the Guidelines internationally at an all\-States diplomatic conference in Oslo in May 2015. They form the core of the *Safe Schools Declaration* \(SSD\), which is a document devised under Norwegian Foreign Ministry auspices as a diplomatic vehicle for the Guidelines.  The endorsement of the SSD is the means by which States signal their endorsement of the Guidelines themselves. The SSD was drafted for the specific purpose of international advocacy for the Guidelines. 

 In 2014, **Haines** wrote a brief account of the production and purpose of the *Lucens Guidelines* **\(3.2\)**, published by GCPEA.  However, a full account of the process of developing the Guidelines has since been published **\(3.3\)**. This provides a full narrative account of the production of the Guidelines, the methodology used in their drafting, their incorporation in the SSD and the impact that they have had at both the diplomatic and operational/tactical military levels.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The immediate output of the research conducted between October 2012 and June 2013 was the *Lucens Guidelines* **\(3.1\)**. This document was published on the GCPEA website \(see  [Safe Schools Declaration and Guidelines on Military Use – Safe Schools Declaration \(protectingeducation.org\)](https://ssd.protectingeducation.org/safe-schools-declaration-and-guidelines-on-military-use/)\) and also reproduced in hard copy for wide dissemination to governments and militaries worldwide. The Guidelines are the route to a range of high level international diplomatic and military impacts. 

 **More than 100 States have endorsed the Guidelines produced by Haines.** Since its launch in 2015, 106 States have endorsed the Guidelines/SSD. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry is the official depository for State endorsements and the up to date list is reproduced on the GCPEA website at:  [Endorsement – Safe Schools Declaration \(protectingeducation.org\)](https://ssd.protectingeducation.org/endorsement/) . There has been substantial engagement with the Guidelines, principally within the UN system, with a number of UN Security Council open debates \(on Children and Armed Conflict\) as well as General Assembly debates featuring calls for the Guidelines to be universally adopted.  The engagement has often been at the highest level, with the then French President Hollande personally announcing French endorsement in 2017 **\(5.1\)** and the UK’s then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson announcing UK endorsement at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference in 2019 **\(5.2\)**.  The former prime ministers of Australia and the UK \(Julia Gillard and Gordon Brown\) have also championed the Guidelines internationally **\(5.3** and **5.4\)**.  While this demonstrates an impressive international profile for the Guidelines – and certainly encourages endorsement by a steadily increasing number of States – what really matters is the extent to which they are having an effect during conflict, on the ground where it actually matters the most. The Guidelines and the SSD are now reviewed formally every two years at international diplomatic conferences hosted by different States.  The First Safe Schools Conference was the launch conference in Oslo hosted by Norway in 2015, which was addressed by Ziauddin Yousafzai \(Malala’s father\) \( **5.8**\).  The Second was hosted by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence of Argentina in Buenos Aires in 2017 \( **5.9**\).  The Third was hosted by Spain in Palma, Mallorca in 2019 \(with the closing address delivered by Her Majesty Queen Letizia of Spain\) \( **5.10**\). 

 **The Guidelines have made a significant contribution in the decrease of schools and universities being used by the military during armed conflicts.** In October 2019, GCPEA published an account of the *Practical Impact of the Safe Schools Declaration* **\(5.5\)**. This report was based on substantial and significant data provided principally by UN agencies, NGOs and the media, as well as by States. It showed that the majority of reported incidents of military use of schools and universities had declined between 2015 and 2018 in the totality of States that had both endorsed the SSD in 2015 and experienced armed conflict during the same period: Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Iraq, Kenya, Lebanon, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan. It is important to note that this data capture concentrated on States that had endorsed the SSD/Guidelines in 2015 and, for that reason, neither Syria nor Yemen were included in the survey. Yemen did subsequently endorse the SSD in Oct 2017, however, and in 2019 the Group of Experts on Yemen informed the Human Rights Council in Geneva that “ *sources reported that the Yemeni armed forces have commenced to withdraw from some schools as per the commitments taken under the Safe Schools Declaration* **\(5.6\)**.” Additionally, the Yemeni Ministry of Education established a Safe Schools Committee in 2018 and overall, reported incidents in the country had halved \(near 160 in 2015 to just over 80 by 2018\). 

  

 **The UN stopped using educational institutions for military purposes and started to promote and adhere to the Guidelines.** The Lucens Guidelines **\(3.1\)** had been presented to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in June 2013 \(two years before their official launch in Oslo in 2015\) and, since then, UN treaty bodies have made frequent recommendations on strengthening protections for schools from military use. These had focused on sixteen States in all, including the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, and Thailand. In June 2015, a month after the official launch of the SSD, and again in July 2018 the UN Security Council had encouraged all member states ‘to take concrete measures to deter the use of schools by armed forces and armed groups. By the time of the launch, the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations had already developed a child protection policy banning the use of educational facilities by peacekeepers. When **Haines** first became engaged with GCPEA in early 2012, he was aware that the UN had routinely used abandoned schools for UN force purposes. He had himself witnessed the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone using a school as a reception base for disarming child soldiers.  Forces on UN operations today, however, are under an obligation to promote and adhere to the *Guidelines*; GCPEA has stated that there have been no reported incidents of UN military forces using schools or universities since early 2017, per their Impact Report of Oct 2019 **\(5.5\).** 

 **High\-level UN officials have frequently expressed support for the SSD/Guidelines.** They include UN Secretary\-General António Guterres \(who urged all States to endorse the SSD/Guidelines in his 2018 and 2019 annual reports on Children and Armed Conflict\); the Secretary\-General’s Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Virginia Gamba  \(who regularly calls for endorsement of the SSD/Guidelines and conducts bilateral advocacy with States to encourage endorsement and implementation\), and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein \(who recommended endorsement in his OHCHR report on Protecting the Rights of the Child in Humanitarian Settings\) **\(5.5\).** 

 Furthermore, the SSD \(containing the Guidelines\) has been highlighted during a number of UN Security Council Open Debates on the Protection of Civilians, on Children and Armed Conflict, and on Women, Peace, and Security, as well as at the Human Rights Council. GCPEA estimates that around fifty States delivered approximately 230 individual statements in these contexts positively referencing the SSD between 2017 and 2019 **\(5.5\).** 

 **The Guidelines have also had an impact on distinguished organisations in Africa and Europe.** The African Union’s Peace and Security Council has welcomed the SSD/Guidelines,  urging all AU member States to endorse and strengthen support for the Guidelines, and called on members to ‘comply with International Humanitarian Law and ensure that schools are not used for military purposes’. In its first ‘Education in Emergencies’ policy communication, the European Commission has voiced support for the SSD/Guidelines, announced that the European Union ‘will support initiatives to promote and roll out the SSD’ and acknowledges that military use of schools increases violence in educational settings, negatively affecting access to education **\(5.5\).** 

 **The momentum from the guidelines continues**. Five years after their launch, in May 2020, the UN General Assembly voted unanimously to set 9 September annually as the UN’s International Day for Protecting Education in Armed Conflict, a decision inspired by the Guidelines and the SSD.  A UN Security Council Open Debate on Children in Armed Conflict took place the day after the first of these was marked in 2020, in which the guidelines were highlighted as a significant development for ensuring protection of education in conflict situations going forwards **\(5.7\).**  For further corroboration of Haines’ contribution in bringing these impacts to this point, see **5.11.**

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Ongoing research in structural materials characterisation at Swansea University has enhanced the understanding of the mechanical behaviour of proprietary gas turbine engine components. Internationally recognised expertise has allowed for progression of new materials towards service and extended safe operation of in\-service components. Swansea research has attracted GBP4,600,000 of direct investment from Rolls\-Royce and has delivered critical technological solutions towards the manufacture of efficient and robust engines. Significant savings exceeding GBP3,500,000,000 has been achieved by Rolls\-Royce through reduction of component costs and safe life extension of critical rotating components.  Research performed by our team at Swansea University, as part of a larger collaborative effort, contributed to a 1% reduction in specific fuel consumption of Rolls\-Royce engines, leading to significant reduction in aerospace CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and enabling Rolls\-Royce to maintain a minimum 50% share in the global civil aviation market. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Reduction of carbon emissions from gas turbine engines is mainly achieved through reduction in weight or increases in operating temperature that increase thermal efficiency. Development of materials for these arduous operating conditions can only be validated through mechanical characterisation which allows for the declaration of safe operating lives of components. Swansea University is a University Technology Partner \(UTP\) within the framework of Rolls\-Royce University Technology Centres \(UTC\) that aims to support the company through a network of leading institutions. Examples of Swansea University’s ongoing expertise in this area, which contribute to impact for Rolls\-Royce are detailed below. 

 i\) **Titanium alloys** 

 Swansea University is a leader in the study of “cold dwell sensitivity” in near\-α titanium alloys, where extended periods under stress at low temperatures can cause premature fatigue failures. Cold dwell sensitivity was first acknowledged from the in\-service failure of Rolls\-Royce RB211 fan discs in the 1970s. Research undertaken at Swansea \(Prof Bache\) determined that the combination of anisotropic crystal plasticity and stress redistribution was attributed as the pre\-requisite for quasi\-cleavage facet formation and dwell\-induced failures. A series of seminal academic papers **\[R1\]** and keynote presentations at international conferences resulted. 

 The application of electron backscattered diffraction for measuring fracture surface crystal orientation and facet inclination was pioneered at Swansea and further developed for industry in 2010. The “Evans\-Bache” model which describes quasi\-cleavage facet formation, has been applied since 2000 to a range of alloys and has underpinned the exchange of coarse\-grained alloys \(e.g. Ti685, Ti829\) as compressor disc materials for alternatives \(Ti6\-4, Ti834, Ti6246\). As Swansea’s University Technology Partnership \(UTP\) Director, both Prof Bache and Prof Evans have provided independent, confidential scrutiny for titanium technologies including fan blade manufacture, stress concentration features in compressor discs and interpretation of fatigue crack initiation and growth in titanium metal matrix composites. 

 Research conducted under an EPSRC grant **\[G1\]** along with private venture \(PV\) funding **\[G2\]** married fundamental materials knowledge to non\-linear, strain\-based life prediction modelling procedures applied to Ti6\-4 fan disc material and Ti6246 compressor disc material. Similar PV\-funded studies, led by Prof Bache, focused on the Ti6246 compressor disc alloy **\[G3\]**. Two major collaborative EPSRC projects **\[G4, G5\]** assessed the processing/texture/property relationship and benefits of laser shock peening, respectively for the titanium alloy Ti6\-4. Parallel postgraduate programmes in 2011 characterised the fatigue behaviour of novel titanium alloys \(Ti\-639, Ti575\) for civil engine fan systems **\[R2\]**. 

 ii\) **Component design and safety** 

 Unrivalled testing facilities, in terms of scale and capability, to characterise constitutive behaviour and damage tolerance have underpinned advanced algorithms used to declare safe operational lives for Class “A” safety critical components. Such life prediction techniques encompassed intimate knowledge of creep\-fatigue\-environmental interactions. 

 Longstanding expertise in creep has been extended, superseding the “Theta” creep models with the “Wilshire Equations” after 2005. Prof Whittaker has applied the latter to various titanium, nickel, steel and intermetallic alloys, improving predictive capability in each case, specifically through extrapolation of limited data sets to extended conditions **\[R3\]**. As core partners in the EPSRC Strategic Partnership in Structural Metals for Gas Turbine Applications **\[G6\]**, Prof Whittaker, Dr Lancaster and Prof Bache extended modelling of creep behaviour to include thermo\-mechanical fatigue regimes and high\-temperature dwell crack growth **\[R4\]**, also incorporating novel work on thermo\-mechanical fatigue crack growth **\[R5\]**. Additionally, a suite of unique experimental facilities for the characterisation of hot corrosion informed compressor and turbine disc life prediction methodologies after in\-service sulphidation pitting \(Dr Perkins\). Parallel research \(between 2005 and 2020\) into a range of service critical issues was funded by Department of Trade and Industry \(DTI\)/Technology Strategy Board \(TSB\)/Innovate UK \(IUK\)/Aerospace Technology Institute \(ATI\) contracts exceeding GBP6,000,000 in value. Much of this research was directed towards nickel superalloys, especially RR1000 **\[R5\]**, feeding proprietary codes used to design recent engine variants, such as Rolls\-Royce’s Trent 1000/XWB. 

 iii\) **Novel materials** 

 Early creep and fatigue research \(Prof Bache\) into ceramic matrix composites \(CMCs\), encompassing silicon nitride, silicon carbide and alumina\-based systems, has been conducted with the aim to develop commercially viable CMC aero\-engine components. Notable projects include a study to establish a UK processing capability for oxide\-oxide CMCs **\[G7\]**, evaluation of fatigue and thermo\-mechanical fatigue of silicon carbide fibre/silicon carbide matrix CMCs **\[G8\]**. Additionally, influential research on the processing and properties of additive structures \(titanium, steel and nickel variants\) spawned international expertise in the field of miniaturized test techniques and joining of high\-performance materials. More specifically research into solid state welding processes for bladed disk \(blisk\) applications through has been implemented for titanium\-based alloys for compressor disc applications \(Dr Jeffs\) **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As one of three major international manufacturers with an underlying revenue exceeding GBP15,000,000,000 \(as of 2018\), Rolls\-Royce supplies approximately 50% of the global large civil aeroengine market. Over 4,000 Trent engines are currently in service \(including the 900/1000/7000/XWB engines\) and this number is projected to increase to around 7,500 by 2030. Swansea’s research into the mechanical characterisation of metallic alloys and ceramics provided significant and tangible impact, enabling the definition of safe operational envelopes for various titanium and nickel alloys utilised in fan, compressor and turbine applications across the Trent fleet. 

 Swansea academics contribute to confidential, non\-advocate company reviews. ‘Red\-Top’ investigations are used to assess issues relating to the processing and safe operation of engine components. Within the REF period \(between 2014 and 2020\), as an expert non\-advocate reviewer Prof Bache supported a major review between 2016 and 2019 into cold dwell related in\-service experience, life prediction models and laboratory validations and scrutinised the implementation of academic understanding of hot corrosion into company protocols. In particular, the review of cold dwell led to a revised processing route for the disc alloy Ti834 in 2014, which had commercial impact through the increased competitiveness of disc components. The work by Bache was also referenced in the 2020 Bureau d’Enquetes et d’Analyses \(BEA\) Accident Report of an AIRBUS A380\-861 \(https://www.bea.aero/fileadmin/uploads/tx\_elydbrapports/BEA2017\-0568.en.pdf\) **\[C1\]**. 

 Swansea’s expertise has led to Rolls\-Royce’s direct investment between 2014 and 2020 exceeding GBP4,600,000 and involvement as a core member in the second phase of the EPSRC Rolls\-Royce Strategic Partnership in Structural Metallic Systems for Gas Turbines \(between 2014 and 2019\). This programme was set up with the clear aim that, through fundamental research, it would provide the foundation for next\-generation aero\-engines that, running hotter or faster than current designs, deliver significant improvements in engine efficiency and environmental impact  Furthermore, Swansea’s research has led to a spin out company, Swansea Materials Research & Testing Ltd \(SMaRT\), incorporated in 2009 **\[C2\]**, which greatly increased experimental capacity \(approximately three fold in terms of test frames\) for the research team at Swansea. This expansion proved to be a major factor in facilitating much of the impact described below. 

 Through the development of this unique partnership between Swansea University and Rolls\-Royce, Swansea’s research has been transferred to Rolls\-Royce and their key supply chain companies. Critical research undertaken at Swansea has led to technological contributions to the manufacture of efficient and safe gas turbines, which include the following examples: 

-  Swansea’s research into thermo\-mechanical fatigue crack growth **\[R5\]**, contributed to the safe life extension of disc materials. As described by the Project Manager for Universities within Rolls\-Royce: 

 “*Life extension has allowed for revision of disc service intervals from 3,600 cycles to 4,000 cycles. Over the lifetime of the engine this leads to a reduction in overhauls from 10 to 9 \(around £1M in spares and labour costs per overhaul\). The number of Trent 900/1000/XWB engines delivered in the REF period \(since 2013\) exceeds 3,500, therefore providing an approximate £3.5b ongoing cost avoidance over the lifetime of these engines.*” **\[C3\]**. 

-  Swansea has also worked closely with Rolls\-Royce strategic suppliers on the fundamental understanding of new titanium alloys **\[R2\]**. The research supports the wider application of titanium alloys for life cycle cost reduction and component optimisation. To quote a Rolls\-Royce titanium specialist: 

 “*A new alloy has been implemented in 2017 as part of an improved fan system, realising a cost reduction of \~£25k per engine.*” **\[C4\]**. 

-  Investigations into solid\-state welding processes for bladed disks \(blisks\) **\[R6\]** led to a cost avoidance of GBP250,000 per blisk component from 2014 due to refined safety tolerances in assessing weld process data concessions **\[C5\]**. 

 It is recognised that the combined University Technology Centre \(UTC\) portfolio has had significant impact on gas turbine emissions *.* 

 *“The research conducted directly by Swansea on industrially related programmes combined with the UTC UK portfolio has enabled Rolls\-Royce to deliver over 1% reduction in specific fuel consumption \(SFC\). This 1% reduction has translated into reductions in the millions of tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> being emitted into the atmosphere.”* Head of Capability Acquisition – Materials, Rolls Royce **\[C6\]**. 

 This represents significant environmental and economic impact given that the aviation sector accounts for 9% of UK energy consumption and Rolls\-Royce supplies approximately 50% of the global large civil engine market. Since the ongoing goals of the industry are to improve efficiency and reduce emissions through higher operating temperatures, Swansea’s input through all stages of the engine manufacturing process has contributed to the volumes of sulphur\- and nitrogen\-based emissions being progressively reduced, meeting objectives set by international government agencies \(such as ACARE 2020/FLIGHTPATH 2050\). 

 The Trent 7000 model features a decrease of 10% in SFC compared to the Trent 700. However, the increased temperatures required to improve thermal efficiency places significant demands on existing alloys, as they are expected to operate beyond their original design limits. A detailed understanding of the role of microstructure on fatigue has allowed rationalisation amongst modelling procedures allowing for safe life extension through reduction of overly conservative safety factors.  Swansea has underpinned novel alloy development \(i.e., RR1000\) **\[R4\]** by characterising mechanical behaviour at continually increasing temperatures and subsequently evaluating in\-service findings, both of which allow the company to manufacture fuel efficient engines and remain competitive in terms of engine sales, by using this alloy, which is currently employed in over 4,000 in\-service Trent engines **\[C6\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Galligan’s research on women’s political representation played an important role in the introduction of mandatory gender quotas in general elections in the Republic of Ireland. These helped lead to a doubling of the proportion of female *candidates* and a 48% rise in the proportion of women *elected representatives* in the 2016 Irish general election, and there were further increases at the 2020 general election. A rise in women’s representation in the 2019 Irish local government election can also be attributed, in part, to the indirect impact of mandatory quotas. In addition, Galligan’s research had a significant beneficial impact on the policies and practice of one major political party, Fianna Fáil, through the work of a commission on women’s representation chaired by Galligan. Finally, Galligan’s research also led to the establishment of a women’s caucus at the Northern Ireland Assembly and, indirectly, to the setting up of a similar body in the Irish parliament. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Professor Galligan has published widely on the democratic problem of women's under\-representation in Ireland. In research articles, public presentations and commissioned reports for political parties, she has developed a case for the use of gender quotas in political and public settings as a means of addressing the persistent gender deficit in public decision\-making in the country. 

 In the early 2000s, Galligan \(with Kathleen Knight of Columbia University and Una Nic Giolla Choille of Trinity College, Dublin\) played a leading role in a research study on women’s underrepresentation in Irish politics. The research examined elected women representatives' experience of political life and the attitudes of women political elites in Ireland toward positive action initiatives that would assist in increasing women's legislative presence. This study, which was based on a survey of the views of both current and retired female elected representatives, was the first systematic research in Ireland conducted on female politicians' views on the measures needed to support women's political ambitions and careers. The survey found majority support among Irish female elected representatives \(current and retired\) for a legal requirement that Irish political parties should field a minimum percentage of women candidates \[1\]. 

 In \[2\], Galligan provided a comprehensive review of what she referred to as the “glacial” pace of progress in addressing the under\-representation of women in Irish politics. This review, published in 2009, presented a wealth of data on women’s under\-representation. Galligan concluded that political parties would need to take “strong affirmative action” measures in order to make any significant progress on the issue. 

 In \[3\], published in 2006, Galligan reviewed the relative effectiveness of the implementation of a range of gender quota options – both mandatory and voluntary. She concluded that, while voluntary quotas might appear to be more effective in some respects, they were vulnerable to the risk of abandonment. 

 She also highlighted the importance of female politicians joining forces, together with civil society representatives, to press for gender parity: 

 Coalition building to press for political parity has yielded particularly positive results ― sensitising society to gender equality, creating a climate accepting of gender equality norms, and providing political women with an important source of leverage in pursuit of parity claims.  The most effective and enduring strategies stem from a coalition of female politicians, women leaders and feminist activists \[3\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Galligan’s research can be seen in a number of critical developments which have taken place since August 2013. Firstly, in the considerable and very significant impact of legislation on gender quotas which her work helped to shape. This was most evident in the 2016 Irish general election but the legislation’s beneficial impact could also be seen in the 2020 Irish general election. Secondly, in the impact of a commission chaired by Galligan on the policies and practice of a major political party. Thirdly, in the indirect impact of the legislation on government policy and representation of women in the Irish 2019 local government election and, finally, in the impact of Galligan’s research on the establishment of women’s caucuses in the Oireachtas \(Irish Houses of Parliament\) and in the Northern Ireland Assembly. 

 **Impact of gender quota legislation: 2016 general election** 

 In 2012, the Electoral \(Amendment\) \(Political Funding\) Act was passed by the Oireachtas. This Act provided for a gender quota of 30%, rising to 40% at a later date, a measure which was directly influenced by Galligan’s research \[1\] and \[3\] \[A\]. A major aspect of the impact of her research from August 2013 onwards, reported here, derives from the impact of the relevant section of that Act. 

 For this reason, it is necessary to briefly trace how that link arises, even though the Act itself was passed during the previous REF impact period. On 9<sup>th</sup> September 2009, Galligan gave evidence to a joint Oireachtas committee which was investigating the issue of women’s participation in politics \[A\]. In its report, the committee drew extensively on Galligan’s oral submission, and on her published work \[A\]. Most notably, Galligan’s submission and research helped shape the sub\-committee’s recommendation that provisions should be made for a 33.3% female candidate quota, potentially rising thereafter. This recommendation, slightly adapted, was adopted in Section 42 of the Act \[A\]. 

 The first opportunity to put this legislation into practice arose with the 2016 General Election in Ireland. The legislation had considerable impact. There was a marked increase in both the proportion of candidates selected who were women and in the proportion of representatives who were actually elected. Overall, there was a doubling \(100% increase\) in the proportion of candidates who were women compared to the most recent 2011 General Election; 30% of the candidates who contested the election were women, compared to just 15% in 2011. The 2016 proportion was the highest ever percentage of female candidates for a general election in Ireland \[B\]. 

 Moreover, the impact of these changes in the gender of the candidates helped to bring about a significant change in the gender mix of the Dáil \(lower house and principal chamber of the Oireachtas\). There was a 48% increase in the proportion of women elected compared to 2011, meaning 22% of TDs \(Irish members of parliament\) elected were women, the highest proportion of women deputies in the history of the Irish state. Indeed, analysing these results, Buckley et al. conclude: 

 Without doubt, gender quotas contributed to an increase in women’s candidate selection and election in the 2016 general election. They helped create a cultural shift in political parties whereby women party members and their electoral ambitions were no longer overlooked \[B\]. 

 A leading Irish women’s organisation, the National Women’s Council of Ireland \(NWCI\) also publicly attributed the transformation to the introduction of gender quotas. Louise Glennon of the NWCI commented: 

 Gender quotas were necessary to accelerate the pace of change for women’s equality, and it is clear that they were successful. Progress wasn’t happening without quotas… \[C\] 

 **Impact of Markievicz Commission on party policy and practice** 

 Of the larger parties, Fianna Fáil oversaw the most spectacular transformation. No female Fianna Fáil candidates had been elected in 2011. However, in 2016, the party increased its proportion of women candidates by 111% and was successful in returning six female TDs. In order to help achieve this change, the party implemented a number of recommendations which were made by a special commission, the Markievicz Commission. 

 The Commission, which was chaired by Galligan and drew on Galligan’s research and expertise, was tasked with examining how the party could ensure greater female participation in politics. The Commission’s report was launched by the party’s leader, Micheál Martin TD, in January 2015.  He acknowledged the challenge which the report presented for the party: 

 … I am delighted with the work Professor Galligan and her colleagues on the Commission have carried out. It represents a constructive challenge to the entire party organisation which I am determined we will meet \[D\]. 

 The Commission’s report recommended a series of measures, including two which related specifically to the forthcoming 2016 general election campaign: 

1.  the party’s National Constituencies Committee should direct constituencies to select a woman where necessary 

1.  the party should ensure that it met the 30% minimum quota of female candidates \[E\] 

 These recommendations were fully implemented; party headquarters issued directives to its members in five constituencies, and 31% of the candidates selected overall were women \[F\]. In total, Fianna Fáil implemented 14 of the report’s 16 recommendations in full or in part; seven recommendations were implemented in full and seven further recommendations were implemented in part \[F\]. In addition, the Commission’s report was discussed at the party’s Ard Fheis \(annual conference\) and at all party branch meetings. The then President of the Fianna Fáil Women’s Network has described the report as being “very significant” in enabling the party to adopt a major change in policy and practice \[G\]. 

 **Impact in 2019 local government election and 2020 general election: women’s representation and government policy** 

 The success of the quota measure in the 2016 general election led to a call by the NWCI for the government to introduce a similar mandatory quota for the local government election in 2019 \[C\]. Although this did not happen, in 2019, the Irish government introduced a funding scheme to incentivise political parties to field more women candidates in the 2019 local government election, including a specific measure to incentivise parties to field at least 30% female candidates. While not a legal requirement, this was in line with the 2012 legislation and, according to the government, the use of the 30% threshold was influenced by that legislation \[H\]. 

 In that election, the proportion of female candidates rose significantly from 22% in the previous local government election in 2014 to 28% in 2019, while women as a proportion of elected candidates also rose, from 21% in 2014 to 24% \[I\]. 

 The following year, there was another general election which was held on 8<sup>th</sup> February, 2020. In that election, all the major parties met or exceeded the mandatory 30% quota, helping to ensure that the highest ever number of female candidates was fielded \[C\]. There was also a further slight increase in the proportion of women elected, to 23% \(from 22% in 2016\) \[J\]. 

 **Impact in Dáil and Northern Ireland Assembly: women’s caucuses** 

 Galligan’s work has also had a significant impact on the work of the Northern Ireland Assembly, although this was curtailed by the dissolution of the Assembly in January 2017. In March 2016, the Assembly launched a cross\-party Assembly Women’s Caucus \[K\]. The establishment of a Caucus was due, at least in part, to a submission from Galligan to a high\-level Assembly committee which, drawing on her work in \[3\] and elsewhere, advocated the establishment of an Assembly Women’s Caucus. The Committee’s report endorsed this and other recommendations from Galligan, and this led to the setting up of the Caucus \[L\]. According to the then Chair of the Caucus, Galligan “played a key role in advising us on how to move forward” \[L\]. Moreover, the Caucus Chair subsequently recommended to the Speaker of the Dáil that the Oireachtas should establish a Women’s Caucus and the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus was established in 2017 \[K\] \[L\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Kate Marsh’s historical research into French metropolitan representations of colonialism and the relationships between competing European imperial powers in the eighteenth century has directly influenced artistic practice. A four\-year long collaboration with the Singh Twins, inspired by her 2009 monograph, has resulted in the creation of a substantial new body of work \[text removed for publication\]. This included an initial set of eleven ‘digital lightbox artworks’ and nine ‘hand\-painted works’ created for the jointly\-conceived exhibition Slaves of Fashion. Linking colonial trade and Atlantic slavery with current global practices, the exhibition has improved public understanding of and community engagement with the legacy of imperialism in Britain, prompting self\-reflection and the capacity for behavioural change, particularly in relation to consumer choices. Beneficiaries include: artists, museum curators, and the wider public. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The underpinning research was conducted by Marsh, who joined the University of Liverpool as a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow in 2005 and was appointed Professor of French Historical Studies in 2014. Funded initially by her  Leverhulme ECF, ‘Representations of India in French Texts 1754–1815’, and subsequently by an AHRC project grant, ‘Peripheral Voices and European Colonialism: Representations of India in French Literature and Culture 1750–1962’,  on which Marsh was CI, the early research was motivated by the lacuna in the existing historiography, both Anglophone and Francophone, regarding the French presence on the Indian subcontinent until 1954, seven years after the end of the British Raj. 

 Through extensive archival research in Paris and London on the French Compagnie des Indes, and by tracing published works on India across genres, the project revealed an intellectual and textual exchange between India and France, frequently via Britain, in the eighteenth century.<sup>3.</sup><sup>1</sup> It highlighted not only an imperial rivalry played out, literally and textually, in India between the traditional frères ennemis, but also active collusions that were temporally and geographically contingent. India in the French Imagination<sup>3.</sup><sup>2</sup>, exploring French representations of India between the recall of Dupleix in 1754, which effectively curtailed French ambitions in India, and the Treaty of Paris in 1815, which reduced the French Indian empire to a rump of five comptoirs or trading posts, examines the British conquest of India as seen through French eyes, emphasizing global connections as a constitutive element of local and national histories. The focus of the work on the declining fortunes of the French Compagnie des Indes in the eighteenth century also reached innovative conclusions concerning periodizations and geographical categorizations of French ‘colonial’ projects, stressing the links between the slave plantations of the Caribbean and trade with the East. From the outset, the French East India trade was only intermittently as successful as that of France’s competitors, the English and the Dutch, and tended to run at a deficit which was regulated by the exportation of precious metals to India. This exportation linked East Indian trade with the West Indies and the slave plantations on Saint\-Domingue, as piastres were imported to France from the trade in enslaved Africans in the West Indies and then exported to India and exchanged for cotton, calicoes and painted indiennes — highly prized luxuries from the East. The transatlantic slave trade is generally accepted as following a triangular route, but this simple and useful geometric analogy elides the interdependence of trade and the ways in which trading in luxuries, muslins and indiennes linked France and Europe with India and the plantations in the Caribbean. Subsequent research has interrogated the influence of Indian ideas on French literature and French fashions in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries<sup>3.4</sup><sup>,</sup> <sup>3.5</sup>, the experiences of indentured Indians who travelled from the British Raj to the French sugar\-growing colony of Martinique<sup>3.3</sup> and, more recently, how British Indians exploited imperial rivalry to advance the Indian Nationalist agenda.<sup>3.6</sup> 

 In 2014, Marsh was approached by internationally renowned artists The Singh Twins after they read her 2009 monograph<sup>3.6</sup>. The Twins were planning a series of artworks that would explore the story of Indian textiles and its relationship with transnational cultures, politics and economics, with a focus on the Indo\-British relationship, and were interested in the wider connections between Indian and European trade outside the well\-known story of the British Raj. Following a discussion of the key findings of Marsh’s research — specifically, the neglected story of French control of the Deccan region of India in the early eighteenth century, and the role which trade with India played in financing the sugar plantations in Saint\-Domingue — Marsh and the Twins co\-devised the Slaves of Fashion project aimed at exploring neglected global histories and the legacies of imperialism and the slave trade.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Marsh’s research on comparative imperial histories has inspired artistic practices and supported curatorial interpretation of the global histories of objects; in turn, this has influenced public understandings of how cross\-cultural encounters in the past have shaped place and society in the twenty\-first century. 

 4.1 Inspiring Artistic Practices and the Creation of New Art Works 

 Marsh’s research inspired new forms of artistic expression through the creation of a substantial new body of work by The Singh Twins \[text removed for publication\] *.*<sup>5.2</sup> The Twins are distinguished for their artworks that deal with socio\-political issues surrounding heritage and identity, and they continue to have work exhibited in public and private collections around the world. Amongst many other prestige appointments, the Singh Twins, were awarded an MBE by the Queen in 2011 for services to art, and appointed official Artists in Residence at the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002. They have had numerous exhibitions across the UK and internationally, including at major galleries in Mumbai, New Delhi, Toronto, California, and Texas. The co\-designed Slaves of Fashion project resulted in the Singh Twins’ ongoing creation of a new body of work, as well as the joint delivery of a major new exhibition and associated events for public audiences 

 Marsh’s research was key support to the successful completion of an initial set of twenty new artworks with historical themes. As The Twins stated, ‘Kate provided historical insight, references and sources from her own research, stimulating our thinking … inform\[ing\] our creative practice and directly shap\[ing\] and influenc\[ing it\]’.<sup> *5.1*</sup> For example, in the artwork Coromandel: Sugar and Spice, not so nice,  key elements such as the Dutch costume and the inclusion of images of Coromandel birds and a tree bearing fruit are inspired and drawn from the collaboration and Marsh’s research. Symbolism and Interconnectedness informed by the research are even more explicit in Indiennes: The Extended Triangle, with the ambivalence of the piece underlining how far wealth in mainland Europe stemmed from trade overseas, and evoking the ending of slavery on Saint\-Domingue. These artworks are currently part of The Twins’ private touring collection \[text removed for publication\] *.* In addition to this, the artists have created a series of ten large scale tapestry interpretations of the original artworks, also informed by Marsh’s research, that have already generated international interest \[text removed for publication\] *.<sup>5.*</sup><sup>1</sup> 

 Following the Slaves of Fashion exhibition, Marsh’s inspiration generated longer\-term benefits for the artists. The exhibition at the Walker led to a new commission for the Twins from the Royal Collection Trust, which was displayed as part of the Splendours of the Subcontinent exhibition at Buckingham Palace, and the Twins’ work Rule Britannia: Legacies of Exchange <ins> </ins>now has a lasting presence on the Royal Collection Trust website.<sup> *5.3*</sup>  Additionally, the exhibition led to a collaboration with Manchester Museum in 2019, and a new triptych \(now part of the original series\) that commemorates the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919.<sup> *5.</sup><sup>1</sup>* \[text removed for publication\].<sup>5.2</sup> 

 4.2 Informing Exhibition Practices and Curatorial Understanding 

 The resulting exhibition of The Twins’ work, entitled Slaves of Fashion, was staged at the Walker Art Gallery \(National Museums Liverpool\) and Wolverhampton Art Gallery \(WAG\). It presented twenty new artworks by the twins, displays of objects from the collections of National Museums Liverpool \(NML\), and a series of video installations in which Marsh provided unprecedented insights. The latter revealed how everyday historical objects contain hidden histories of imperial conquest and exploitation. The exhibition attracted thousands of visitors to the galleries, 105,520 at NML and 39,400 at Wolverhampton, more than doubling the target audience.<sup> *5.4*</sup> In evaluating this achievement, the project curator at NML explained, ‘there is no doubt that the academic rigour of the research underpinning the exhibition, provided by Kate Marsh, was an important aspect of its success’.  The extensive scholarly work of Marsh provided curators with the confidence to explore new curatorial strategies as well as enabling institutional engagement for the first\-time with ways in which items in the museum’s collections are linked to Britain’s colonial past, histories of conflict, enslavement and empire. The NML curator noted that Kate’s involvement ‘enabled us to build on our commitment to confronting challenging issues in our exhibitions and displays’ explaining that this was ‘the first time that we had put on an exhibition of this scale, focusing on these topics’. In light of seeing the exhibition at Wolverhampton, the curators of the Norwich Museum and Art Gallery have now scheduled an exhibition of Slaves of Fashion for 2022.<sup> *5.</sup><sup>1*</sup> 

 Moreover, Marsh’s work with NML and WAG in the context of the exhibitions offered a fresh model for interpreting historical objects alongside new artworks to tell histories of cross\-cultural transfer and translation, which have influenced future curatorial work. Indeed, the NML curator explained that ‘\[Marsh\] heightened my own awareness of how objects in our collection are linked to Britain’s colonial past in ways that are not always immediately obvious’.<sup> *5.4*</sup> The curatorial approach modelled by Marsh also received much attention in reviews of Slaves of Fashion and was particularly highlighted by visitors as an enjoyable element of the exhibition which challenged them to think differently.<sup>5.4</sup>  The Heritage Lab highlighted that ‘a touch screen featuring academic responses by Prof Kate Marsh \[…\] reveals the fascinating hidden histories behind selected objects’.<sup> *5.7*</sup> Visitors to the Wolverhampton gallery praised the research\-informed videos in which Marsh explains the significance of the artworks, with one visitor stating that the histories embedded within these interactive features, not only ‘provided a narrative to the exhibition but allowed the wider viewing audience to better understand the journey of the artefacts and craftsmanship depicted. Making the whole exhibition an educationally enriched experience of better understanding history and heritage’.<sup> *5.9*</sup> Marsh’s collaboration with The Singh Twins and gallery professionals resulted in enhancements to the interpretation of the exhibition, and in turn, this contributed to the quality of the visitor experience. 

 4.3 Influencing Public Understanding of Cross\-Cultural Encounters and Consumerism 

 At the Walker Art Gallery, the exhibition’s examination of how far Indian culture has shaped ‘British’ identity stimulated capacity for self\-reflection and understanding of prejudice in twenty\-first\-century society: one visitor remarked that it provided a ‘different perspective on the British Empire to that which I am accustomed’ and another said that it provided ‘many historical details not taught’ in schools.<sup> *5.5.*</sup> Marsh’s research\-led engagement with diverse audiences through the exhibition and a corresponding workshop at the Wolverhampton Art Gallery \(WAG\) increased interest in and understanding of the heritage themes and issues at the centre of The Twins’ artwork. This generated changes in individual perspectives and enabled community engagement with the legacies of cross\-cultural encounters, consumerism, and imperialism. Visitor feedback to the exhibition and workshop revealed that explicit parallels drawn between slavery and current global practices had encouraged people to reflect on historical and contemporary cross\-cultural encounters, and also inspired changes to consumer habits. 

 The workshop at WAG led by Marsh in August 2018 was attended by 100 delegates and resulted in changes to participants’ perception of global problems. The event changed the way participants thought about their own buying habits.  Attendees stated that they were now aware of ‘ethical manufacturers/suppliers/organisations’, and also acknowledged that in making their own clothes, they would be ‘much more aware about buying my fabric’ and ‘will now think and ask more about \[…\] “who made my fabric”’.<sup> *5.8*</sup> The symposium evoked reflection on environmental impact\(s\) of consumerism and buying choices, for instance, one participant was ‘concerned by the impact of palm oil plantations on the environment’, and was encouraged to ‘look at what I buy more carefully’.<sup> *5.8*</sup> Moreover, others claimed that the event had encouraged them to ‘shop/buy more sustainably’, and that it had reinforced their ‘commitment to making a difference through \[…\] daily choices’. <sup> *</sup><sup>5.8*</sup> This research\-led event enabled new ways of thinking amongst this audience, leading them to consider how their habits were \(and continued to be\) part of a global network of cross\-cultural encounters. The Slaves of Fashion exhibition also received much media interest, engaging broader audiences with the interrelated themes of Empire, colonialism, conflict, slavery and luxury lifestyle, with Slaves of Fashion profiled on BBC Television's 'North West Tonight', ‘Inside Out’ and ‘The One Show’, and one of the regional documentaries commissioned for the BBC’s ‘Civilisations’ series.<sup> *5.3*</sup> 

 4.4 Inspiring Diverse Community Engagement with the Legacies of Imperialism 

 Marsh’s role in foregrounding the topical issues at the heart of the Slaves of Fashion exhibition influenced secondary civic and community encounters with the artworks and subject matter. Her research\-led engagement enhanced cultural participation with the exhibition amongst marginalised and diverse audiences, with particular resonance for female audiences from a variety of backgrounds. As the NML anonymized visitor feedback to Slaves of Fashion shows, diverse and specific audiences found inspiration in the exhibition’s content, and its modern\-day relevance stimulated further engagement beyond their initial visit; for instance, a teacher who visited stated that they would ‘be showing this to my students as inspiration for all, but in particular our Asian women students’; whilst another visitor was inspired to ‘use ideas raised from this \[exhibition\] in the Processions Suffrage Project’.<sup> *5.5*</sup>  Take for example, the teacher who stated that a Year 9 art student had been so inspired by Slaves of Fashion that they decided to focus their EPQ project on ‘whether fashion could be sustainable and ethical’, using ideas on ‘slave labour, politics and consumerism’ from the exhibition in order to create a dress from recycled plastics.<sup> *5.10*</sup>  A teacher at the Khalsa Academy, Wolverhampton, attended the exhibition and workshop, and used the material Marsh provided ‘to organise educational visits to the exhibition for marginalised groups such as E.A.L. young people and retired elderly Asian women’.<sup> *5.9*</sup> They also found that ‘Kate’s research findings helped \[…\] deliver a real narrative to the exhibition, bring the visual art to life and giving each piece a meaning for the groups that visited the exhibition’.<sup> *5.9*</sup> In particular, they reported that ‘the group of retired elderly Asian women were especially moved by hearing the research/ story behind the symbolic artistic interpretations created by The Singh Twins and gave these women a link to their past heritage’.<sup> *5.9*</sup> 

 The collaboration on Slaves of Fashion continues to have a lasting impact on the artists themselves, their future plans, and audiences. The Twins have plans for a coffee table fine art book that will feature Marsh’s essay response to the series. Furthermore, the artists aim to find a permanent home for this work: ‘\[o\]ur vision is to have this as a dedicated gallery and educational resource which honours Kate's contribution and memory: a place to engage with and enjoy art but also to encourage debate and raise public awareness about hidden histories of Empire and Colonialism that have universal relevance to diverse communities and continue to impact on modern society. \[…\] We envision creating something \[…\] which delivers the aims that we originally shared with Kate to create a cultural offer that is accessible in it's presentation and interpretation: adopting an interdisciplinary approach \(combining artistic, curatorial and academic perspectives\) to exploring history and historical artifacts’.<sup> *5.</sup><sup>1*</sup>

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 After demonstrating that traditional approaches to reduce development impacts on newts often fail, Professor Griffiths’ team developed a new approach combining eDNA surveys for newts with ‘risk map’ modelling. The approach has been adopted by Defra/Natural England, leading to a new landscape\-level approach for mitigation that combines eDNA data and modelling – District Level Licensing. Additionally, both the eDNA and modelling protocols have been rapidly adopted by businesses, planning authorities, and commercial laboratories. This has resulted in conservation benefits for newts, while cutting the delays and costs that hindered traditional approaches. By March 2020, this scheme had been implemented in 69 planning authorities across England, with 386 ponds created or restored for newts. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In a speech on 30 June 2020, the Prime Minister declared that ‘Newt counting delays are a massive drag on the prosperity of this country’. The great crested newt has been declining across its European range and receives full legal protection in the UK. However, the widespread distribution of the species means that it frequently comes into conflict with infrastructure development. Traditional approaches to mitigate the impacts of such development are both expensive and often ineffective. Griffiths and his team at the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology \(DICE\) at Kent have created and validated new approaches to mitigating the impacts of commercial and residential development in the UK. These new approaches have significant implications for wider scientific and policy efforts, specifically with respect to protected species and habitats, and are capturing the interest of other countries experiencing similar issues **\[R1\]**. The underpinning research, which has been published from **2014** onwards, was undertaken in three stages: 

1.  **Demonstrating the shortcomings of traditional mitigation measures** 

 Although mitigation of development impacts on protected species and habitats is often required by law, the outcomes of mitigation actions are rarely rigorously assessed. Combining field surveys with systematic evidence review and analysis of unpublished post\-development reports, work by Griffiths’ team found no conclusive evidence that mitigation for great crested newts is effective. Where data were available, there was little evidence that the mitigation actions benefited the populations, with overall declines occurring at about 60% of sites \( **2014\-17**\). This was followed by further research in partnership with Amphibian and Reptile Conservation, commissioned by Defra and Natural England, analysing the impact of traditional actions to mitigate development impacts on great crested newts **\[R2\]**. 

1.  **A new eDNA method for assessing great crested newt populations** 

 Recent advances in DNA technology have enabled the detection of species through the DNA that has been shed into the environment, known as environmental or eDNA. In collaboration with partner organisations \(Freshwater Habitats Trust, Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust, SPYGEN, Natural England, and Defra\), Griffiths’ team have taken the lead in developing and validating the technique to assess the distribution of great crested newts \( **2014\-15**\). In **2014**, the team published a technical report describing the method for government agencies to use as a protocol **\[R3\]**. A subsequent paper for a more general scientific audience was published in **2015** **\[R4\]** which has received over 260 citations in the last four years. Further refinement of the techniques has been conducted at Kent **\[R5\]** and has led to several training workshops for Natural England staff and other research users \( **2017\-20**\). 

1.  **New models for predicting the distribution of great crested newts** 

 After showing that traditional development mitigation practice was often ineffective, Griffiths’ team utilised data gathered using the new eDNA survey protocols to develop models that produced ‘risk maps’ for land\-use planners to predict the occurrence and distribution of great crested newts \( **2016**\). The risk maps were used to identify important areas for great crested newts, and highlighted how the design and implementation of mitigation measures could be improved **\[R6\]**. Following training at DICE, this approach was subsequently adopted by Natural England and Defra.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The new methodologies devised by Griffiths and the team at DICE have revolutionised the way in which great crested newt sites are assessed, and shifted mitigation measures away from inefficient site\-based protocols to a landscape\-level approach. Their work has led directly to changes in government policy at national level \(Defra, Natural England\), and acted as a catalyst for innovation and new business creation. The replacement of the previous piecemeal, fragmented approach to mitigation with strategic, district\-level schemes has benefited local authorities and developers throughout England. The impact on diversity has been significant, with high\-quality, better\-protected habitats for great crested newts than under the previous system, and improvements to the methods of surveillance of protected species by conservation bodies. The research on great crested newts also has wider implications, not only for other protected species, but also for other countries balancing conservation with infrastructure development **\[R1\]**. Moreover, the DICE team are informing the rollout and future adoption of these new approaches through training and knowledge\-sharing, and via appointments to the committee advising Natural England on licensing and implementation. 

 **Adoption of eDNA methodology by statutory agencies and across national programmes** 

 Whereas developers were traditionally required to undertake surveys using onerous and seasonally restrictive protocols to ascertain the presence of great crested newts, the eDNA methodology developed by Griffiths et al. **\[R3, R4\]** is a rapid occupancy assessment tool that requires a single visit to a site. Since **2014**, the technique outlined in the report **\[R3\]** has been adopted by Natural England as a licensable protocol in England and Wales, and has fundamentally changed the way in which newt surveys are carried out **\[a, b\]**. The technology has led to at least nine commercial laboratories setting up to provide a great crested newt eDNA analysis service **\[c\]**. Nature Metrics – a technology start\-up using cutting\-edge genetic techniques to monitor biodiversity – is one such laboratory that has been working with the partnership since **2018** to develop new biodiversity footprint and impact assessment tools based primarily on freshwater communities. As the Co\-founder and Technical Director of Nature Metrics highlights: ‘The DICE team at the University of Kent, led by Prof. Griffiths, have been pivotal in developing and applying survey protocols that combine emerging DNA technologies with spatial and statistical modelling. In turn, since 2018 this has driven new approaches to assessing development impacts’ **\[c\]**. NatureSpace, a partner of Nature Metrics, has been ‘utilising these new protocols within their new district level licensing scheme that has been expanding over England these last three years’ **\[c\]**. 

 In addition to revolutionising approaches to identifying great crested newts at individual sites, the further refinement of the eDNA method by Griffiths’ team – which involves combining large\-scale eDNA surveys with species distribution modelling – has enabled distribution assessments on a scale that would have been prohibitive using previous protocols \( **2016\-20**; **\[R6\]**\). This methodology has been adopted for national species surveillance programmes by the Freshwater Habitats Trust, whose PondNET scheme is the largest\-ever eDNA\-based citizen science survey of freshwater habitats. The Director of the Trust explains: ‘It has been quite extraordinary how quickly the eDNA method has been developed and applied for broader freshwater sampling \[…\]. The data emerging from PondNet indicate freshwater biodiversity at a scale and cost that could not have been considered possible just a few years ago. We are therefore continuing to work closely with the University of Kent team so that we can continue to capitalize on new developments in this area as they emerge’ **\[d\]**. The Trust are also applying the eDNA method to other aquatic animals – for example, to identify sites with alien American Bullfrogs. 

 **Implementing District Level Licensing in local authorities and major infrastructure projects** 

 The work by Griffiths et al. is used as the basis of District Level Licencing schemes, which use ‘risk maps’ for great crested newts based on the team’s methodology of combining large\-scale eDNA surveys with species distribution modelling. Following their development of the initial risk maps, the DICE team trained Natural England and NatureSpace staff to apply the protocol within their own schemes. Instead of commissioning inefficient surveys and paying for mitigation methods that often fail, developers pay into a district\-level compensation scheme that funds large\-scale habitat creation in advance of any development. This approach was adopted as Government policy in England in **2016**, with detailed guidance for developers now provided by Natural England/Defra **\[e\]**. It is already being implemented across 80 planning authorities in England **\[g\]**. 

 In **2018**, the NatureSpace Partnership started implementing the District Level Licensing scheme in the South Midlands under licence from Natural England **\[f, h\]**. Since then, the Partnership has been granted further licences to deliver the scheme across 21 Local Planning Authorities spanning the breadth of England, and is awaiting licensing for a further 40 LPAs **\[f\]**. The work of the Partnership is highlighted as a case study in the UK Government’s 25\-Year Environment Plan \(p. 142\). The Chief Executive of NatureSpace explained: ‘The District Licensing scheme for great crested newts emerged from the long\-term frustration of all parties \(including Government\) at the cost and ineffectiveness of traditional methods to mitigate the impact of development on newts. Professor Griffiths and his team were instrumental in gathering and publishing the scientific evidence that has driven the need for change’ **\[f\]**. He adds: ‘The University of Kent team were involved with the development and testing of the original eDNA survey protocol and spatial modelling on which the risk maps are based. They have been instrumental in ensuring that the scheme is strongly evidence\-based and continue to work with us to undertake valuable applied R&D to improve the protocols further. With continued University of Kent assistance, we have recently developed further risk maps for the UK’s major rail infrastructure provider, who are now adopting this novel approach to mitigating engineering impacts within their own planning’ **\[f\]**. 

 DLL is reducing risk, uncertainty, delays, and costs within the construction and planning sectors, and developers has responded positively to the new approach **\[f, j\]**. For example, Duncan Chadwick, Partner, David Lock Associates, said: ‘Using the NatureSpace district licensing scheme helped speed up the planning process for us. If we’d have gone down the traditional route, we would have had to wait at least another two months before we could even survey the site for great crested newts.

 **Impact on conservation of District Level Licensing** 

 As part of the NatureSpace initiative the Newt Conservation Partnership was formed as a not\-for\-profit community\-interest organisation to carry out habitat creation and monitoring. It was initially formed as the South Midlands Newt Conservation Partnership, but ‘South Midlands’ was dropped as it rapidly expanded nationally. Griffiths is a Director and Buxton a project officer of the Newt Conservation Partnership. Its purpose is to create and manage high\-quality habitat for great crested newts and other species, using funds from developers. Locations of compensation sites are also informed by the risk maps, and require a clean water source, a high chance of population viability, and a location within range of an existing newt population to maximise the chance of natural colonisation. This will result in better conservation outcomes, as newt populations can remain healthy and expand across the countryside, rather than trying to retain populations with poor long\-term viability in urbanised, heavily managed environments. As the Chief Executive of NatureSpace states: ‘the work of the DICE team is clearly contributing to better conservation outcomes for this species’ **\[f\]**. 

 To date, District Level Licensing has resulted in the creation or restoration of 386 such ponds to compensate for potential development impacts **\[k\]**. This has benefited nature conservation and provided net gain for the species within the landscape. 

 **Impact on future policy development** 

 The DICE team are helping to shape long\-term policy development through the appointment of Griffiths and Buxton to Natural England’s Great Crested Newt Expert Licensing Panel in **2018**. This is an advisory committee to help implement new great crested newt licensing policies and thereby contribute to delivering the Government’s 25\-Year Environment Plan \(2017\) and Natural England’s Conservation Strategy ‘Conservation 21’ \(2016\) **\[a\]**. These appointments are influencing both the technical and the strategic direction of District Level Licensing. 

 The Director of Specialist Services and Programmes at Natural England stated: ‘Both Professor Griffiths and Dr Buxton from DICE have been appointed to this panel on the strength of their research in this area. The panel has been instrumental in helping to develop GCN \[great crested newt\] conservation partnerships, and informing, refining and reviewing monitoring strategies to ensure that our new licensing policies deliver better conservation outcomes for GCN at a landscape scale **.** This represents a significant step\-change in the way Natural England now mitigates the impact of development activities on biodiversity’ **\[e\]**. 

 **Training in e\-DNA methods and data analysis** 

 To consolidate the impact, the research team has engaged strongly with professionals, volunteers, and statutory agencies. As the research was emerging, Griffiths was asked by Natural England to serve as an expert on a ‘Science and the Law’ panel in **2016**. Workshops relating to the use of environmental DNA for professional surveys were subsequently run at the Herpetofauna Workers’ Meeting – a national conference for professionals and volunteers – in **2017**, **2019**, and **2020** to present the research; analyse the perceived advantages and disadvantages of the eDNA method; and answer questions from research users. An additional workshop was run in **February 2017** for Natural England licensing advisers on the interpretation of environmental DNA results, so they are now providing informed advice to licence applicants **\[i\]**. This has resulted in over 300 practitioners who are now better\-equipped to deliver and interpret the results of eDNA\-based surveys.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Durham University’s Conservation Ecology Group \(CEG\) identify the potential impacts of climate change on biodiversity using ecological models. A wide range of stakeholders, including Conservation NGOs, national government bodies and international organisations have applied the outputs from these models to: \(1\) change conservation management plans for single sites and across national and international networks; \(2\) change national and international policy on biodiversity and \(3\) produce regional and global assessment outputs of the impact of climate change on natural systems. Durham’s research has directed governmental and non\-governmental policy at national and regional scales, stimulating climate change adaptation for biodiversity across the planet. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research undertaken at Durham University by Willis, Huntley and Stephens has been at the forefront of applied conservation research. The work of Durham’s CEG has been fundamental in identifying the potential impacts of future climate change on species and both Willis and Huntley are members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) Climate Change Specialist Group. The CEG has convincingly demonstrated the link between climate and contemporary population and range changes for diverse taxa \(R1, R2, R3\). Further work has developed novel approaches to guide changes to protected areas and protected area networks such that many species can persist in the face of future climate change \(R4, R5, R6\). The group have published >80 scientific papers on recent and future climate change impacts, which have been cited 19,940 times. Our recent research has shown that: 

-  **There is a systematic signal of recent climate change having affected populations of both widespread and protected bird species** across Europe and USA \(R1, R2\). Work in 2016 demonstrated, for the first time, that there is a consistent signal of climate change on population trends of all of the common terrestrial bird species across Europe and the USA \(R1, already cited 165 times\). We have also shown that: \(1\) species protected as *Annex 1* species in Europe, under the *EU Birds Directive*, for which EU member states are obliged to implement special conservation measures, have had more positive population trends than non\-Annex 1 species in recent decades \(R2\); \(2\) trends in population changes of common bird species are occurring in directions consistent with projections related to future human\-induced climate change \(R3, cited 309 times\). 

-  Tropical vertebrate species are equally likely to be as highly impacted by climate change as species from higher latitudes, and **projected shifts in tropical species ranges will have profound impacts on their future conservation within protected area networks** \(R4, R5, R6\). This work has highlighted that, despite protected areas globally having been designated with no consideration of ongoing climate change, in many situations the established reserve networks will continue to provide climatically\-suitable habitats for species under future climate change \(R4, R5\). These findings have markedly affected conservation strategies globally. R5, and together with an accompanying companion paper \(Hole et al. 2009. *Ecology Letters* 12, 420\-431\), have been cited 390 times. 

-  **Simulations can guide conservation actions at individual protected areas** and across networks of sites, including changes to network and site configurations \(R5, R6\). This work \(R6\) was the first to apply regional climate models to project climate impacts on vertebrate species at a finer\-scale, and thus produce more realistic simulations. It was one of the first papers to demonstrate the very different potential impacts of climate change across different taxonomic groups, once their dispersal capabilities were considered. 

 The species distribution and abundance models developed at Durham are powerful tools for informing conservation policy on adaptation and mitigation, related to the impacts of climate change on species. These models have identified species that are vulnerable to climate change and which therefore need to be assisted in colonising new areas. Further, they have demonstrated the potential for high turnover of species across global protected area networks, and that such simulations can be used to guide future management at sites.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

###  Durham University \(DU\) research on climatic change and wildlife has had a global impact on conservation policy and environmental management related to biodiversity conservation. They have worked with many non\-academic stakeholders, shaping local, national and international policy and governance. The research has been applied at levels from individual sites to supranational conservation networks has informed decision making in >12 governments and >20 non\-government organisations. Examples of such work include: 

####  Impacts on conservation NGO policy 

1.  \[E1,2\] We have collaborated extensively with BirdLife International, a global conservation body that represents >200 national conservation charities, to estimate the threat of ongoing climatic change to BirdLife’s global *Important Birds and Biodiversity Network \(* [*https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/programme\-additional\-info/important\-bird\-and\-biodiversity\-areas\-ibas*](https://www.birdlife.org/worldwide/programme-additional-info/important-bird-and-biodiversity-areas-ibas) *\).* Our research has underpinned the climate adaptation strategy for this global conservation consortium, leading to the development of climate adaptation strategies for conservation globally. For example, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \(RSPB\), the UK BirdLife partner, has used our work for two decades to guide strategies for species introductions and climate\-conscious management priorities across its 200\+ UK nature reserves. An example is RSPB’s strategy on reintroduction sites for the rare Cirl Bunting in the UK, which was guided by suitability simulations from CEG.  BirdLife’s ‘ *BirdLife’s Position on Climate Change’* document \(2008 & subsequently 2015\) \[E1\] is the basis upon which the organisation advises its 200\+ partner organisations working on the ground. Along with grey literature reports and books, the document uses Durham’s *‘Climatic Atlas of European birds’* and three peer\-reviewed papers, two of which were produced by Durham, as the scientific rationale guiding their position. This document has led partner organisations to adapt management plans for individual sites in sub\-Saharan Africa \(e.g. Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi site examples described in E2\). 

1.  \[E2,E3\] We have worked with The National Audubon Society, the USA’s largest conservation NGO, to develop a climate action plan for the whole of the Americas \( [https://www.audubon.org/conservation/climate/actionplan](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/climate/actionplan); see page 7 of E3 acknowledging Durham’s modelling role\), which is now used as the underpinning framework for all their actions and advocacy work on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity across the region. This action plan is driven entirely by the projections of climate\-induced range shifts of birds across the Americas \(North, Central and South America\) undertaken at Durham. 

####  Impact on European Union policy 

 Durham research was instrumental in the retention of the EU Birds Directive, following a 2015 EU review \(E2, E4\), and thus, the conservation policies and strategies of the 28 member states. Research \(R2\), in which Durham climate modelling was key, was used by the RSPB and BirdLife International to demonstrate that the EU Directive was working effectively. A synthesis of the findings was distributed by the EU science policy department as an ‘EC Science for Environmental Policy’ note – 30<sup>th</sup> Sept 2016, to >20,000 governmental policy staff across the EU. The EU commissioned report ‘ *Evaluation study to support the Fitness Check of the Birds and Habitats Directives’* cites, as one of its ‘main sources of evidence’, Sanderson  *et al.* 2016 \(R2\). Thus, the research was critical in keeping this Directive in place, and hence continuing to protect key wildlife across Europe, at a time when ‘the future of the legislation \[was\] in doubt’ \(Mike Clark, RSPB Chief Executive; see foreword in  [http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/images/defendingnature\_tcm9\-406638.pdf](http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/images/defendingnature_tcm9-406638.pdf)\). 

####  Impact on International Climate Change Policy 

1.  \[E5,E6\] *United Nations \(UN\) Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\) Aichi Biodiversity Targets.* 

 The Aichi Biodiversity Targets were established in 2010 to protect global biodiversity. ‘Target 10: Vulnerable Ecosystems’, updated in 2016, is directly supported by a primary indicator derived from Durham research \[R3\] “Climatic impacts on European and North American Birds” \[E6\].  The indicators are used globally to monitor the progress of member states against the targets from the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\-2020. Thus, the indicators are used by the 196 member states, plus the EU, to guide their conservation actions. 

1.  \[E7\] *UN Climate Change Conference \(COP21\) meeting in Paris, Dec 2015.* 

 In 2015, The National Audubon Society and Birdlife International published a report ‘ *Messengers: what birds tell us about threats from climate change and solutions for nature and people’* which cites nine Durham publications \(including R3, 4, 5\) and uses case studies based on this work to illustrate the predicted effect of climate change on bird population.  This report formed the major plank of the organisations’ lobbying at COP21 meeting, which resulted in a global agreement to reduce the impact of human\-made climate change on ecosystems and forms the basis of both organisations’ climate change adaptation policies. 

####  Impacts on Conservation Management 

1.  <ins>\[</ins>E8\] *UN Environment Programme \(UNEP\): Impact on transboundary protected area management across West Africa to cope with climate change.* 

 Durham\-led research, funded by UNEP, explored the impacts of climate change on biodiversity across West Africa, specifically focused on Chad, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone and Togo \(e.g. R6\). The findings were used to identify gaps and future threats to the important West African protected area network in this region. The outputs of the modelling illustrate the vulnerability of all bird, mammal, amphibian and reptile species in the region and summaries of these vulnerabilities have been added to the world database on protected areas \(e.g. Figure 1\), made available by the IUCN World Conservation Monitoring Centre \(WCMC\). The modelling has since been used to inform conservation activities across the region \(see e.g. subsection 2 below\). The changes simulated by Durham models also formed the basis of future\-proof site conservation prioritisation strategies for the entire network \( [http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/recommendations\-and\-planning/identification\-of\-priority\-areas\-for\-biodiversity\-conservation](http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/recommendations-and-planning/identification-of-priority-areas-for-biodiversity-conservation)\). 



 Figure 1: An example of summary statistics for a West African protected area based on Durham modelling work. This particular protected area, in Sierra Leone, has now signed a transboundary agreement with adjoining Gola National Park in Liberia \(not shown\) as a result of our work \(see below\). 

1.  \[E8\] *On\-the\-ground activities to enhance climate change resilience of protected areas.* 

 As a result of the research described in \(1\), five West African pilot sites were selected \( [http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/regional\-and\-national\-activities/transboundary\-pilot\-site\-activities](http://parcc.protectedplanet.net/en/regional-and-national-activities/transboundary-pilot-site-activities)\) where protected areas in neighbouring countries abut each other. Figure 1 shows one such protected area in Sierra Leone, bordering Liberia. In these areas, transboundary protected areas will help species adapt to climate change, i.e. regions where adjacent protected areas in different countries will be more closely managed to facilitate species moving between protected areas in response to changing climate. In all, five transboundary agreements were signed \(most in 2016\) between countries and joint protected areas management plans integrating climate change were established. 

1.  \[E9\] Finally, work from Durham has been influential in the *IUCNs ‘Guidelines for Assessing Species Vulnerability to Climate Change* **’** including contributing 2 of 10 case studies \(pages 71\-73, pages 87\-89\). These guidelines are being used by protected area managers, and local, national and regional conservation managers and planners, to implement changes to management or to priority species on the basis of better\-informed species vulnerabilities to climate.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Ball has developed patented Artificial Neural Network based techniques to facilitate extraction of aetiological meaning from complex omics data repositories. NTU spin\-out Intelligent OMICS has licenced and commercialised Ball’s patented techniques, generating £230k revenues and attracting £2m finance. Intelligent OMICS has helped secure US Defence Threat Reduction Agency contracts with DSTL worth £4.5m to enable rapid diagnosis of infection, particularly trauma induced sepsis, impacting on healthcare in the military. Intelligent OMICS incorporation of AI methods into drug discovery process enabled Cumulus Oncology’s successful £1.7m fund raise. Low\-cost diagnostic panels have been shown to manage COPD by Mologic, benefitting clinical trial patients, and 56 latent TB cases identified during trials with Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital \(China\) enabled these patients to receive early treatment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 New approaches for studying disease systems at the genomic, epigenetic, proteomic and metabolomic levels are continually developed to predict responses to therapy or identify new drug targets. The challenges in analysing large molecular datasets lie in their volume, resolution and complexity, and the quality of the data, which can lead to false discovery and overfitting \(i.e. falsely elevated diagnostic performance\). 

 Research at NTU, led by Ball over 18 years, has developed a novel Machine Learning systems approach to *in silico* biomarker discovery. Based on Artificial Neural Networks \(ANNs\), Ball’s computational algorithms facilitate analysis of large complex omics datasets, to identify non\-linear biomarkers associated with clinical features concordant across multiple datasets. The algorithms study interactions between nodes within a single disease pathway and identify the most influential sets of biomarkers in a given biological system. 

 The initial concept was to utilise ANNs with a constrained architecture enabling them to discover robust biomarkers from complex omics data. Ball’s group was the one of the first to mine mass spectrometry data using an ANN approach; the first study identified biomarker ions that accurately differentiated between two common types of brain tumours, astrocytoma and glioblastoma \( **R1**\). These ANN algorithms were further developed to model public molecular data repositories like the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas \( **G1, G2, G3, G4**\) in order to identify robust molecular diagnostic panels from the whole transcriptome, concordant across multiple data sets. This approach provided a rank order of the molecular biomarkers associated with a given clinical question, overcame the issues of false discovery and overfitting, and improved the predictive performance for unseen cases from disease populations. In a collaborative study \( **G5, G6, G7, G8**\) \(Ball: Joint PI\) with Nottingham University Hospitals Trust \(NUH\), it was used to validate a gene expression profile for the detection of clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients, having reduced a 70\-gene signature to just nine genes capable of accurately predicting distant metastases \( **R2**\). Patents for the ANN data methods were filed in 2009, and a spinout company Intelligent OMICS was launched to exploit the algorithmic IP and the methods \(Note: Compandia Ltd was incorporated 12 Feb 2008, then renamed CompanDX Ltd, the company is now CompanDX PVT in China and Intelligent OMICS in the UK\). 

 Further work extended the rank order concept to undertake a meta\-analysis over multiple questions and multiple data sets \( **G1**\). Ball developed a new algorithm that utilised ANN\-based network inference \(ANNi\) methods \( **G1, G3**\) to model networks of molecular interactions between context\-specific biomarkers, for a given pathway or disease, based on whole transcriptomic data. By identifying associations between molecules in a pathway and the remaining molecules in the whole transcriptome, new pathway features for a given disease could be identified and analysed to find the most influential molecular drivers in a given system. 

 These new approaches were applied in a breakthrough study, with NUH, Universities of Nottingham, Cambridge and Auckland and China’s Northeast Normal University, analysing the transcriptomic gene expression levels associated with multiple proliferation features in over 4500 breast cancer cases. Published in *The Lancet Oncology*, the research identified a gene SPAG5 which, was the most influential in the proliferation system and indicates which patients will benefit from chemotherapy, meaning SPAG5 could be a new therapeutic target and a biomarker for the tailoring of breast cancer treatment \( **G5, R3**\). The study identified a total of 34 biomarkers in the breast cancer proliferation system. These markers had a calculated probability of false discovery of less than 1x10<sup>\-73</sup>, further demonstrating the efficacy of the ANNi approach. The ANNi methodology was also successful in specifying influential genes that could be new target markers for childhood sarcomas \( **R4**\); in identifying, via a commercial contract with Syngenta, transcriptomic regulators of ripening in the tomato \( **R5**\); and in modelling the ATR\-CHEK1 system \(critical for genomic stability\) to predict and validate therapeutic targets for breast cancer \( **R6**\).  Ball’s ANN\-based technologies have been applied to numerous clinical questions and the results described in 200\-plus publications.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Impacts on commerce and the economy:** NTU’s spin\-out company Intelligent OMICS Ltd. has commercialised NTU IP and has generated significant revenue and finance investment.** 

 Successful business Intelligent OMICS Ltd has been built through the commercial exploitation of the ANN methods and ANNi machine learning algorithms developed at NTU for *in silico* biomarker and drug target discovery. The company was rebranded as Intelligent OMICS Ltd in 2019 \(see Section 2\) to better reflect the key technological breakthrough that its Intuitive Informed Intelligence \(I3\) machine learning platform, built around the NTU research, could now process 50 million models to a given dataset per hour. This innovation has shortened analysis, that would have previously taken six to seven months, down to two to three weeks. The IP assigned to Intelligent OMICS from NTU includes the patent “Data analysis method and system” \(US8788444 B2, and equivalents\) covering Ball’s machine learning methodologies. The company has attracted £148,000 from Innovate UK \(total grant £873,000, grant reference 101555, Nov 2013 to Jan 2017\). Over the current REF2021 impact period, the company “ *has generated over £230,000 of revenue from third parties – pharma and biotech companies, and UK healthcare\-related institutions*” \( **S1**\), created 4 jobs, and the company has “ *financed and completed over £5,070,000 of research and clinical trials in China”* \( **S1**\). This latter figure, of which £2m pro\-rata has been invested during the period 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2020 \(latest information available within REF2021\), includes investment over 5 years from Hubei provincial government, China. 

 **Impacts on commerce and the economy**: NTU and Intelligent OMICS’ research has stimulated foreign direct investment of £4.5m from United States DTRA for UK Dstl\-led consortia.** 

 Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(Dstl, an executive agency, sponsored by the UK Ministry of Defence\), its military stakeholders, and NTU/Intelligent OMICS Ltd. have received contracts from the US Defence Threat Reduction Agency \(DTRA\) based on the application of NTU and Intelligent OMICS Ltd. machine learning algorithms. The arising IP is being jointly exploited for a civilian context by Ploughshare Innovations, Dstl’s commercial arm, and Intelligent OMICS. The letter of corroboration from a Senior Principal Statistician in the Cyber and Information Division of Dstl states, “ *The research collaboration is focussed on bringing better health care to the military and Prof Graham Ball’s research output is having impact on the defence community* *through rapid diagnosis of infection, particularly trauma induced sepsis*” \( **S2**\), and furthermore, “ *the civilian applications could really assist with the fight against antimicrobial resistance \(AMR\). The methods that have come from the collaboration have identified previously unseen patterns in gene behaviour in the presence of infection and have helped secure international contracts totalling £4.5m in US funding. Contract references DSTLX 1000896368 AM 2, HDTRA1\-14\-24\-FRCWMD\-BAA. A further project PREDICTS HDTRA118\-CBA\-01\-1\-0044 is being negotiated \(Value £2.1M\)*” \( **S2**\). 

 **Impacts on commerce and the economy**: commercial adoption of NTU spin\-out Intelligent OMICS’ algorithms have provided Cumulus Oncology with a significantly more cost\-effective method to target drugs for development, and facilitated their successful £1.7m fund raise.** 

 Using public and private molecular data Ball through Intelligent OMICS has brought about change in practice and generated commercial income through a pathway\-based data mining approach based on Artificial Neural Network Inference ANNi \( **R4**\) algorithmic process that identifies disease/pathway\-specific molecular drivers. This approach replaces the expensive and time\-consuming drug screening process with the modelling of biological pathways in a disease. These highly influential molecules operating in a pathway make excellent biological targets for drugs. As a result, Intelligent OMICS has entered into a strategic partnership with Cumulus Oncology. Work with Cumulus has provided insights into key pathways of interest to the company around DNA repair \(DDR and CHEK1\) in lung cancer. This has enabled Cumulus to define further druggable targets of interest and develop biomarker hypotheses for the drug assets under development, facilitating a recent investment into Cumulus from Private Investors and Scottish Enterprise. A key requirement of this investment was the incorporation of AI methods into the drug discovery process. The CEO of Cumulus Oncology stated, “ *Through our collaboration with Intelligent OMICS, the application of the AI based methods developed by the company has provided Cumulus with insights into key pathways of interest for current and future assets. In turn, this has facilitated a recent successful fund raise of £1.7m by Cumulus Oncology*” \( **S3**\). 

 **Impacts on commerce and the economy:** commercial adoption of NTU spin\-out Intelligent OMICS’ algorithms within Mologic’s new low cost rapid diagnostic tests.** 

 The ANN algorithms developed by Ball have been offered as a service to diagnostics companies, where they are used to rapidly discover optimised panels of biomarkers, incorporate the biomarker panel into a diagnostic model and deliver that model as a piece of software for incorporation onto a diagnostic device. The Chief Scientific Officer of Mologic Ltd, which employs 70 people, stated that, “ *With the help of the machine learning based techniques of Prof Graham Ball and the spin out company Intelligent OMICS Ltd, our company is now able to identify and develop optimised biomarker panels incorporated into point of care diagnostic devices*” \( **S4**\), and furthermore, that “ *The methods and diagnostic interpretation principles coming from Professor Ball’s research have greatly improved the efficiency, sensitivity and specificity of the ground\-breaking diagnostic tests we are developing*” \( **S4**\). In November 2019, Mologic announced it had started a clinical trial \(COPE\-WEL; 263 patients\) to validate its patented, urine\-based, multi\-biomarker self\-test Headstart<sup>®</sup> for the early detection of exacerbations in patients living with moderate to severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease \(COPD\) \( **S4**, **S5**\). Clinical decisions are being made within the COPE\-WEL trial based on the early detection of COPD exacerbation, benefiting patients by providing timely and appropriate interventions. The test can predict the early onset of a COPD exacerbation up to six days before symptom onset, or up to nine days before clinical diagnosis by a healthcare provider. It “ *depends on an associated algorithm developed by Professor Ball*” \( **S4**\). Following proven success from the validation trials, this urine test will be available for launch in 2021. Another complex biomarker test “ *made simple by Prof Ball’s technology”* \( **S4**\) has been developed for sepsis, and in September 2019 Mologic announced it had finished recruiting 550 people to a clinical trial being carried out at University College London Hospitals \( **S6**\). Clinical decisions separating bacterial infections from inflammatory responses where there is no bacterial cause have help managed the way patients are treated leading to patient benefit. 

 **Impact on human health:** trial of a new clinical test for latent tuberculosis in collaboration between NTU spin\-out Intelligent OMICS and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital \(China\), successfully detected latent cases of the disease enabling patients to be treated, and led to phase 2A trials which have been completed.** 

 Ball, through Intelligent OMICS Ltd., has developed and applied algorithms to generate a panel of diagnostic biomarkers which identify the presence of Latent Tuberculosis in otherwise healthy individuals. These inventive methods were developed by Ball and patent protected \(GB201211158A, priority date 22 June 2012, equivalents EP2864499 B1, US2015197806 A1, WO2013190321 A1, “Biomarkers for determining the M. tuberculosis infection status”, Inventor G.R. Ball\). In 2017 Intelligent OMICS Ltd. embarked on clinical evaluation trials in collaboration with Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital \(WPH\) in Hubei Province, China to exploit the predictive capability of Ball’s patented technology \( **S7**\). Initial investment to run the trial was received from the Hubei provincial government, followed within the current REF period by a further 3551 Foreign talent programme grant of £112k \(¥1.0m\) from Wuhan City and Wuhan Biolake development fund \( **S8**\), plus additional match funding investment from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. This project received the backing of Wuhan’s Vice Mayor and the province Consul, who were present at a contract signing ceremony \( **S9**\). The phase 1 trial revealed 6 asymptomatic cases of Latent Tuberculosis, and the phase 2A revealed 50 latent cases, via simple blood test, enabling these patients to receive early treatment. The results of the completed phase 2A Clinical trial are currently being decoded. Wuhan City £224k \(¥2.0m\) funding is already in place to commence a Phase 2B trial that will examine 250 patients.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The research presented in this case study has impacted the practice of a number of organisations seeking to optimise the quality of image/video capture and processing: 

-  Transport for London adopted a standardised approach to setting CCTV recording compression levels on the London bus network, resulting in optimised quality recordings for use in police investigations. 

-  Spectral Edge, a UK start\-up company, changed its practice by adapting the methodology and data from the above project, resulting in the enhancement of the quality of their surveillance and security products and its subsequent acquisition by Apple Inc. 

-  Huawei Ltd, China, streamlined its research and development methods for quantifying phone camera quality, facilitating the development of cost\-effective camera systems that retain excellent image quality. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research of Prof Triantaphillidou, Prof Jarvis and Dr Psarrou focuses on the quantification and optimisation of image and video quality, achieved by investigating the interrelationships between visual perception, camera physics and image signal processing \(ISP\). The Westminster team’s interdisciplinary expertise \(combining physics, engineering, computing, visual science and psychometrics\) makes their research unique in this field. 

 Research carried out during a project led by Triantaphillidou and funded by the UK Home Office identified *for the first time* lower end limits of video compression that would allow for successful face identification for policing purposes \[1,2\]. Rigorous methodologies were pursued for the recording of suitable CCTV footage to bus environments. Large amounts of visual image data were collected from expert and non\-expert user groups \(CCTV analysts, police officers, public\) and subsequently analysed with high accuracy. The research was significant because it accounted for a broad range of image contents that are affected differently by video compression – skin colours, facial proximity, the angle of the face to the camera, and a number of different illumination conditions – and thus resulted in the researchers formulating video compression limits that were adjustable and relevant to the different bus scenarios and conditions. 

 Another strand of research undertaken by Triantaphillidou’s team innovated the measurement of human vision and subsequently developed human vision models that are more suitable than traditional models for use in imaging system design and applications. Aspects of the human visual system, such as visual acuity \(concerned with sharpness/blur\) and sensitivity to different visual frequency ranges, are traditionally measured from viewing designated test charts \(e.g. optometrists’ letter charts, Gabor and sinusoidal functions\). Although such test charts are well established and are universally employed, they do not provide a full account of the visual ability of humans, which, in ordinary seeing, changes in accordance with different levels of local image contrast and complexity. Over the course of a 4\-year project funded by the UK’s Ministry of Defence \(MoD\) that combined human vision modelling, image signal processing and image psychophysics, the research team developed and applied a novel experimental method for measuring human vision in relation to shape, form and detail, by replacing relevant charts with digital images depicting natural scenes. Thousands of hours of observations and rigorous analysis returned results that allowed the team to successfully modify and subsequently validate prevailing mechanistic visual models \[3,4\]. 

 The resulting models better reflect the complexity of the human vision workings when viewing images, thus making them more relevant to the design of imaging products and solutions that produce visual outputs \(e.g. digital cameras, laptop, tablet screens\). This was further demonstrated when the team sought to predict and enable the optimisation of the visual image quality of mobile phone cameras, via a highly productive 6\-month research contract with Huawei Ltd., China \[5\]. 

 The project investigated the relationship between camera sensor resolution \(pixel numbers\) and visual image quality, as displayed in high quality desktops and in handheld displays and perceived by the observers at relevant viewing distances. Large amounts of visual data were again collected, under strictly calibrated viewing conditions, and analysed using a variety of psychometric methods \(image paired comparisons, star rating test, and acceptable/unacceptable quality tests\) and relevant analysis techniques, which allowed results from different experiments to be mapped in a novel manner \[6\]. The research was significant because it demonstrated the extent to which higher camera sensor resolutions benefit image quality, and how optimum camera resolution is intrinsically related to the resolution characteristics of the display devices used for image viewing. The novel analysis of the research results was subsequently adopted by Huawei’s camera evaluation R&D team, as described below.

#  Changing practice at Transport for London \(TfL\) 

 By 2009 it had become apparent that CCTV recordings in London were too often of limited usefulness in the investigation of crime. A key reason for this lack of usefulness was that CCTV system providers to TfL set their cameras in a non\-standardised manner, resulting in the CCTV cameras on board its London buses producing visual imagery of varying quality. It was revealed by the Metropolitan Police Service \(MPS\) that, despite the high expenditure on CCTV in London \(£200m across 10 years\), “for every 1,000 cameras in London, less than one crime is solved per year” \[a\-i\]. 

 Thus, with the participation of the TfL and the funding of a PhD studentship by the Home Office’s Scientific Development Branch \(HOSDB\), Triantaphillidou and her colleagues undertook an applied research project aimed at addressing CCTV quality in this context, **for the first time, resulting in the standardisation of CCTV recording on London buses**. 

 On the basis of their investigation, the team produced a set of standards that would ensure facial recognition from CCTV recordings of bus passengers within the variety of sitting/standing scenarios and lighting conditions relevant to London Buses. It also established a methodology to derive such standards, as described in output \[1\]. TfL implemented the Westminster’s team recommendations for CCTV recorded video in all London buses in 2014. Andrew Hyman, the Analytics Research and Data Outreach Manager at TfL, confirms that the research team’s “ **findings were used to set minimum CCTV quality levels for the CCTV fitted to all new buses**. This was implemented through the ITT Bus Build Specification, which sets out the bus build standards for all new buses as part of the requirements for all bus route tenders. This is mandatory” \[a\-ii\]. This change in practice is such that, as of April 2020, the TfL have approximately 9,000 buses in the fleet that have been fitted with CCTV cameras on the basis of these specifications \[a\-iii\]. 

 The significance of this impact on the relevant TfL London bus practices is that human faces can now be consistently, successfully, identified from CCTV footage across all of the TfL buses, allowing it to function as **a vital tool in the investigation of crime**. Writing in 2018, Hyman notes that “\[g\]ood CCTV significantly increases the chances of detection” and that the TfL’s “Bus CCTV is currently recognized as some of the best quality CCTV covering the public domain, which is one reason why the request for it continues to rise annually” \[a\-ii\]. This increase in demand is confirmed by the MPS who provided the following information \[a\-iv\], which encompasses all bus operators that must use the TfL specifications: 

| **Financial Year** | **2016** | **2017** | **2018** | **2019** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total CCTV Requests \(BUS\) | 10494 | 10985 | 10815 | 11852 |
| Total CCTV requests provided to MPS \(BUS\) | 8408 | 9268 | 9558 | 10723 |
| Retrieval Rate | 80% | 84% | 88% | 90% |

 The increase in MPS demand for access to TfL bus CCTV footage demonstrates the increasing usefulness of this high\-quality imagery in police investigations. While neither the MPS nor the Crown Prosecution Service record data on the number of successful prosecutions that use CCTV within its evidence \[a\-iv, a\-v\], several high\-profile cases demonstrate **the usefulness of Triantaphillidou’s optimised recording standards for obtaining convictions**. 

 Example 1: Demonstrating the effectiveness of the CCTV specifications at night time, a video recording played a vital role in the conviction of four teenagers for their homophobic attack on a lesbian couple in July 2019, which made global headlines following the release of the image of the bloodied women. The judge referred to the CCTV video several times in her judgement, stating that it proved that the suspects “quite clearly targeted this couple” \[a\-vi\]. 

 
Example 2: The quality of the CCTV imagery, as tested under wide\-ranging conditions, was such that the police were able to trace a suspect who stamped a person to death on a bus in March 2018. The camera that was positioned to film the exit door of the bus caught the suspect pressing his hand against the glass \(see image on the right \[a\-vi\]\), allowing the police to lift finger prints from it, leading to his identification, arrest, and eventual conviction \[a\-vi\]. 

 As such, the impact on TfL practice regarding their CCTV recording has also had a positive impact on the organisations 

 seeking to solve crime and prosecute criminals by enabling them to pursue these aims in an effective manner. 

#  Changing practice at an imaging start\-up 

 A secondary impact of the above engagement relates to the upskilling of a researcher who would contribute methodologies and material from the TfL project to the development a UK SME \(small or medium\-sized enterprise\), which in turn led to its purchase by Apple Inc. 

 Dr Anastasia Tsifouti, a then BSc graduate of Westminster and HOSDB employee **,** undertook the aforementioned HOSBD\-sponsored PhD studentship at Westminster under the supervision of Dr Triantaphillidou and aided in the successful enhancement of TfL CCTV, as described above. In Spring 2018 Dr Tsifouti joined Spectral Edge, a SME that focusses on improving pictures and videos on mass market devices on a pixel\-level, via embeddable technology that can be implemented purely in software or in silicon and through techniques incorporating machine learning in real time \[b\-i\]. 

 **Spectral Edge benefited from the methodologies and data obtained from the TfL project**, **which were used to enhance the company’s approach to computational photography.** This occurred both through the skills and knowledge Tsifouti brought to the company from the Westminster project, and Triantaphillidou’s three\-day consultancy on the image quality framework of Spectral Edge’s SE Fusion technology in January 2019 \[b\-ii\]. Subsequently, the TfL work featured in Spectral Edge’s 2019 white paper: *RGB\+IR Real Time Fusion for the Security and Surveillance Industry* \[b\-iii\]. The pre\-2014 bus CCTV images analysed by the Westminster team feature on page 12 of the white paper, which also communicates how Tsifouti’s skills in optimising underexposed, overexposed, and mixed illumination image rendering were used in the development of their flagship SE Fusion technology, which “ensures minimal loss of resolution, while delivering improved contrast, dynamic range and signal\-to\-noise ratio” within its image capture process \[b\-iii, p.12\]. 

 In November 2019, Apple Inc. acquired the SME, with *Bloomberg* suggesting that “Spectral Edge’s technology could contribute to the AI \[Artificial Intelligence\] Apple already uses in its Camera app by continuing to improve the quality of photos in low\-light environments” \[b\-iv\]. The specific ways in which the SpectralEdge innovations have been incorporated into Apple devices cannot be confirmed due to issues of high confidentiality. Nonetheless, following this acquisition the skills base of SpectralEdge staff, which has been positively impacted by Westminster researchers, has **fed into their role within Apple’s Cambridge\-based Camera and Photos Team**, which “provides innovative algorithms and image processing solutions for all of Apples world\-class devices which include the most successful imaging product, iPhone as well as other camera related systems” \[b\-v\]. Dr Tsifouti, now an Apple Inc. employee, attests to the importance of Dr Triantaphillidou to her development within this unique field: “Image quality is an important field in the development of any technology or investigation that relates to imaging. It is an interdisciplinary field, not very well understood by non image quality scientists. In addition, there are not many image quality scientists in the UK. Dr Triantaphillidou has been a great help to my development, throughout my career, as an image quality scientist. Even very recently, in 2019, I requested her consultation on image quality metrics, when I was working for a startup \(SpectralEdge\) that was sold to Apple” \[b\-vi\]. 

#  Changing practice at Huawei 

 In their collaboration with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, China, the Westminster researchers proposed and implemented a successful verification methodology that connected image quality prediction models with customer experience rating methods. Success in this area is confirmed by output \[6\] and testimony which specifies two specific changes of practice that have resulted in the impact of **creating efficiency and cost\-savings within the R&D process of Huawei’s Camera Testing Team**: \[Text removed for publication\] \[c\-i\] \[c\-ii\]. 

 The optimisation of camera image quality on the basis of robust predictions of customer preference, as achieved via the intervention of Triantaphillidou and her team, is **of key significance for Huawei’s commercial strategy in this area.** This is because their ever\-increasing market share in the smartphone sector is driven by their constant technological improvements to their phone cameras. Huawei is second to Samsung in regard to global market share and is the leader of the China market at 42% / 97.8 million shipments in 2019, a 66% increase on the previous year \[c\-iii\]. As *The Verge* explains, this growth is in spite of the smartphone market “experiencing its own form of recession” in recent years, with Huawei being an “exception” because they have “consistently made huge strides between every device release. The company has invested heavily in its camera hardware, which has paid off with terrific performance \(currently unmatched in low light\) and has stirred smartphone owners to hit the ‘upgrade’ button” \[c\-iv\]. As such, Prof Triantaphillidou and her fellow University of Westminster researchers are impacting upon Huawei’s continued commercial expansion in the smartphone market by ensuring they remain the key innovators in the area of camera phone hardware.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The development of a new industry standard for institutional investment cost data, based on research by **Clacher**, has been instrumental in transforming how UK pension fund trustees make decisions when investing pension fund assets. As a member of the Institutional Disclosure Working Group of the Financial Conduct Authority, **Clacher** was responsible for the design of a User Template for the collection and reporting of standardised and aggregated costs and fees. This was accepted by the Financial Conduct Authority and subsequently adopted by the Cost and Transparency Initiative of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association as the industry standard. The standard has a broad range of benefits for the pensions industry. An industry expert confirms that **Clacher’s** research contributed to overall market cost savings of approximately GBP3bn in 2018/19. These and future savings compound and persist and are estimated to reach GBP2tn over the next 35 years through a combination of cost savings and improved decision\-making by trustees. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The costs and fees that are charged by the asset management industry are extremely complex and lack transparency. UK pension fund trustees are responsible for GBP2tn of pension fund assets, equivalent to 105% of UK GDP**Footnote:**

 OECD data shows that UK pension fund assets are the second largest amount of assets in all OECD countries, exceeded only by the United States. 
, and most of this is invested through the asset management industry. Even a small percentage saving on these costs has the potential to have a significant impact on the pension outcomes of millions of UK citizens, because of the scale of pension investments and the significant lifetime compounding effects. Research by Professor Iain **Clacher** has addressed pension fund management issues over the past decade, including a focus on the lack of transparency in the costs associated with pension fund management **\[1**, **2** and **3\].** 

 The lack of transparency in asset investment costs and fees has historically raised industry\-wide concerns about pension fund trustees’ ability to make the best or optimal investment decisions. This can have a detrimental effect on the performance of some funds and ultimately the level of pension individuals receive in retirement. Due to these concerns and a perceived lack of competition, the Financial Conduct Authority \(FCA\) undertook an investigation of competition in the asset management industry \(The Asset Management Market Study – report published June 2017\). This study led the FCA to set up the Institutional Disclosure Working Group \(IDWG\), with a remit to address the transparency problem and create disclosure templates which could be applied to the different types of investments that trustees make for pension funds \(e.g. equities, bonds, and property\). **Clacher’s** research expertise on asset and pension fund management and governance led to him being appointed as a member of the IDWG. 

 The body of research led by **Clacher** formed an evidence\-base for the policy considerations of the IDWG and established the key criteria for **Clacher** to design a User Template for cost and fee disclosure. The foundations of the research began in 2010 with a study by **Clacher** with collaborators in Australia on the investment behaviour and style of portfolio fund managers using data from 174 Australian mutual funds for the period January 1990 to June 2005 **\[1\]**. This was followed by a study with collaborators at Leeds, Loughborough and Strathclyde **\(i\)** that developed and tested a new approach to assess Defined Benefit pension plan solvency risk in the presence of extreme market movements. It found that the standard assumption of constant discount rates leads to dramatic underestimation of future projections of pension plan solvency risk. The results have important implications for those with responsibility for balancing risk against expected return when seeking to improve the current poor funding positions of Defined Benefit pension schemes **\[2\]**. 

 In 2018, Aon, a global professional services firm in the field of risk, retirement and health, commissioned **Clacher** to conduct a research project on pensions working with colleagues from the Centre for Decision Research at Leeds. The aim of the research was to investigate whether trustees were able to make more effective decisions if they were given more complex and enhanced disclosures of the costs of asset management. The research was relevant to Aon’s core business as well as being beneficial for the wider pensions industry. An online survey, which generated just under 200 responses from pension trustees of schemes of all sizes, was the first systematic investigation of whether trustees can select the best investment when presented with increasingly granular and complex combinations of costs and fees, and whether trustees understood the indirect costs of asset management. The findings from this research, published in an industry report: *Costs, fees, and trustee decision\-making* **\[4\]**, demonstrated that trustees understood explicit net of fees options i.e. selecting the best fund when presented with explicit cost and performance data. However, trustees of smaller schemes did not perform as well as trustees of larger schemes. A crucial research finding was that trustees were less familiar with hidden fees, and that this lack of understanding was much worse for trustees of small schemes. These findings were important as they revealed that many trustees struggle with more complex cost and fee disclosures **\[4\]** and this had implications for the design of interventions aimed at assisting the investment decision\-making process. 

 **Clacher’s** contribution to the IDWG included his leadership of a sub\-group that was set up to design a User Template, which aggregates complex granular data into a more useable format for trustees to make effective decisions. To build this template **Clacher** undertook further research on trustees, in collaboration with Aon, to empirically validate the optimal structure of the User Template, which was tested with different formats e.g. adding costs back to net performance to arrive at gross performance vs deducting costs from gross performance to arrive at net performance. **Clacher’s** recommendations for the design of the final User Template included the cost categories, the order and structure of the template, and crucially, the presentation of both the absolute value of costs and fees as well as the percentage charge against assets, because the absolute value of the costs incurred increases their salience to the trustees. 

 Subsequent research, funded by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries **\(ii\)** and **\(iii\)**, with Aon as an industry partner, showed empirically that the core issues examined in the design of the User Template around the format and presentation of information to trustees is critical, as the format and presentation of information impacts the quality of trustee decision\-making. This research moved from the action\-research approach taken for the IDWG to a more scientifically rigorous experimental approach that tested the influence that extraneous non\-financial information can have on the financial decisions of trustees, by manipulating the presentation of choice menus. Trustees were influenced by changes to the menu item mix, context, and layout. It was found that these subtle variations in the presentation of options influence decisions and can lead to poor\-quality decisions, impacting on pension fund performance **\[3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research provided more informed choices for pension fund trustees and a heightened awareness of the components of fund returns and specifically cost structures. This has increased awareness in trustee boards of not only fee structures but return measurement overall. This is a major development for the management of savings and investments, with significant economic impacts and repercussions for pension holders and investors. 

 **Development and regulatory adoption of a new industry standard** 

 **Clacher’s** appointment by the FCA to the board of the IDWG **\[A\]** was a key step in applying his research knowledge to support the development of the new industry standard for disclosure of institutional investment cost data. The Chairman of the IDWG commented: 

 *“The board \[of the IDWG\] had 32 members from the asset management and pension fund worlds, alongside regulators \(both national and international\), and various union representatives. All members were senior executives in their relevant companies. Dr Clacher was the independent pension expert and sole academic representative on the Board, and was the only candidate selected by the FCA from a large pool of applicants. Dr Clacher was invaluable to this enquiry and led a team of senior pension consultants to design the User Template, one of the three data standards that were the structured output of the enquiry.”* **\[B\]** 

 The final set of hierarchical templates, including the User Template, were presented in the IDWG final report **\[C\]**. This report explains that the User Template was *“designed to form the basis of better and more involved conversations between trustees, their investment consultants, and their asset managers.”* It continues: *“The proposed* \[User\] *template therefore aggregates data from the Account level template into broad categories of costs and fees for trustees to understand the costs incurred from the running of the overall fund or a specific asset class”* **\[C\]**.  An advantage of the User Template is that it allows key costs to be clearly tracked over time and if there is a significant change in a cost category then trustees will be able to investigate what caused the shift **\[C, D\]**. The results of the testing of the User Template were presented by **Clacher** to the FCA and an audience from across the asset management industry in January 2018 **\[B\]**. 

 A letter from the Interim Chief Executive of the FCA states: *“In July 2018, the FCA endorsed the proposals of the IDWG, including the User Template developed by Dr Clacher, and it is now included in a new industry standard on costs and fees disclosure.”* **\[E\]** 

 The Interim Chief Executive of the FCA confirms that the benefits of the User Template for the industry are that it has improved institutional investors’ access to key data. Furthermore, as a result of the aggregation of data into broad categories of costs and fees and the ability to segment by asset class or manager, trustees are now more likely to achieve their investment goals through better, more informed selection of managers and are in a better position to challenge and hold asset managers to account where costs are out of line with expectations **\[E\]**. 

 Subsequently, the User Template has been rolled out as part of the Cost and Transparency Initiative \(CTI\) of the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association \(PLSA\). The PLSA now manages the standards and templates that were built by the IDWG in collaboration with the Scheme Advisory Board \(SAB\) of the Local Government Pension Scheme \(LGPS\) of England and Wales and the Investment Association \(IA\) \(the trade body that represents investment manager and asset management firms in the UK\) **\[E\]**. 

####  Industry application and estimated cost savings 

 The PLSA website on the CTI \(the industry standard\) provides case study evidence that explains the implementation of the standard and the benefits to pension fund trustees **\[F\]**. The website includes four case studies by pension schemes, outlining the benefits of CTI: 

-  National Grid UK Pension Scheme: Now into the third year of using the CTI framework with an external data provider, they can provide their trustees with much more detailed management information and trend analysis, enabling them to assess and challenge themselves on achieving value for money **\[F\]**. 

-  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Pension Fund: The scheme has been collecting cost data for eight years.  However, the CEO stated that the introduction of the industry\-standard CTI templates, rather than a bespoke process, reduces the time to collect the data from asset managers from two weeks to around two hours and gives the ability to benchmark fund costs accurately against other schemes **\[F\]**. 

-  RPMI Railpen: From their own data collection in 2011, they believed their costs to be GBP80m per annum. However, after using CTI disclosure in 2019, they found that there was an additional GBP210m per annum of costs representing 1.8% of asset value. They estimate that they have been able to make a percentage point saving in annual costs with the Finance Director of the scheme advocating the CTI templates as they are now the industry standard for schemes to know what their costs are **\[F\]**. 

-  West Midlands Pension Fund: The Director of Pensions states that the CTI has two key advantages over their own earlier in\-house approach. First, it captures a broader range of costs, in a standard format. Second, it makes it easier for the investment community to respond \(i.e. provide cost data\) – reflected in the rate and volume of responses since using the CTI. They now have in\-depth information on their asset management costs and fees on over 90% of their assets **\[F\]**. 

 CTI Board member and Chair of the Association of Consulting Actuaries highlights that the templates are not only beneficial for large schemes but have been even more helpful and significant to smaller schemes. Smaller schemes do not have the governance budget to employ Chief Investment Officers and in\-house investment teams. The templates have therefore enabled trustees of smaller schemes to better explain cost data to clients, improving decision\-making **\[F\]**. 

 Rather than collect their own data directly, most pension funds use a data service provider that collects large volumes of comparable data from billions of pounds of pension fund assets using the CTI templates. ClearGlass, for example, verifies this data for accuracy and provides additional services e.g., benchmarking. A further benefit of collecting data in the CTI format is the very powerful ability to examine trends over time **\[F** – video with Chairman, Clearglass and Product Specialist, Caceis \(collectively holding data on GBP575bn of asset funds\) **\]**. Trustees are able to not only understand their costs today, but they can also track them through time to make sure that they remain under control. The Interim Chief Executive, FCA commented: 

 “*More broadly, it* \[the IDWG templates including the User Template\] *has been taken up by significant parts of the market through commercial organisations such as ClearGlass, bringing transparency to trillions of pounds of investment in UK pension funds”.* **\[E\]** 

 **Clacher’s** research has contributed significantly to delivering transparency and cost savings to pension fund investments.  The industry expert, Chairman of Clearglass \(who is also the former IDWG Chair, Chairman of Fintech North, and Fintech Envoy for England for the UK Treasury\) estimates the initial savings from the industry standard in the year 2018/19 to be in the range of GBP2tn to GBP3tn. This value is arrived at based on verified cost savings from the Clearglass platform of GBP2bn for their clients and extrapolated, to give a conservative estimate for the whole of market impact. 

 *“As a result of the disclosure* \[User\] *template becoming the industry standard, for our pension fund clients, the cost savings amount to GBP2 billion in 2018/19… the overall cost savings to the market are of the order of GBP3 billion in 2018/19. Crucially, these are not one\-off savings, these savings compound and persist. The overall cost savings to UK pensions over the next 35 years, the estimated time for defined benefit schemes to be run\-off, will in aggregate approach GBP2 trillion through a combination of cost savings and improved decision\-making by trustees.”* **\[B\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Novel signal/image analysis and machine learning methods have been developed and efficiently implemented into different applications and devices even with low computational capabilities. Highly innovative UWS research is achieving significant impact in several areas including electronics and computing industries, where top multinational companies such as Cirrus Logic and SME’s like Codeplay Software Ltd; MODO Systems Ltd; and Lumen Research Ltd implemented our methods to realise socio\-economic benefits. The applicability of our developments has gained recognition from the Government, implementations in the Health and Social Care sector and have informed the standardisation and open access community.

 **2. Underpinning Research** 

 **The Affective and Human Computing for Smart Environment \(AHCSE\)** research centre aims at the creation of state\-of\-the\-art knowledge in signal processing \(1D/2D\) and machine learning, with a specific focus on making all our developments applicable in real life challenging scenarios. Combining all the disciplines, we have created accurate, robust and efficient algorithms and applications: 

 **Emotion recognition** by physiological signals \(EEG, and ECG\) and implemented in Emotional Gym for social care sector; we developed efficient and robust algorithms for automated recognition of human affect \(Emotion\). To address it, we created a **DREAMER, a pioneering open access database** consisting of recordings of EEG and ECG signals captured while audio\-visual stimuli was presented to the participants in order to elicit specific emotions **\[3.1\].** Portable, wearable, and wireless devices were used for both the EEG and ECG capture allowing the evaluation of affect recognition algorithms on signals that can be conveniently captured in everyday scenarios, providing the means to integrate affect computing methods into a wide variety of tasks. After assessing the quality of the participants’ ratings, a baseline for this database was then established by evaluating EEG and ECG\-based features through participant\-wise supervised classification experiments. To demonstrate the feasibility of integrating affective computing methods to everyday applications **\[3.2\]** through the use of portable/wearable equipment like Emotional Gym project. The initial research was carried out through an innovation grant **funded by Loretto Care** and followed by the research grant from **Construction Scotland Innovation Centre** with **Wheatley group**, a leading and award\-winning provider of care and support services **\[3.I\].** 

 **Continuous real\-time monitoring of respiratory patients** in connected health scenarios by detecting and analysing cough episodes from audio signals acquired in challenging noisy scenarios; we proposed a more robust approach to cough detection with high sensitivity \(up to 88.51%\) and specificity \(up to 99.77%\) in a variety of noisy environments **\[3.3\]** by considering two dimensional spectrograms and feature extraction techniques. However, the implementation of such methods together with easily customisable machine learning algorithms resulted in fast battery drainage from the mobile device \(less than 2 hours\), so, we proposed efficient machine learning implementations for the smartphone that offers accuracy of more than 93% when continuously monitoring cough for 48 hours while keeping the smartphone at full functionality **\[3.4\].** The original research was carried out during a ground\-breaking Smartcough project funded by the Scottish Funding Council \(SFC\) **\[3.A\].** We exploited the use of this technology for **Early Detection of Lung Cancer funded by Cancer Research UK \[3.B\].** 

 Other major research strands include: **video decoder optimisation,** which is based on the parallel decoder architecture for latest video coding standard High Efficiency Video Codec \(HEVC\) \(in 2014\) that was proposed for mobile platforms. In addition, the subjective and objective quality evaluation of HEVC standard was conducted under the global standardisation body MPEG, a working group within the International Organization for Standardization \(ISO\) and the International Electrotechnical Commission \(ICE\). MPEG is responsible for the development of international standards for compression, decompression, processing, and coded representation of moving pictures, audio and their combination **\[3.5, 3.C, 3.G\].** **Real\-time content based image retrieval \(CBIR\) framework** has been developed based on the highly efficient deep learning within mobile platform **\[3.6\];** Furthermore, alongside the CBIR framework, a state\-of\-the\-art person identification and recognition framework was developed and implemented within Mobile platform **\[3.D, 3.F, 3.I\].** The research team has also developed **the first real\-time mobile eye tracking framework** based on deep learning. It implements the stages of data acquisition, large data storage, data cleansing and mining, feature extraction, developing new machine learning models, testing these models, adjusting the parameters of the models and deploying the newly invented AI models in a distributed environment **\[3.E\].**

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Significant socio\-economic impacts have been achieved by the UWS research team. 

 <ins> **Societal Impact:**</ins> **Pioneering new care home solution** for the elderly has been developed directly from our research **\[5.9\]**. Our **Emotional Gym solution** deployed at two different care home sites **funded by Construction Scotland Innovation Centre \(CSIC\) and Loretto Care** has enabled care home residents to improve their mobility, exercise and stay physically active for longer periods. Our research has created **new emotional technology driven health and care management systems** and its originality and reach have been recognised in 2018 with the following **awards:** 

 • **Laing Buisson Awards**: Innovation & Leaders Category – Innovation in Care Award 

 • **Holyrood Connect Digital Health and Care Awards** \- Digital Innovation Award 

 Our expertise in mobile app development and signal processing has resulted in the development of a novel publicly available mobile app \- **Stay Safe Scotland** in partnership with the **Council of Ethnic Minority Voluntary Sector Organisations \(CEMVO\)** Scotland, with **funding from the Scottish Government** to help tackle the disproportionate number of ethnic minority people affected by Covid\-19 \[5.10\]. The app seeks to overcome major barriers faced by **ethnic minority communities** in Scotland by providing social distancing guidelines in a variety of different languages and **predicting** footfall data at nearly 100 supermarkets throughout Scotland to help users schedule visits at quieter times, and to avoid queuing and overcrowding. 

 <ins> **Public Impact:**</ins> Loretto Care and Wheatley Group have implemented our life changing research on **emotion recognition** based on physiological signals, resulting in the development of an innovative **stationary exercise bike integrated with in\-house developed super\-interactive games** to monitor health and wellbeing of general public with limited mobility \(e.g. elderly people\). Our results have shown that more than 30% residents in care homes are highly likely to participate in physical activities and sports thereby improving the health and wellbeing of the public. 

 **Over 93% accuracy** has been achieved by using our pioneering **SmartCough App** for detecting cough and enabled the health service operators and general public to **monitor the respiratory conditions remotely, enabling accurate prediction of changes in the severity in respiratory diseases \[5.10\].** Our robust and energy efficient smartphone\-based cough detector mobile app exploits **some advanced machines learning algorithms.** 

 <ins> **Knowledge Impact**</ins>: Our emotion recognition research has produced **first ever publicly available open source dataset \(DREAMER\)** that can be used to create new industrial research and development programmes based on physiological signals **\[5.1\].** After its publication \(https://zenodo.org/record/546113\), the dataset has attracted a significant attention from the international professional audiences and researchers \(e.g. Facebook/Occulus\). Up until 21/08/2020, 3757 requests for access to the dataset had been made via the “zenodo.org” platform, 5000 full text views of the publication via the “IEEE Xplore” platform. 

 Furthermore, the work on video quality evaluation has been recognised worldwide and accelerated the verification of the HEVC video coding standard. The outcome of this research was two contribution to MPEG standard **\[5.3\]** and has been selected for the **Best of IET and IBC papers** **\[5.2\]** and awarded with the **Best Paper Award** of IEEE Transaction of Circuit and System for Video Technology **\[5.2\]** and downloaded by more than 21,000. 

 <ins> **Economic Impact**</ins>: **Codeplay Software Ltd** has achieved **x10 predicted impact in financial terms and a doubling of business size \(headcount\)**, gain international level recognition in the field of AI positioning them along Google, Intel, Arm, NVIDIA and resulting in both significant business growth \(e.g. company has established long term collaborative partnerships with the ARM, Intel, Imagination and Renesas **\[5.6\]**\) and accrued significant profit \(e.g. company awarded with seven\-figure contract during the period of the KTP project\). This global success directly resulted from the InnovateUK funded project with the UWS research team. 

 Our cloud computing project with **MODO Ltd** funded by Innovate UK has integrated an advanced machine algorithm \(e.g. CBIR and person identification with MODO’s core product architecture\) and thereby enhanced an overall customer proposition. Our results have enabled the company to secure a **six\-figure investment** and has significantly raised the company’s valuation and profile for future growth **\[5.4\].** This project received top **“outstanding” rating by Innovate UK** **\[5.5\].** 

 **Lumen Ltd.** have leveraged AI/ML within its innovative product that helps to generate **50% more revenue and almost doubling the headcount** **\[5.7\]** as a result of the research with UWS. This huge success stems from the InnovateUK\-funded project that has enabled our team to develop the first mobile eye tracking framework on the market. This real\-time mobile eye tracking framework is based on deep learning and has generated significant industry interest, boosting Lumen’s visibility and market share. 

 Significant InnovateUK successes have since substantially increased industry interest in pioneering UWS research, resulting in three further KTP projects \( **VMS**, **SERIC** with **Education Scotland**\), and **Kibble**\) as well as research interest demonstrated in two Erasmus\+ projects \(ATHIKA and Remote Health Monitoring\) 

 The above industry\-focused successes of the team and its leadership have been crowned with the **Knowledge Exchange Champion award 2020** **\[5.8\]** awarded to **Ramzan** for contributing to over GBP15,000,000 to UK economy via 8 KTPs projects with leading industrial and commercial partners in the UK.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Physical inactivity and urbanisation are global public health concerns. The Physical Activity Exchange \(PAEx\) has completed surveillance, intervention and evaluation research related to physical activity \(PA\) for over 25 years.  This has been translated into a Global Active City \(GAC\) movement with international reach through; \(1\) project certification standards, \(2\) change in knowledge, policy and programmes within pilot project cities \(5.8 million residents\), \(3\) increases in PA in the participating cities. These changes have led to reductions in inactivity and demonstrated substantial associated economic benefits with Liverpool, for example, one of the 7 accredited GACs reducing inactivity from 27.4% in 2015 to 23.5% in 2018. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The PAEx has produced >300 peer\-reviewed articles between 2000\-2020. This body of work includes evidence that has made a distinct and material difference by directly influencing policy and practice within Liverpool, where our research was integral to the novel Liverpool Active City programme \(LAC, 2005\-present\) and globally via the Global Active City project \(GAC, 2015\-present\). The GAC project was purposefully modelled on the LAC, where PAEx research informed policy \(e.g., SportsLinx\) and evaluated actions \(e.g., Active Play, A\-CLASS\). This research has been used throughout the set\-up and running of the GAC project. 

 The information below details three research themes, that embody PAEx research that has prompted change and has driven and influenced the developments both within GAC and LAC for creating this world\-wide movement. 

 Surveillance: Liverpool City Council originally engaged PAEx staff to develop a robust talent ID sports pathway, but this timing corresponded with concerns around child health in the city. The SportsLinx project evolved into health surveillance research in 1998. This programme of work produced >40 peer\-reviewed research studies including the specific example output by Boddy et al. \(2010\). Novel data from this long\-term study \(14 years\) in >65,000 schoolchildren revealed significant increases in childhood obesity, changes in food intake and significant reductions in other aspects of health, including cardiorespiratory fitness. This was the first data of this nature in the UK and was directly fed back into Liverpool City Council and the LAC programme as well as the GAC project. By demonstrating areas of inequality this changed resource allocation and policy decisions. 

 Physical activity interventions and evaluation: A key area of PAEx research is the co\-production of theory\-based interventions and robust evaluation. The PAEx has conducted a range of interventions, including weight management programmes, school\-based projects and workplace health programmes. One example of our evaluation research is Active Play. Evidence from SportsLinx highlighted the need to promote PA, in particular during the early years. Active Play was funded by LAC to evaluate a PA intervention in pre\-school children. Findings from this work published in O’Dwyer et al. \(2012\) described post\-intervention improvements in sedentary time and total PA. This evidence was part of the formal LAC evaluation and informed service/resource allocation and has been used in GAC activity. 

 Another example intervention and evaluation research programme has focussed on workplace health. Desk based workers spend the majority of their time sitting. Graves et al. \(2015\) conducted an RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of using height\-adjustable workstations to reduce sitting time in office workers. The study described significant declines in sitting time and total cholesterol and increases in standing time in the intervention group. This research provided evidence of the utility of workplace interventions and potentially effective ways to improve health for organisations, employers and public health professionals within an urban office setting and is applicable globally. 

 Physical activity measurement: A key PAEx research area that underpinned the GAC programme is PA measurement and the use of novel methods to understand PA behaviours. One key research programme explored children’s out of school PA as an under\-researched area of the literature and key area to target for PA interventions. Noonan et al. \(2016\) detailed a novel method to examine children’s PA behaviours and perceptions using the ‘Write, Draw, Show and Tell’ approach. This method has been widely cited and employed in practice, providing a way to involve the child’s ‘voice’ within projects and evaluations, gaining rich insight into preferences, perceptions and PA behaviours. 

 Technical issues are challenging when attempting to measure PA using devices such as accelerometers. Methodological advances regarding device\-based assessments of PA is a key area of PAEx research that has been used within GAC. In particular, raw accelerometer data processing offers greater comparability between studies and improved researcher flexibility/control over decision making. The Fairclough et al. \(2016\) study was the first to examine counts vs raw accelerometer metrics and two monitor placement sites in children. The study showed significant differences in PA levels according to raw and counts based processing from hip and wrist monitors. This study also highlighted significant differences in compliance. This evidence has been widely used and has been integrated into a range of training GAC workshops. 

 Whilst accelerometers in theory provide device\-based assessments of PA, they are expensive and require technical expertise. Self\-reported tools represent a feasible method of estimating PA on a population level but are susceptible to bias. Fairclough et al. \(2019\) detailed the calibration \(against device\-based measures\) and validation of the Youth Physical Activity Profile for use in the England. This provides a more accurate self\-report tool to assess physical activity in youth on a population level. This work has been integrated into PA monitoring training and underpinned the successful funding application for work with the city of Buenos Aires.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The PAEx have a strategic approach to translation with evidence disseminated locally to project partners, to policy makers within the Local Authority and NHS as well as more broadly via international conferences, journal articles and published reports. We are able to disseminate directly into LCC via formal Board roles and the GAC project as the Academic Partner alongside The Association for International Sport for All \(TAFISA\), Evaleo \(a non\-profit sustainable health organisation\) and the International Olympic Committee \(IOC\). Evidence of change, including its significance and reach are outlined below, and the process, beneficiaries and nature of the impact are explained. 

 **Process and pathways to Impact:** PAEx projects and outputs underpinned and evaluated the Liverpool Active City strategy \(LAC, 2005\-present, **\[EV1\]**, REFERENCES 1\-4\). Our work with LAC led directly to PAEx supporting collaborative programme delivery with TAFISA \(e.g., Triple AC, 2012\-present **\[EV2\]**\). This relationship was the precursor to the Global Active City project \(GAC, 2015\-present\) which is purposefully modelled on LAC. In 2015, as the **academic partner for GAC**, PAEx staff **Boddy**, **Knowles** and **George** were appointed as Expert Advisors **\[EV3\]** to provide continuous input to the project \(2015\- to present\). Marsden, jointly funded by LJMU and GAC, was appointed as the **Director of the GAC** development programme and continues as an International Active City Advocacy and Development Officer at LJMU working in tandem with TAFISA. These staff, their expertise and organisational roles that informed and influenced developments provide a **clear and direct link** between our research and the GAC initiative as well as the cities and organisations involved in the GAC project.  For example, the GAC project involves an introductory workshop, a diagnostic visit/report, the formation of a Physical Activity and Sport for All alliance \(PASA\) and strategy, and an independent audit. PAEx research was integrated into, shaped and supported delivery in all stages of this process. In the audit each city must meet an ISO compatible standard to achieve GAC status. PAEx research was used as underpinning evidence during the development of the ISO compatible standard and provided illustrative case studies for cities to inform their own research/evaluation plans \(directly linked to REFERENCES 1\-6\). For example, Boddy, Knowles and George provided direct feedback on all iterations of the ISO compatible standards \(2016\), attended 2 expert meetings and the 2016 final consultation event when standards were finalised **\[EV4\]**. 

 The PAEx delivers expert advice and support to GAC candidate cities \(involving municipal representatives, academics, clinicians/health practitioners\) on a bespoke basis, including leading workshops that utilise PAEx research throughout. During the GAC project \(2016\-to date\), our research was used to highlight the importance of PA promotion and explain methods used to conduct health surveillance \(REFERENCE 1 **EV5**\), support cities in identifying KPIs and how to evaluate interventions \(REFERENCES 1\-3, **EV5**, **EV6**\), and integrated within PA measurement training central to the work with Buenos Aires \(REFERENCES 4\-6, **EV5**\). Research was integrated within 2 introductory workshops, 11 training workshops, 10 diagnostic visits and reports, 7 conferences/congresses, and written documents including case studies. The diagnostic report for Havana, Cuba is presented as an example and directly refers to PAEx research \(REFERENCE 3 and SportsLinx, **EV7**\) as part of the guidance for the development of evaluation processes. 

 Since Buenos Aires gained GAC accreditation status in 2018, PAEx have continued to work closely with relevant teams in the city to further develop their research/evaluation strategy. One Buenos Aires city government delegate attended a workshop on evidence\-based practice in Liverpool in 2018. Following the success of that workshop we hosted six delegates at LJMU \(3 x government employees, 3 x academics\) to provide bespoke training on PA measurement and evaluation in May 2019. In **EV5** Buenos Aires staff reflect on the impact of specific PAEx research \(REFERENCE 6\) in this process. In 2019 we submitted a successful collaborative research funding proposal and data collection was due to commence in March 2020. This has been suspended during the Covid\-19 pandemic but is now planned for September 2021. 

 **Beneficiaries:** For the certification process all candidate GAC cities receive the ISO standards and accompanying documents \(total to date=21\).  In the pilot/development project, **7 cities across 7 countries** were successfully certified as GACs in 2018. From the initial introductory meetings held in 2016, cities established a multi\-sector PASA Alliance and developed a PASA strategy to meet the accreditation requirements. As an example, Buenos Aires provide testimony **\[EV5\]** that their work was informed by PAEx research \(REFERENCES 1,3,6\) and led to the development of an Alliance that includes over 40 organisations spanning government, universities, professional sports clubs, charities, healthcare providers and industrial partners **\[EV5\]**. Therefore, a wide range of organisations and individuals are beneficiaries of the certification process. 

 The beneficiaries of the impact of GAC currently include **over 5.8 million citizens** from the original 7 certified cities. The professionals in each city involved in the GAC process also benefit in terms of knowledge, expertise and potential career enhancement. **Direct change** has occurred for city professionals and citizens. For the specific example of Buenos Aires, LJMU, Univiersidad Favaloro and the City Government of Buenos Aires signed letters of intent in 2019 to continue long\-term collaborative work around PA, cardiovascular health and the sport and exercise sciences **\[EV5\]**. 

 Partner organisations are beneficiaries as well. LJMU was acknowledged in 2020 with the award of the **TAFISA Mission 2030 Academia Award** on the basis of contribution to the GAC programme: ‘Their \[LJMU\] openness and readiness to share their expertise with the world, and train other stakeholders, universities and cities worldwide to promote physical activity make them a logical recipient of the award’. **\[EV2, EV8a\]**. TAFISA has identified Active Cities as key theme in the TAFISA Mission 2030 and has thus changed its policy focus **\[EV8b, c\]**. 

 <ins> **Nature</ins> <ins>and extent</ins> <ins>of impact:**</ins>  All accredited GACs have developed the necessary systems and policies to satisfy accreditation requirements designed to promote PASA for all of their citizens. This includes the PASA alliance, **active city policies \[EV9\]**, mass participation events, and PA programmes. Therefore, the certification process and associated changes at the municipal level have impacted upon **society**, **public policy** and **services** and the **sport sector**. Immediate impacts include employment opportunities within the PASA or organisations \(e.g., 2 new full\-time jobs in Buenos Aires, Argentina, **\[EV5\]**\) thus **benefitting the economy** and changes to funding structures \(e.g., the budget for the Sports Department was raised from € 3.2 million to 4 million in Graz, \[partner city\] **\[EV6\]**\). 

 The GAC process and city\-specific work has resulted in the **promotion of PA opportunities**, for example through **policies** and **environmental changes** \(e.g., new walking routes in Lausanne, **\[EV6, EV8d\]** and ‘radical’ urban planning initiatives in Hamburg **\[EV8e\]**\). Post workshop feedback has also described the positive impact of PAEx research on cities, for example feedback from Lausanne: ‘The evidence presented \(REFERENCES 1\-6\) have helped to demonstrate the importance to act in the field of PASA at a local level’ **\[EV6\]**. 

 The GAC certified city of Liverpool provides evidence of **longer\-term change** of the Active City model by demonstrating **reduced levels of inactivity** \(27.4% in 2015 to 23.5% in 2018\) thus benefitting **health**, **increased economic benefits associated with health** \(from £417.9 million in 2015 to £456 million in 2018\) and **increases in the total economic value of sport** \(£157.6 million in 2015 to £226.8 million in 2018\) **\[EV10\]**. Liverpool is one of 7 certified cities therefore the **long\-term** cumulative **educational**, **environmental**, **economic** and **health impacts** of GAC are likely to be substantial and demonstrates the **extensive** and **worldwide reach** of this impact.
