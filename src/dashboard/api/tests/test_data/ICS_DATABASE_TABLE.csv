 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Professor Papageorgiadis developed an index of patent enforcement strength leading to its adoption by intellectual property practitioners and policy\-makers. The Patent Enforcement Index \(PEI\) captures patent enforcement strength volatility and differences across 51 countries, providing enhanced understanding of how national patent enforcement systems operate and leading to patent enforcement becoming a major factor in decisions relating to the filing of patents and the development of national patent systems. Testifying to the impact of the research, PEI is now used by: i\) in\-house patent managers from 26 multinational companies \(12 industries\) to inform and change their patent filing decision making; ii\) 16 external patent attorneys to educate global clients about patent enforcement risk and promote patent filing in specific countries; and iii\) policymakers from 5 countries to evaluate their countries’ patent enforcement performance and develop evidence informed policies. The significance and global reach of the research impact stretches across corporate patent management practices and policymaking in 19 countries across 4 continents.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Papageorgiadis’ research on measuring the Strength of Patent Enforcement \(SPE\) and its impact on international business strategy has addressed misplaced theoretical assumptions that when a country adopts patent laws then these are immediately and uniformly enforced by its agencies, courts, police and customs organizations. Professor Papageorgiadis’ initial research index focused on the years 1998\-2011 and captured only some of the factors relevant to patent enforcement. His subsequent research at Liverpool addressed gaps in understanding and a revised Patent Enforcement Index \(PEI\) for the years 1998\-2017 identified previously uncaptured patent enforcement strength volatility and differences across 51 countries \(3.1\). 

 The PEI illustrates unexpected SPE volatility and major differences across 51 countries. PEI’s new evidence and accompanying dataset challenge established assumptions about the functioning of national patent systems and opened new avenues for theoretical and empirical studies with implications for international business strategy. These improvements are encapsulated in Publication output 3.1 which articulates the research and the PEI, measuring SPE in 51 countries for the years 1998\-2017. Publication outputs 3.2\-3.6 applied PEI and each addressed a gap in understanding the impact of cross\-country SPE differences on international business strategy. The studies contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the contemporary context of international patent systems and the direct impact of SPE on innovation, Foreign Direct Investment \(FDI\) and country entry mode choice. 

 From this body of research there are two main insights underpinning the impact of this research. 

 **Patent enforcement strength levels differ between countries** \(3.1\). To measure national SPE levels, Professor Papageorgiadis’ framework defines and maps the transactions costs that patent owners face when enforcing patents. He calculates PEI scores for 51 countries by applying the SPE framework using newly available firm and country level patent litigation and enforcement data. PEI reveals that national SPE varies significantly between countries and showcases previously uncaptured volatility in SPE within and between countries. PEI provides objective and measurable data evidencing the exact differences in SPE across countries and over time. Contrary to anecdotal evidence and established assumptions, PEI indicates that: a\) companies need to customize their patent filing strategies in different countries so that they can mitigate risk and control uncertainty from variations in SPE; and b\) policymakers need to consider their countries’ SPE performance distinctly from other aspects of the patent system and develop SPE specific policymaking actions. 

 **Global patent enforcement variability influences international business strategy** Professor Papageorgiadis’ publications changed understanding regarding the impact of SPE on international business strategies \(3.2\-3.6\). The studies found that SPE levels have: i\) a U\-shaped effect on innovation activity; ii\) a positive effect on attracting Chinese and US FDI, iii\) a varied effect on the entry mode choice of firms from BRICS countries \(Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa\) into Europe, and iv\) a positive effect on economic growth. This research insight indicates that: companies need to customize their patent protection strategies to fit the level of risk from intellectual property theft in each country, and that policymakers improving SPE can help their country attract FDI. 

 The publications and accompanying index data were made freely available in the Journal of World Business’s website with gold open access status. The pre\-publication version of the index and PEI related infographics were also made available for download from the PEI dedicated webpages of the University of Liverpool under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 international license that allows users to freely copy, redistribute, adapt, remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially. This accessibility has been critical to its adoption by parties to patent management and policy making at firm, industry and national levels.

###  Pathway to PEI Impact 

 Resulting from research by Professor Papageorgiadis, PEI is now a tool used by in\-house company patent managers, external patent attorney professionals and national patent policy makers in 19 countries to objectively and reliably assess national patent enforcement strength and inform decision and policy making. 

 The progress from research to widespread adoption of PEI has followed dissemination of the research and engagement activity with potential beneficiaries during 2014\-2020 via several pathways: 

1.  Keynote speeches and presentations at 11 patent practitioner and policymaking conferences directly engaging with 2500\+ potential beneficiaries, such as his delivery of a keynote speech at the European Patent Office. 

1.  100\+ posts with commentaries and infographics on Twitter and LinkedIn, directly engaging with beneficiaries internationally. 

1.  A dedicated University of Liverpool webpage \(www.liverpool.ac.uk/patent\-systems\) showcasing PEI, research insights and non\-technical articles published in international media, are testament to the impact of PEI. 

###  4.1 Corporate patent strategy and decision\-making 

 Evidence from 26 multinational companies from 13 countries and 12 industries, ranging from manufacturing, to medical, to financial services \(5.1\), illustrate how the availability and access to PEI under gold open access and Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 international license changed the behaviour of in\-house patent managers when making decisions about their international patent portfolio strategy. Managers screen countries to make decisions about registering every one of their granted patents. Pruning a global patent portfolio is an important economic decision that saves and redistributes economic resources and optimizes commercial risk exposure. 

 Exemplifying this breadth and depth of research impact, the Director of IP of a Swedish firm in the forest and gardening industry states he uses PEI to “ *better prioritize selection of protection jurisdictions*” and “… *updated our foreign filing with this data, to help us spend money where it matters and where we get value for it \(i.e. worth filing a patent\)*” \(5.2\). Similarly, the IP Manager of an Israeli biotechnology firm explained how he used PEI to change their process and patent registration behaviour by deciding to cease their patenting activities in two countries \(Turkey and Romania\)\(5.3\). 

 Furthermore, the IP manager of a UK energy company acknowledges that the PEI informs their decision\-making, and their company may, for example, “ *reconsider filing in South Korea*” due to its unexpectedly low SPE strength \(5.4\). The IP Councillor of a US manufacturer used PEI to identify low scoring countries \(5.5\):“… *the research helps me specifically regarding countries with lower strength of IP protection…I would budget less resources to register IP in these countries, and…be more cautious of the risk of IP theft*…”. The Patent director of a Belgian pharmaceutical company with 2000\+ patents also finds that PEI \(5.6\): “… *helps in the decision\-making process to enforce a patent against an alleged infringer in a particular country*”. 

###  4.2 Commercial and educational practices of external patent attorneys 

 Patent attorneys practising in professional service firms also use PEI, to educate and advise clients, commonly SMEs with small patent portfolios, about registering \(or not\) patents in specific countries. 16 external patent attorneys from 10 countries adopted PEI as best practice in understanding global patent enforcement and changed their commercial promotion and educational practices when advising their clients. 

 For example, a Dutch external patent attorney company who integrated PEI in their customer guides, advising their clients about anticipating “ *the resources that may be required in each country if a patent is enforced*” \(5.7, p.8\). The patent attorney explains: “… *I have updated it \[*the guide *\]… using various resources, including your* \[PEI index *\]. It \[*PEI *\] nicely complements the rest of the information about costs*”. An Australian patent attorney firm used PEI in commercial presentations to educate and convince foreign companies to patent in Australia: “S *ince Australia falls into the top category* \[of PEI\] *this was a good reason to file in Australia…it is good for us if we can promote Australia as a place to do business and your chart assists us with that*” \(5.8\). 

###  4.3 Understanding and practice of patent policymakers and policy analysts 

 Patent policymakers and analysts use PEI to evaluate the performance of their national patent system, design policies to improve it and promote its attributes to foreign investors. Policy makers from five countries used PEI and its methodology to evaluate and analyze their countries’ enforcement effectiveness. A Senior Advisor from a U.S. Government Commission that experimentally uses “… *the index in our statutory reports and non\-statutory research projects*…” highlights: “ *we have a growing research interest in better understanding and quantifying the importance of the enforcement of intellectual property laws. This research provides a robust and transparent method for doing so for patent enforcement. It represents a major step forward in the literature*” \(5.9\). 

 Similarly, the Australian Productivity Commission incorporated PEI in their practice \(5.10, pp.100 & 211\), to evaluate the “ *enforcement practices and the administrative functioning of national patent systems as perceived by managers*"". PEI is the only index used in the report to measure patent enforcement. The Commission found that: “ *by international standards, Australia has adopted strong IP settings…beyond the point where it promotes significant increases in technology transfer*” and recommends “… *protection above minimum international standards does not benefit our exporters without reciprocal protection in our trading partners*” \(5.10, p.99\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The *Liveable Cities* research programme has resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between wellbeing and the urban environment. With new methods of designing and engineering low\-carbon, resource\-secure, wellbeing enhanced UK cities, the research has impacted upon the way policy makers think about and act upon the future of cities locally and nationally, specifically how they address the design of future cities in relation to improvements in the health, wellbeing and prosperity of the public over the long term. 

 The research has guided the way that: i\) the Government Office for Science \(GO\-Science\) thought about future cities and health in the UK; ii\) official regulatory documents are managed, in response to the Grenfell Inquiry; iii\) City Councils in the UK undertake strategic city planning, and in particular Lancaster City Council; and iv\) how the Connected Places Catapult approached business development and strategy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 For the past 10 years there has been a recognition amongst research funders, leading academics and latterly GO\-Science \(2013\) that research on cities had been too single discipline and silo focussed, and agreement that there was a need for more interdisciplinary futures\-focussed evidence to solve the problems facing cities. 

 The research led by Cooper and Dunn, and delivered by a team including Boyko, Pollastri, and Cureton, has focused on cities from a design\-led perspective, with three aims: 

 \(i\) to combine knowledge from science, social science and the humanities related to designing cities for improved human health and wellbeing; 

 \(ii\) to challenge existing assumptions about these issues, such as the best type of housing density, and allocation of green space; 

 \(iii\) to provide new evidence\-based insights to aid urban decision\-makers in addressing health, wellbeing and prosperity, such as planning that focuses on both density and intensity, including approaches to the night\-time economy that address health and wellbeing. 

 The research relates specifically to the *Liveable Cities* research programme, a GBP6.3million EPSRC initiative involving Birmingham University, Southampton University, UCL and Lancaster University, undertaken between 2013 and 2016 \[G1\]. *Liveable Cities* was an interdisciplinary programme involving engineers, architects, social scientists and scientists. Cooper and Dunn led research on future visions for cities, wellbeing in cities and how these issues relate to the design of cities. Our research consisted of: a\) a detailed historical analysis of visual material predicting the future of cities performance; b\) qualitative data collection on density, mobility, and socio\-economic aspects of neighbourhoods in Lancaster, Birmingham and Southampton; and c\) analysing complex data in science and social science to identify the underpinning factors affecting the design of cities, such as the relationship between environmental design and wellbeing; the night\-time economy and urban design; and the role of visions \(narrative or visual\) in decision\-making for cities. 

 The wellbeing and health analysis of this programme created an evidential base which revealed the relationship between the physical environment and mental and physical health, and the importance of this relationship in urban design, planning and policy making. From this came a series of specific design interventions capable of enhancing the physical, ambient and psychological environment to ensure that it is walkable, green, clean and safe, as well as nuanced design interventions for buildings in relation to health and wellbeing \[R1, R3, R6\]. 

 Research and visualisation of future cities involved engagement with industry, including retail companies such as Waitrose and utility companies such as Aecom; the heritage sector, such as National Trust and English Heritage; and local government, such as Lancashire County Council and Lancaster City Council. From this engagement came new narrative and visualisation tools, created between 2013 and 2015, capable of communicating the complex interdependencies of, and multiple perspectives on, specific city issues and futures \[R4\]. This work led to the UK’s GO\-Science Foresight Programme commissioning the researchers to undertake a further study, specifically with regard to its *Future of Cities* project \(2013 to 2016\). The team examined the opportunities and challenges facing UK cities over the next 50 years, specifically those related to science and innovation policy from a perspective of how future cities are visualised \[R2, R5\]. 

 The body of work has resulted in new recommendations for policy makers, professionals and the public on the role of design in built and urban futures. In summary, these are: a\) what design and planning decisions should include to enhance health and wellbeing in places; and b\) how best to use design and visualisation to communicate and understand complex information about the built environment, urban systems and urban futures, to ensure the creation of future liveable cities for wellbeing \[R4\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The sustained body of research undertaken by Cooper, Dunn and the research team has contributed to: 

1.  guiding national policy makers’ approach to planning, and further enabling 19 cities across the UK to undertake their own fore\-sighting activities through having the confidence to think and plan for the long term. 

1.  redesigning and redeveloping official regulatory documents and systems, in response to the Grenfell Inquiry. 

1.  shaping local government thinking around strategic city planning and wellbeing. 

1.  steering the strategic direction of organisations in terms of future planning, mobilities and health and wellbeing; from the Connected Places Catapult to small and medium\-sized enterprises \(SMEs\). 

 **1\) Guiding national policy makers’ approach to planning** 

 Cooper, with support from Dunn, had a ‘crucial’ role as a member of the Lead Expert Group \(LEG\) in the GO\-Science Foresight project *Future of Cities* \(FFC\) between 2013 and 2016 \[S1\]. Commissioned by the government’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Foresight projects have been running for 25 years; they focus on government imperatives, particularly long\-term trends, challenges and implications for policy. The FFC project was championed by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Greg Clarke MP. Cooper was chosen to be part of the LEG due not only to her expertise in design, urban design and wellbeing, but also her previous extensive experience with other Foresight programme projects. The Lead Foresight manager said, “ *Rachel’s expertise in the fields of health, wellbeing, and urban design, alongside her wealth of experience in contributing to, and leading on, government funded projects \(including an earlier Foresight project\), meant she was an obvious choice for inclusion on the LEG. Rachel’s role was really critical because she was one of the few people who…had a really good idea of the end result of the project should look like for best impact* ” \[S1\]. Chairman of the LEG added that where most researchers only carry out analysis, “ *Rachel’s other key contribution to help the project was in inventing possible futures and it was incredibly important to have her on the group…she helped us to design scenarios and alternative plans and policies that would underpin different scenarios*” \[S2\]. 

 Both sources further commended Cooper’s research, strategically utilised in the design of the highly successful Fore\-sighting Manual \(2016\). The Manual has been used extensively by city and county councils and local authorities: “ *being an expert in communication and event design \(she\) was also being called upon to help us design workshops and materials for workshops and communicating on complex ‘city futures’ issues  and between academics and policy makers and government*” \[S1\]. Engaging research users with the work in this way has impacted upon 19 different cities across the UK, e.g., Milton Keynes, Rochdale, Newcastle, Manchester, Reading and Belfast, who used it to develop their own Foresight projects and, in some cases, went on to develop their own 50 year future visions. Milton Keynes is a notable, highly successful example of this process, with its City Council unanimously accepting the recommendations of the *MK Futures 2050 Commission* in 2017 \[S3\]. Newcastle also developed its own *City Futures Development Group*, comprising local authorities, universities, the Local Enterprise Partnership and the private sector, to develop a long\-term plan for the city’s development and research needs, with support provided by Foresight’s *Future of Cities* project \[S4\]. The manual was influenced by the creation of a *City Visions Network* \(2013\) across the UK and developed and used in workshops led by Cooper and Dunn. The approach developed from a local to a regional initiative, and then grew into a national network, feeding into Foresight work in helping people to develop future visions, with a particular emphasis on second and third tier urban centres. For example, Dunn’s leadership of the *Future of Rochdale* project was a precursor to the levelling up agenda and subsequent initiative *Stronger Towns Fund*, through which Rochdale received GBP173,029. 

 Building on the *City Visions Network*, another continuing benefit of enabling cities to think about and envision long\-term futures was the creation of the Urban Insights Group, a collaboration between Lancaster City Council and Cooper and Dunn in 2016. The Lead Planner at Lancaster City Council said that adopting this approach, “ *had given the council team confidence in our work and our long term vision and to think beyond the immediate issues and politics”* \[S8\]. 

 **2\) Redesigning and redeveloping official regulatory documents and systems, in response to the Grenfell Inquiry** 

 In the wake of the Grenfell tragedy, the UK Government’s  [*Independent Review of Building Regulations and Fire Safety*](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/707785/Building_a_Safer_Future_-_web.pdf) \(2018, led by Dame Judith Hackitt\) labelled the regulatory system covering high\-rise and complex buildings as ‘not fit for purpose’ and having ‘deep flaws’. This included the suite of Building Regulation Approved Documents used by many thousands of builders, building inspectors, construction companies and architects across the UK. As a result, the Buildings and Regulations Advisory Committee \(BRAC\) commissioned an expert group and tasked them with making recommendations to improve these Documents. Drawing on the research and her team’s expertise on the design, construction and planning of cities, and the visualisation of complex issues in cities \[R1\], between January and June 2019, Cooper made a major contribution to the group’s report, as one of only two members with no background in the construction industry. As the Secretary to BRAC stated: “ *her background in design would also allow her to look at the overall suite of documents, and help design the most effective approach to answer the challenges raised by Grenfell, and to ask the difficult questions, i.e. why do you do it this way and what does it mean to be user friendly?...* *It was a hugely successful group who wrote a hugely successful report that Dame Judith Hackitt was delighted with. She was very, very positive about the report*” \[S5\]. Due to delays caused by the 2019 general election and coronavirus pandemic, the report has yet to be published. 

 The Secretary stated that recommendations in the report \- to reorganise, streamline and digitise the Approved Documents \- will “ *make people’s lives easier… it will have significant long\-term benefits for the construction sector, making it easier for builders, construction firms, architects and building inspectors to meet and adjudge the new standards, but also by extension the general public, as it will ensure safer buildings for us to live and work in*”. Speaking to broader significance, the Secretary also offered: “ *At a policy decision\-making level, the report and Rachel’s insights on digital design and accessibility have given the Ministry for Housing and Local Governments food for thought about <ins></ins>what is specifically achievable from a regulatory reform and communication perspective, and what we really need to prioritise in the rolling out of such major changes. It has triggered a lot of reconsideration in how we can do things in the future and bring them more into the digital age, but also then keep them in the digital age and not slip back into old habits. Digital design can help make regulations and policy more accessible and this has been a critical learning from our work with Rachel*” \[S5\]. 

 **3\) Shaping local government thinking around strategic city planning and wellbeing** 

 Dunn, Cooper, Pollastri and Cureton drew on their insights into wellbeing and place making \[R1\-6\] when building capacity amongst Lancaster City Council city planning team, between 2013 and 2017. Through workshops designed to involve participants in the research process, the city planners and the research team co\-created and developed understanding and knowledge of the complexity of city design, place making, transport systems and wellbeing. The Lead Planner at Lancaster City Council said of the interaction: “ *The workshops explored issues relating to transport, infrastructure and sustainability, but also explored ideas around health, wellbeing and liveable places. These engagements have continued over the past years since our first meeting, and they have provided substantial benefits to both the City and \[Lancashire\] County Councils and helped influence the direction of both authority’s programmes in these areas*” \[S8\]. More recently another series of workshops, led by Dunn and Cooper, has further influenced the development and testing of a collaborative initiative between Lancaster City Council and Lancashire County Council \(the higher tiered local government body\). The Councils’ plan to realise a vision for Lancaster city centre’s future development is laid out in  [*Lancaster City Centre Movement and Public Realm Strategy*](https://lancashire.gov.uk/media/920691/2517-id-001-08-movement-strategy_compressed.pdf) and is described by the Lead Planner as a ‘once in a generation opportunity’. He stated the research\-informed workshops had “ *helped inform the work that the City Council is currently undertaking regarding planning for post\-Covid recovery, as we seek to reinvent the function and purpose of our established town centre*” \[S8\] *.* 

 Moreover, Cooper’s relationship with Lancaster City Council has helped to shape its strategy and overall outlook, and relationship with Lancashire County Council: “ *Rachel’s research insights in health, wellbeing and place making has helped inform, but also gives us confidence to be able to take forward our own thoughts as well because we share the ambition for the city with Rachel and her team and we want to see it fulfil its full potential… not just in terms of a physical concept, but what it means in terms of the wellbeing of the population, it’s helped us move the debate forward and shape it with \[Lancashire\] County Council as well*” \[S6\]. 

 **4\) Steering the strategic direction of organisations, in terms of future planning, mobilities and health and wellbeing; from the Connected Places Catapult to SMEs** 

 Cooper was a non\-executive director of the Future Cities Catapult \(FCC\), now the Connected Places Catapult \(a merger of FCC and the Transport Systems Catapult in 2019\) between 2013 and 2020. Catapults are not\-for\-profit organisations backed by Innovate UK to translate research and knowledge into commercial opportunities for the benefit of UK industry. The *Liveable Cities* project and all the 14 corresponding *little Books* \(edited and produced at Lancaster\) relating the findings were distributed and communicated at a workshop with the Catapult team in 2016. The Chief Executive of the Connected Places Catapult said *“of particular importance have been the little Books of Liveable Cities … incredibly valuable, offering digestible insights into the latest thinking on urban and digital design and have influenced how we approach the future of places.”*  Furthermore, Cooper’s research insights from *Liveable Cities* project have meant that “ *she has played a critical role in the governance of \[Catapult’s\] success*”. The Chief Executive added, “ *In 2017, we had a big policy debate, as part of the review process that Rachel was overseeing. It centred on the important question: are we here to make cities better, or are we here to grow UK PLC? … Not everyone on the board got this nuance. Rachel’s contribution ... ensured this was correctly communicated, and her role in developing strategies around these related issues has had a major impact on the policies and steer of the organisation. She sat on every strategy sub\-committee, to rewrite the strategy. Her contribution and insight there was invaluable*” \[S6\]. 

 The Chief Executive and the Policy Lead at Connected Places Catapult also alluded to Cooper’s research insights having influenced the Catapult’s direction and focus on the future of planning, mobilities and health and wellbeing \[S6, S7\]. The former said, “ *expertise in digital design, was also critical in terms of our approach to land use, planning and city design. As a direct consequence of her intervention, the organisation now increasingly looks at this in terms of digital planning and design of the built environment. Two principles that come directly out of Rachel’s research insights. These approaches have been further entrenched through her role in informing various iterations of our strategy* <ins>\(https://cp.catapult.org.uk/about\-us/our\-mission\-and\-ro</ins><ins>le/\)</ins>”. Consequently, FCC has made an impact on the digital land and planning landscape by supporting research and innovation to change regulations and by digitising the system with the support of over 200 SMEs working in this area. It has also impacted upon the development of internal skills and the capacity of the Catapult with regard to local government strategy and planning. The Policy Lead said, “ *There are many companies now developing products and services in this space, there’s about 100 local authorities are benefiting from the work…The ministry of housing now have 30 people on it working around changing urban design and planning the regulations in line with the principles of FCC and by extension, Rachel*” \[S7\]. 

 As a member of the FCC board, Cooper’s contribution to strategy and governance saw the FCC successfully merge with the Transport Catapult to form the Connected Places Catapult in 2019, with a place centred vision and strategy that meant it was funded by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \(BEIS\) to 100% of the original funding for both of the original two catapults. This level of funding allows the successful work of both catapults to continue for the next 4 years.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Our work on understanding/overcoming educational disadvantage has made a difference to assessing disadvantaged school intakes, and attainment, for policy\-makers, pressure groups, schools and individuals. Our work is a key go\-to source for politicians/organisations debating policies on educational disadvantage. This widespread engagement has then been a factor in policy and practice decisions. We have helped individuals and schools defend themselves, creating a fairer education system. Policy\-makers have halted plans for Forced Academisation, plans for widespread grammar school expansion have not materialised, and the Social Mobility Commission and others have defended schools and pupils in the North East, all in line with our findings addressing the education of disadvantaged pupils. Over 1,400 UK schools now use and cite our research directly in helping them decide how best to address the disadvantage gap. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Our work on educational disadvantage has been widely taken up by governments, practitioner bodies, and school stakeholders, and our evidence has been deployed by schools to help reduce the poverty attainment gap. We are concerned with the secure identification of the most disadvantaged students in schools in England, how targeted funding is best spent by schools on improvements for these disadvantaged students in the Pupil Premium era, and how these issues are linked with concurrent policies on school diversification, and regional differences in attainment. We look at where disadvantaged students are being educated, and how best to improve their education, qualifications and subsequent participation. This led us to re\-consider policy claims that disadvantaged students were doing especially well/badly in some areas or types of schools. 

 We monitored between\-school segregation over time \[R2, Section B3\], and looked at the impact of new kinds of schools, like Academies. The 2010 Coalition government moved to increase the number of academies in England, perhaps making all schools into academies. Using national school data, we showed that academies were linked to higher social segregation of pupils between schools, with no clear gain in attainment \[R1\]. We looked at the planned expansion of older school types like selective grammars \[R4\]. In the 2017 UK election, there were manifesto proposals from the Conservative Party to expand the number of places at grammar schools, and the number of such schools, in England. In 2017, we published an early view open access article based on re\-analysis of the National Pupil Database, showing no clear benefits from a grammar school system \[R4\], which had immediate wide readership <ins>beyond academia</ins> <ins>with</ins> 21,942 downloads, the most read piece in all 40 years of the British Journal of Sociology of Education. The results were immediately taken up by a variety of relevant stakeholders to argue against expansion. We re\-examined regional disparities such as the purported underachievement of schools in North East England \[R5\]. We developed more targeted ways of assessing disadvantage using the idea of a ‘trajectory’ of individual indicators evidenced from administrative data, considering how long each pupil has been labelled as disadvantaged, at any point in their school career \[R6\]. This has helped stakeholders to defend the performance of schools and teachers in the North, and to petition for greater resources to deal with the higher proportion of long\-term disadvantage there. These improved measures have shown that the relative ‘failure’ of schools in the NE is an illusion, and that increasing diversity of and selection to schools has no clear benefit. It is dangerous for social equality. The work has promoted better understanding of all these issues, and so defends the schooling of disadvantaged students, and identifies improvements to help make better policy for the future. 

 Using randomised trials, we evaluated school interventions intended to improve outcomes for disadvantaged learners \[R3\]. Of these several have been listed by the Education Endowment Foundation \(EEF\) and others as “promising”, including Accelerated Reader, Switch\-On Reading, Philosophy for Children, and Children’s University. Over 1,000 UK schools are now using these interventions and citing our evaluations on their websites as their reason for spending Catch\-up/Pupil Premium funding on the chosen interventions, and are reporting successes for disadvantaged pupils.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Our model of ‘trajectories’ of disadvantage \[R6\] is used to consider the allocation and impact of the Pupil Premium \[R5\], the context for school performance measures \[R1, R4\], regional disparities in education, and measuring segregation \[R2\]. It has been widely taken up and espoused by governments \[R5\], practitioner bodies, and school stakeholders. Our findings have been linked to specific policy issues such as the withdrawal of a Bill to force all schools in England to become Academies, and affected public policy discourse on disadvantage in schools, including in relation to the expansion of grammar schools, and the North:South divide in education. Our research on reducing the poverty attainment gap \[R3\] has directly influenced the work of many schools and education providers in England. All of this impact is intended to promote better policy, funding and practice decisions that will reduce the impact of educational disadvantage. 

 **Defending disadvantaged schools against forced Academisation:** The proposed ‘Forced Conversion of Schools to Academies’ was opposed by an NUT newsletter to all 330,000\+ members, and picked up by activists across England, saying “ Academies are creating greater segregation between pupils from rich and poor homes than community schools, according to research, led by Professor Stephen Gorard from the University of Durham” \[E1.1\]. R1 was reported in EDUFACTS \(2014\) “Analysis by Professor Stephen Gorard found no clear evidence that academies outperformed the schools which they replaced or similar local authority schools with equivalent intakes. He also found no evidence of any benefit for schools which are already performing well converting to academies” \[E1.2\]. A TUC briefing cited R2 saying “Gorard and his collaborators are amongst the foremost researchers of school segregation. They have used a national pupil database with data from 1989 onwards covering all state\-funded primary and secondary schools in England… There was an even greater link between higher segregation and a higher proportion of converter academies” \[E1.3\]. These widely\-read union briefings also led to greater awareness of our evidence among Parliamentarians. 

 This was illustrated in the Education and Adoption Bill 8<sup>th</sup> Sitting. For example, Kevin Brennan MP, the Shadow Minister for Education said, “Professor Stephen Gorard of Durham University pointed out in his written evidence that we should be very careful about that fragmentation and ensure it does not cause socioeconomic divides and issues around special needs, which we spoke about earlier. On that basis, I ask my hon. Friends to join me in opposing clause 7 \[forced academisation\] stand part” \[E1.4\]. This debate cites evidence submitted by us based on R1 \[E1.5\], and Brennan again referred to this evidence when discussing coasting schools, in Clause 1 of the Education and Adoption Bill 9<sup>th</sup> Sitting \[E1.5\]. Following pressure from opposition and activists like the TUC and NUT who all quoted our work as the underpinning evidence, the government reversed the announcement that all schools in England would become academies. 

 Our evidence was used in more direct local campaigning against forced Academisation, such as opposition to the Sedgehill and Prendergast Academy 2015 plans: “Converter Academies, on average, take far less than their fair share of disadvantaged pupils. They aren’t helping increase social justice in education… \[according to\] Professor Gorard, listed in Governors’ own report” \[E1.6\]. The Socialist Party \(formerly Militant\) picked up this campaign, using the same evidence in ‘Save our schools’ \[E1.7\]. Sedgehill and Prendergast have not been forced to become Academies. 

 **Defending the integration of disadvantaged pupils against grammar school expansion:** In the build\-up to the 2017 election, grammar school expansion was opposed by political and pressure groups, such as Liberal Democrat Voice and Left Futures, using our evidence R4 and R6 \[E2.1\-2.2\]. Our work forms a substantial part of two Full Fact reports on the evidence surrounding grammar schools/social mobility \[E2.3\-2.4\], in the Houses of Parliament POST Note for MPs/Lords on ‘Academic Evidence on Selective Secondary Education’ \[E2.5\], and is the basis for opposition to grammar schools by the pressure group Comprehensive Future, based on R2 and R4 \[E2.6\]. The Labour Party Manifesto for the 2017 General Election had a supporting document ‘Ending Selection by wealth, ability and aptitude. “Take for example, the very thorough recent study of 500,000 children by Gorard and Siddiqui from the University of Durham that shows that when adjusted for background and prior attainment, grammar school pupils achieve near identical results to similar pupils in comprehensive schools. Supporters of selection have argued that disadvantaged children do better in selective than non\-selective schools but Gorard and Siddiqui show this is simply not the case” \[E2.7\]. 

 The same research was referenced several times in Parliament in both houses. In a debate on ‘Social Mobility and Economy’, Lynn Brown MP Shadow Minister Treasury said “Many of us will have seen the new research from Durham University confirming that grammar school pupils do better because they are more likely to have social advantages, not because selective education is superior...” \[E2.8\]. The same study was referred to by Lord Storey, Liberal Democrat Lords Spokesperson on Education, in a debate on ‘Schools that Work for Everyone’, when he answered, “Why are we opposed to grammar schools?” \[E2.9\]. 

 Commenting on a Radio 4 Tonight \(2018\) broadcast, the Local Schools Network said “Plainly, as this research by Stephen Gorard establishes, the idea that selective grammar schools or academies are more likely to improve pupil progress overall than community comprehensives, is demolished” \[E2.10\]. Education Politics reported the 2018 Caroline Benn Memorial Lecture in the House of Commons “was delivered by Professor Stephen Gorard from Durham University. The lecture was a masterclass in showing how a rigorous analysis of data can challenge the ill\-informed assumptions of many policy makers. A central claim was that data relating to poverty has been consistently misunderstood and that this has led policy makers to draw radically wrong conclusions… Pupil Premium allocations and much of the analysis of disadvantage that follows from it miss the essential difference between brief periods of low income and chronic, endemic levels of poverty found in some areas. This means of course that we are distributing funding in a way that doesn’t properly match needs” \[E2.11\]. The messages from our research have clearly been heard and taken on board by many of those concerned. The 2017 election did not produce an outright majority for the Conservatives, the chief adviser to the PM changed immediately after the election, and in 2019 the PM herself resigned. The grammar school policy is currently in abeyance. 

 Our work was used more directly at local levels. The Kent Education Network opposed plans for a new satellite grammar school. “Having viewed proposals by Queen Elizabeth Grammar School and the Barton Court Academy Trust I, on behalf of the Governors of The Whitstable School, would like to express unequivocal objection to what those plans appear to envisage… the notion that grammar schools promote social mobility is routinely claimed. That claim has been investigated most recently by Professor Stephen Gorard of the University of Durham. The Gorard study has received a lot of attention… with an irreproachably inclusive sample i.e. the entire national KS4 population 2014– 2016… There is absolutely *no empirical evidence* that grammar schools have made **any** positive impact on social mobility” \[E2.12\]. This new satellite school has not been agreed. Our study has been used as evidence by a parent arguing for the release of age 11\+ data, in a Freedom of Information Administrative Appeals Tribunal \[E2.13\]. 

####  Refocussing attention away from purported school failure in the North:South divide \[Evidence E3\] 

 The image of failing schools in the NE does not stand up to robust scrutiny \[R5, R6\]. The National Governance Association referred to R6 in a report querying the official idea that schools in the North of England were failing their poorer pupils \[E3.1\]. A manifesto for a disadvantaged authority in the northeast reported in the New Statesman, ‘Searching for the Hartlepool Promise’ said “This isn’t a north\-south divide, either, as some would have it. Professor Stephen Gorard of Durham University tracked the progress of 1.8 million pupils. He found no evidence that schools in the northeast were less effective. It is the socio\-economic mix of a pupil body that dictates outcomes, not school effectiveness” \[E3.2\]. The Head of Policy at the Social Mobility Commission asked for our help on this when preparing its 2018 State of the Nation Report, which recommended that government consider whether “differential levels of funding might be more beneficial for those with long\-term disadvantage”, as we had suggested \[E3.3\]. Sammy Wright, a Social Mobility Commissioner, wrote to us because our work came up in conversations with Opportunity North East and Schools North East, asking for help to “address the problems of social mobility with an awareness of the subtleties of the data” \[E3.4\]. This led to a roundtable to “explore likely solutions with the hope of establishing a set of medium\-term social mobility principles \[E3.5\]. Following this, the press quoted Commissioner Sammy Wright as saying that “schools should receive more cash for pupils who have been on free school meals longer”, using our figures in R5 in support \[E3.6\]. 

 In response to claims that children in disadvantaged parts of the North are 18 months behind their peers elsewhere, and the blame that this implied for schools and teachers, a Schools North East blog said “Durham University’s Professor Stephen Gorard, shows that once you account for the impact of long\-term deprivation, the region’s secondaries perform as well as any in the country” \[E3.7\]. And responding to DfE funding figures “Despite the high levels of long\-term disadvantage in our region, we will not be receiving adequate funding” \[E3.8\]. Our findings were used in the Schools North East election manifesto for NE education \[E3.9\-3.10\]. In January 2020, Ofsted identified schools described as “stuck” and claimed that these were disproportionately in the northeast, particularly Darlington. Schools North East and others were able to use our re\-analysis in R6 to show that these claims were false \[E3.11\]. A different kind of school improvement is needed. 

 We have been contacted by individuals/groups of schools, to discuss our research in their contexts. Sarah Holmes\-Carne, Head of Kenton School wrote wanting us to “analyse how Kenton FSM6 do against National FSM6 in terms of progress... based on the number of years claiming”, in order to select appropriate strategies \[E3.12\]. We showed that pupils at Kenton were making equivalent progress to all pupils in England who had been Free School Meal \(FSM\)\-eligible for the same duration. We helped Andy Finley, Headteacher of Park View School in Chester\-le\-Street \[E3.13\], and Amy Blackburn, Pupil Premium lead of Oxbridge Lane School in Stockton \[E3.14\], with talks to staff, advice and re\-analyses of their data. These schools now target interventions at persistently disadvantaged pupils. 

 **Reducing the attainment gap by improving school outcomes for disadvantaged pupils:** The Teaching Schools Council used evidence based on our large systematic review of how to improve primary education, funded by the DfE, and also cited our EEF evaluation report on enhanced feedback \[E4.1\]. The DfE \(2018\) published guidance for schools on how to spend the catch\-up funding for literacy/numeracy which references six of our evaluations in R3 \[E4.2\]. An EEF \(2019\) list of “promising projects” contains four of our evaluations \[E4.3\]. Both reports are widely cited by schools on their own websites. Across England, a further 1,409 schools have been found with a direct reference to our work on their websites, explaining that our evidence is why they have spent their catch\-up/Pupil Premium funding on one of the programmes we evaluated in R3 – e.g. Accelerated Reader, Switch\-On Reading, and Philosophy for Children – and suggesting that using this evidence has helped their pupils, especially the lowest attaining/most disadvantaged \[E4.4\]. 

 For example, Hayle Academy website says, “according to an independent study by… Durham University, Accelerated Reader produces ‘particularly positive results’... I am pleased to say the following students have... received their certificates for reading over a million words since September” \[E4.5\]. Prescot Primary School says “\[Evidence\] taken from the EEF evaluation report 2015... The Accelerate Reader programme has been met with a positive response from teachers and children alike... Children... can talk confidently about the books they have read” \[E4.6\]. Bellingham Middle School cited our EEF research in using Accelerated Reader, reporting a rise in Pupil Premium pupils reaching expected reading levels from 20% December 2018 to 80% March 2019 \[E4.7\]. Programme developers have also seen an impact. The national charity developing Philosophy for Children \(P4C\) in schools reported a huge increase in the number of schools applying for their training following publication of our evaluation in 2015. Bob House \(CEO SAPERE\) sent us a graph showing a trebling of school registrations for P4C, and a letter summarising an upturn in both national and international interest in training for P4C \[E4.8\]. He said “Durham University Evidence Centre for Education findings for the Education Endowment Foundation study into Philosophy for Children, published July 2015, had a substantial impact on the uptake of the programme”. 

 Based on our publications/presentations R1–R6, we wrote more than 40 articles for practice/professional magazines including New Scientist, Significance, and Research Fortnight. We were invited to present to policymakers, practitioners, and general public on over 70 occasions, including Labour Party Conference, ResearchEd, Demos, and regional head teacher conferences. Press coverage of our work includes at least 170 stories in all major newspapers including Guardian, Economist, Sun, Independent, TES, Observer, New Statesman, THE, i, Daily Mirror, Sunday Times, Financial Times, Telegraph, Daily Mail, Times, Evening Standard, and Metro. Almost every local newspaper in England covered our story about the impact of grammar schools. Stories about our research appeared on Sky, BBC and ITV national news, Sunday Politics, Victoria Derbyshire and Breakfast on BBC1, Radio 2, Radio 4, Five Live, and LBC, with the grammar school story being covered by most UK local radio stations \[examples E2.11, E2.13, E3.11\]. We were recognised in the 2018 BERA Impact and Engagement Awards. We provided oral evidence to the House of Commons Education Committee, which also published our further written evidence, as part of 8 other investigations. We provided oral evidence to the EU Commission, Royal Society of Edinburgh, and written evidence to the Scottish Parliament Education and Skills Committee, on the attainment of pupils experiencing poverty. We were invited by the Director General for Social Care, Mobility and Disadvantage at the DfE to discuss our findings on the North:South divide to all staff across England at ‘DfE Live’ \(19 November 2019\). We acted as academic adviser to the Cabinet Office from 2014. We took part in Evidence Week in Parliament 2019, speaking to 39 Parliamentarians including Shadow Minister for Education. On the basis of work described in this case study, all three authors accepted invitations to join the Cabinet Office “What Works Advice Panel” for civil servants as part of the Prime Minister’s Implementation Unit.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Todd’s research has inspired both professional and amateur theatre groups and writers to perform and reinterpret the work of Shelagh Delaney – a working\-class playwright \(1938\-2012\) – in ways that attracted new audiences. Most specifically, theatre directors and writers have used Todd’s research to develop their artistic practice by foregrounding women’s writing and experiences. Todd’s work has also helped to extend the reach of cultural organisations by encouraging women and young people in the Greater Manchester area to participate in the arts. In these ways, the research has increased public understanding of Delaney’s work and of working\-class culture.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research underpinning this case study was undertaken in three related projects on which Todd was Principal Investigator: G1: ‘A biographical study of Shelagh Delaney’ \(Arts Council funded, 2014\-15\), G2: ‘Feminism, culture and women’s lives in Britain c.1945\-c.2015’ \(AHRC funded, 2017\-18\), and G3: ‘Housing, culture and women’s citizenship in Britain c.1945 to the present’ \(AHRC funded, 2018\-19\). 

 G1 examined the life and work of Shelagh Delaney \(1938\-2012\) using unpublished papers and interviews with Delaney’s family and friends. G2 and G3 analysed how Delaney’s working\-class background informed her work, and examined its relevance for young people and women in 21<sup>st</sup> century Salford \(Delaney’s home town, and an area of high socio\-economic deprivation\). G2 and G3 also disseminated Delaney’s work to audiences in north\-west England. 

 Todd’s research uncovered aspects of Delaney’s life, and several of her works, that had previously been overlooked by scholars and cultural practitioners. Delaney was a teenager when her debut play, *A Taste of Honey*, had its premiere in 1958. *Honey* was a box\-office hit and adapted into a film in 1961; it has been staged around the world and is on GCSE English and Drama syllabuses. *Honey* centres on Jo, a white, working\-class teenager who gets pregnant while having a brief relationship with a black sailor. Many productions, along with most of the limited scholarship on Delaney, have been overly influenced by the approaches of *Honey*’s first director, Joan Littlewood, and of Tony Richardson, who directed the film adaptation. Littlewood emphasised the brutality of working\-class life \(through casual racism and homophobia\), while Richardson foregrounded heterosexual romance. In contrast, Delaney’s original script focused on the complex relationship between Jo and her single mother, Helen. 

 Scholars and practitioners have also wrongly assumed that Littlewood was solely responsible for the avant\-garde aspects of *Honey,* such as the use of live music and breaking of the fourth wall. Todd’s research showed that these innovations resulted from collaboration with Delaney, whose attempt to capture women’s dreams and frustrations drew on music hall, Samuel Beckett and cinema. The tendency of scholars and directors to categorise Delaney as a social realist has overlooked her interest in exploring emotion and desire in women’s lives. 

  

 Delaney’s later work similarly foregrounded working\-class women’s lives and voices. While many commentators assume she stopped writing after *Honey*, Todd’s research revealed that she enjoyed a long career as a writer for theatre, film and television. Her work showcased the richness of women’s voices and illuminated aspects of their lives – including mother/daughter relationships and female friendship in older age – that remains neglected in the media and the arts today. 

 Todd developed these conclusions in her book *Tastes of Honey: The Making of Shelagh Delaney and a Cultural Revolution*.\[R1\] Todd’s key research findings informed the collaborations and inspired the new cultural work described in Section 4: 

-  Delaney’s work developed from and contributed to a rich community culture, and subsequent generations have found the work captivating. Todd’s research challenges prevailing political rhetoric and cultural policies that treat such communities as ‘marginal’ to cultural life, or as lacking ‘cultural capital’. 

-  Delaney’s career was facilitated by radical and socialist theatre and by the welfare state, and her work needs to be understood in relation to an ongoing tradition of innovative local arts initiatives, often run as grass\-roots enterprises. Greater opportunities to meet the existing demand within local communities are vital to sustain levels of aspiration and cultural engagement, contrary to some current media and political assertions.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Todd’s research **increased cultural participation in working\-class areas.** In 2016 Todd’s research inspired **MaD Theatre Company** – a community theatre based in north Manchester – to create a Delaney Theatre Group \(DTG\) in premises in Salford owned by the Guinness Partnership, an affordable housing provider. MaD’s Co\-Director notes that ‘thanks to Selina’s work, which demonstrated the importance of Shelagh Delaney’s work, the Guinness Partnership agreed to support us in establishing the Delaney Community Theatre Group’.\[E1, E2\] 

 Inspired by Todd’s research, and supported by her AHRC grants, the DTG staged an adaptation of a trilogy of Shelagh Delaney’s short stories, *Sweetly Sings the Donkey*, at The Lowry, Salford in September 2017 \(2 sell\-out performances; total audience 240\). A BBC North West news report, broadcast in 2017, highlighted that the members of the DTG were ‘amateur actors who grew up on the same streets’ as Shelagh Delaney.\[E3\] The Co\-Director of MaD reports that participation developed members’ confidence, encouraged some to achieve professional qualifications and led others ‘to create their own plays that have been performed at Greater Manchester Fringe’.\[E1\] 

 Cultural organisations and practitioners were major beneficiaries of Todd’s research. Todd led two public workshops on her research at the Working Class Movement Library, Salford **.** The Library Manager states that these ‘drew in many local people who had not visited the Library before’, **increasing public engagement with the Library**.\[E4\] 

 The research **helped MaD to expand their cultural practice and network, with lasting benefits.** The company’s Co\-Director writes that their partnership with Todd was ‘a new and fruitful departure…as until then we had staged our own work’.\[E1\] The Lowry’s Senior Theatres Programmer and Producer notes that ‘Professor Todd’s work in raising the profile of the playwright to new local audiences’ helped persuade The Lowry to stage the DTG’s performances.\[E5\] The Co\-Director reports that ‘as a direct result of \[the project\], MaD was able to establish a much needed relationship with The Lowry’. This is ‘invaluable…as it introduces our work to new audiences from beyond the districts of Manchester where our participants live’.\[E1\] 

 The research partnership **enabled MaD and** **The Lowry to increase audience reach**. Lowry staff ‘were delighted with the response and \[the opportunity\] to engage so directly with people who were new to The Lowry and theatre generally’.\[E5\] 31% of the DTG’s audience had attended a theatre twice or less in the 12 months prior to the performance; 19% had not attended a theatre in this period.\[E6\] Todd’s research thus **enabled MaD to achieve its aim of ‘produc\[ing\] theatre by and for people who would not normally attend’**.\[E1\] 

 Todd’s research \(e.g. R1\) contributed to an increased affinity among the project partners with Delaney’s social themes. Through their production and performances, they renewed **public interest in Delaney’s work and challenged negative stereotypes of working\-class life.** The BBC North West report observed that ‘Salford born Shelagh Delaney became an overnight success with her ground\-breaking debut play’ and emphasised that DTG members came from ‘the same streets’. By 31 July 2020 this report had been viewed on Facebook approximately 37,000 times.\[E3\] Audience members at the DTG’s performances of *Sweetly Sings the Donkey* praised the positive portrayal of northern working\-class life: ‘very northern, very Salford\!’.\[E7.1\] The performances also enriched spectators’ understanding of Delaney’s work: ‘\[I have gained\] More understanding of her work and would like to now know more’;\[E7.2\] ‘\[I learned\] that she continued to write wonderful plays throughout her life. Now I want to see more’.\[E7.3\] 

 The research **encouraged practitioners and participants to represent and value working\-class women’s experiences**. Todd commissioned freelance writer **Charlotte Delaney** to adapt *Sweetly Sings the Donkey* for the DTG’s stage performances. This was Charlotte Delaney’s first stage adaptation, and success gave her ‘the confidence to take the rigour of academic research and apply it to the conversations, relationships and choices made by “everyday” women’ in her subsequent work.\[E8\] Charlotte Delaney led three creative writing workshops at a women’s refuge in Salford where, influenced by Todd’s research she encouraged ‘women to explore their own voices’. This helped some participants to become ‘more confident at speaking for themselves in difficult situations’.\[E8\] Todd’s work inspired MaD to include ‘\[Shelagh\] Delaney’s life and work in a commissioned production for the Co\-operative Group’ about Manchester, in order to show that ‘ordinary women played a huge part in the cultural heritage of Greater Manchester’.\[E1\] 

 Todd’s work was an **‘invaluable resource’ for the 2019\-20 National Theatre production of **A Taste of Honey**. It helped the director ‘understand…\[how\] some of Shelagh’s difficult early experiences were expressing themselves through the play’. Cast members read Todd’s *Tastes of Honey* so that ‘we were able to begin our rehearsal period with a shared in\-depth knowledge of the \[play’s\] background’.\[E9\] The director had previously directed a 2014 production of *Honey*, but Todd’s research changed his interpretation of the play. He and his team ‘developed one of the main ideas of this production – the relationship between the audience, the live music and the actors – through our conversations with Selina’.\[E9\] The resulting production had more than 80 sold\-out performances in ten venues, including The Lowry \(with combined Lowry audiences estimated at c.10,000\) **.** The *Guardian*’s reviewer noted that some productions of *Honey* ‘seem a little patronising, as if the 19\-year\-old Delaney merely had a certain authenticity to offer’, whereas the production by the National Theatre ‘isn’t particularly interested in being “real” and is all the more interesting for it’.\[E10\] Todd’s research thus **generated new ways of thinking about and understanding Delaney’s work.**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ash from volcanic eruptions disperses over vast areas, causing a major threat to aviation safety and extensive financial losses \(estimated GBP1,180,000,000 from the 2010 Eyafjalljӧkull eruption\). NASA, in conjunction with engine manufacturers, evaluated aircraft jet engine performance with Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research \(VIPR\) tests. Ash transport and deposition data, quantified from lake and peatland sediment cores across Europe, enabled NASA to verify ash particle size distributions for their VIPR\-III experiment \(2015\). Rolls\-Royce subsequently established ash cloud conditions that allow safe aircraft flight, allowing aircraft operators to change their risk assessments for low level ash clouds that would previously have been avoided entirely. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Volcanic eruptions emitting ash clouds pose significant hazards to jet aircraft. Historically \(e.g. during the 2010 Eyafjalljӧkull eruption in Iceland\), poor understanding of the way in which ash particles of different sizes and densities interacted with jet engines meant that avoiding ‘visible’ or ‘discernible’ ash was the only way to operate. Swindles, Watson and Lawson, along with collaborators from Florida, Poznan, Polish Academy of Sciences, Stockholm and Belfast carried out pioneering work from 2010 onwards, analysing sedimentary volcanic ash layers preserved in lake sediments and peatlands in combination with historically\-documented records of past volcanic ash fallout events **\[1\-4\]**. These studies provided unique records of past volcanic ash clouds across Europe, which enhanced understanding of particle size distributions at different distances from eruptions **\[e.g. 1, 4\]**. Work was funded by a grant from the Climate and Geohazards Service \(University of Leeds\) and a NERC doctoral studentship \(NE/K500847/1\) with CASE support from Willis Insurance. 

 Rock fragments and particles ejected by volcanoes disperse through the atmosphere, and eventually accumulate in soils and lake sediments. The nature of the particles \(shapes, size and geochemical composition\) was studied further with colleagues from Edinburgh, the Met Office and Reykjavík to enhance understanding of the source, and thus mapping of the types of volcanic ash that can be transported far away from volcanoes **\[5,6\]**. Our research analysed particle size distributions, geochemistry, and glass shard morphology of 19 volcanic ash deposits distributed across northern Europe. The studies linked them to a specific volcanic eruption using geochemical methods; for example, ash from an Alaskan volcano was found as far away as Poland >7000 km from source **\[2\]**. For the first time, the replicability and reliability of glass shard size measurements was evaluated from peatland and lake archives. No consistent trend was found in the vertical sorting of glass shards by size within lake and peat sediments. The largest glass shards in the cryptotephra deposits were 250 µm \(longest axis basis\) and the median shard sizes of distal volcanic ash varied between 35 to 75 µm. Size distributions varied more between all sites than the within‐site variation displayed in our investigations, allowing for an examination of regional trends **\[5\]**. This body of research documented the size range of ash particles that can be transported long distances through the atmosphere. 

 The new database of deposited ash records allowed estimation of an approximately 20% chance of an ash cloud over northern Europe in any 10\-year period. The work also estimated the mean return interval of a volcanic ash cloud over the region to be 44 ± 7 years **\[1\]**. Tephra records from mainland northern Europe, Great Britain, Ireland and the Faroe Islands, compared with records of proximal Icelandic volcanism, suggested that an Icelandic eruption with a Volcanic Explosivity Index rating \(VEI\) ≥ 4 and a silicic magma composition presents the greatest risk of producing volcanic ash particles that can reach northern Europe **\[1\]**. None of the ash clouds in the European record which have a known source eruption are linked to a source eruption with VEI < 4. These results also suggested that ash clouds are more frequent over northern Europe than previously proposed from eruptions of both Icelandic and North American volcanoes. Together, these findings indicate the continued threat of ash transport through the atmosphere with particle size distributions likely to be similar to those we have already quantified **\[2\-5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull erupted on 20th March 2010. The relatively low volume eruption generated an extensive ash cloud, causing major air travel disruption over Europe. Iceland, UK, Ireland, and Finland experienced a 90% decrease in air traffic. The International Air Transport Association estimated the total loss for the airline industry was USD 1,700,000,000 \(GBP 1,180,000,000\). The Airport Operators Association estimated that European airports lost GBP 80,000,000 over six\-and\-a\-half days, with 107,000 flights cancelled across Europe during an 8\-day period accounting for 48% of total air traffic and roughly 10 million passengers. 

 <ins> *Impact during the REF2021 period*</ins> 

 Rapid decision\-making during the 2010 disruption was hampered by a lack of reliable data on the dispersion of ash shards, with the lack of assurances for aircraft engine tolerance in these conditions leading to inefficient responses by governments, stakeholders and airlines. Leeds research findings contributed to policy changes after 2015 for aircraft jet engine operations and maintenance through validation of ash particle sizes used in engine performance experiments. Engine performance results were then incorporated into simulations which have enabled airlines to update their planning and risk assessments for future disruptive ash clouds. 

 Following Eyjafjallajökull, NASA initiated the Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research \(VIPR\) Project \(2011\-2015\), involving four NASA centres plus partners including Rolls\-Royce. Part 3 \(VIPR III, 2015\) involved experiments where volcanic ash was injected into jet engines under controlled conditions, to gain increased understanding of the damage caused during different volcanic ash scenarios. NASA’s Principal Investigator on the VIPR project approached Swindles for his database, to overcome one of the major problems when evaluating the experimental design: “ *When preparing for the VIPR test we ran into a fairly good number of unknowns in regards to the composition of distal ash clouds. We were informed…that the average size of the particles would be smaller as the distance from the eruption increases, but we were also informed of several measurements of large particles at great distances. In general, there is a gap…in the knowledge of particle size distribution...more information on particle size would be very helpful”* **\[A\]**. 

 Our datasets enabled NASA and partners to determine that the ash used in experiments was representative of distal volcanic ash. The VIPR III tests subsequently led to a step\-change in policy from the “AVOID AVOID AVOID” approach previously advocated by the International Civil Aviation Organization \(ICAO\), and executed following the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010, to a level of safe operation in volcanic ash. Rolls Royce’s Capability Lead confirmed that **\[B\]** “ *Without independent particle size data confirming that the VIPR\-III experiments used realistic inputs, the confidence we had in the validity of testing would have been diminished. Similarly, the confidence we had in the conclusions we reached with regard to engine behaviour in volcanic ash would have been reduced, potentially leading us to declare a more conservative operating procedure*”. 

 Rolls\-Royce, which powers >35 types of commercial aircraft with over 13,000 engines in service around the world, including 13% of the jetliner fleet, has now established an ash dose test to define engine susceptibility to comply with the new EASA aircraft and engine certification regulations, for all Trent \(40% commercial aircraft\) and RB211 engines. New engine operational and maintenance policies within NASA and Rolls Royce were developed **\[B\]**: “ *The information obtained from the VIPR\-III test allowed our team here in Derby to complete work on defining safe operating limits for aircraft in dispersed volcanic ash environments, a position we released and made available for use in May 2017”.* The guidance stated **\[C\]**: “ *Engines exposed to a cumulative volcanic ash dose of 14.4 g s/m<sup>3</sup>, between 0.2 to 4 mg/m<sup>3</sup> \(e.g. operating for 1 hour in an actual ash concentration of 4 mg/m<sup>3</sup>\), or lower, should not lead to a significant reduction in engine related flight safety margins. If an exposure of 14.4 g s/m<sup>3</sup> is suspected to have been accumulated: Engine inspection required, followed by a decision to either: 1\) Set ‘clock’ back to 14.4 g s/m<sup>3</sup> or a smaller number, 2\) Commence a cleaning and monitoring regime, 3\) Remove engine for repair”*. A key conclusion of the work is that doses equivalent to operating for 60 minutes in an actual ash concentration of 4mg/m<sup>3</sup> will not lead to significant reductions in flight safety. 

 The Rolls Royce work was considered to be “ *ground\-breaking and has been acknowledged, amongst others, by EASA, Boeing and Airbus, and is being adopted by other aircraft engine manufacturers e.g. GE and Pratt & Whitney in the USA”* **\[B\]**.  The company’s position changes  to aircraft flight crew operating and maintenance manuals, were further noted by the Head of the Services for Aviation division at the World Meteorological Organisation \(WMO\): “… *such work has helped inform WMO’s work on advancing the scientific and technological developments in support of the ICAO* **\[D\]** *.* The ICAO position then informed the work of individual airline operators allowing them to decide on their operational regimes. For example, the flight operations manager of Hibernian Airlines explained that the Rolls Royce developments, and the Leeds body of research on volcanic eruptions, were used in the development of their *“risk assessment concerning VA* \[volcanic activity\] */ mitigation process and an understanding of potential frequency of eruptions affecting Europe*” **\[E\]**. 

 Ultimately, the changes pioneered by Rolls Royce and the subsequent uptake of their new position statement by airline operators around the world means that “ *another volcanic eruption like the Eyjafjallajokull eruption in 2010 will not lead to the same level of flight disruption. The* \[Rolls Royce\] *position will also minimise the flight disruption which regularly occurs in the more volcanically active regions of the world, such as SE Asia, Central America and the North Pacific. The work Dr Watson and Dr Swindles undertook has ultimately had a global impact*” **\[B\]**. 

 The Roll's Royce controlled ash dose work was integrated into a large\-scale ash cloud simulation event \(EUNADICS\-AV\) in March 2019 **\[B\]**. This work simulated operational centre displays for several large airlines in real time. Selected flights were played back via NAVSIM software connected to a flight simulator, to show both the operation in an air traffic control centre and in the cockpit. This work has informed airline planning for future ash clouds.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant childhood brain tumour, affecting approximately 70 patients each year in the UK. Current treatment methods are aggressive and often cause long\-term, life\-limiting side effects. Research by Associate Professor Edward Schwalbe at Northumbria University has led to the development of a novel diagnostic tool that quickly and robustly identifies four recognised molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma. This rapid assay, called MIMIC \( **Mi**nimal **M**ethylation **I**n **C**ancer\), enables identification of the important WNT subgroup of patients in as little as three\-to\-four days, compared with three\-to\-four weeks for established diagnostics, making it applicable for decision making in treatment. The MIMIC assay has been used in the European PNET5 trial that investigates whether WNT patients can be treated with lower doses of radiotherapy. Adoption through the PNET5 trial means that it may reach all of the medulloblastoma patients in Europe. Of these, 20 children from 11 UK centres were found to be suitable to receive a greatly reduced dose of radiotherapy. Lower doses of radiotherapy reduce side effects and lead to better quality of life after treatment. Economic benefits from this research include income for the company providing the test, NewGene, and clinical cost decreased by half.

 Schwalbe’s research is focused on improving outcomes for patients with medulloblastoma, the most common malignant childhood brain tumour, affecting approximately 70 patients each year in the UK and approximately 350 patients across Europe. Although cure rates have improved from 2% in the 1970s to approximately 75% in 2018, survivors face life\-long side effects of receiving radiotherapy to their brains, including poor general functional outcomes such as speech and hearing, a sustained drop in IQ, as well as difficulties forming relationships, completing schooling, and getting work. By improving tumour diagnostics, patients can receive treatments that are optimised for them, helping to reduce treatment side\-effects as far as possible while maintaining cure. 

 Four distinct molecular subgroups are well established: WNT, SHH, Grp3, and Grp4. Northumbria’s Schwalbe, in collaboration with colleagues from the Newcastle University research group led by Professor Steven Clifford, was the first to show how medulloblastoma could be classified into these four types through the application of DNA methylation microarrays \[ **R1**\- **R2**\]. Each group has distinct molecular, clinical, and pathological features, and patient stratification is an important step in determining the most appropriate course of treatment and follow\-up for each patient. For example, patients classified as belonging to the WNT subgroup have the most favourable outcomes and survival rates of approximately 95% \[ **R1**\], while patients with SHH subgroup tumours may benefit from specific inhibition of the SHH pathway as part of their treatment. 

 Unfortunately, the microarray route to disease profiling is difficult to implement clinically, particularly for diseases such as medulloblastoma. This is because the method requires batched assessment using multiple samples, has high sample input quality and quantity requirements, and is also expensive. To tackle these challenges, Schwalbe conceived a novel method through the characterisation of minimal DNA methylation signatures using mass\-spectrometry. The technique is called MIMIC \( **Mi**nimal **M**ethylation **I**n **C**ancer\) \[ **R1**\]. This assay is suitable for assessment of scant and/or poor quality pathological specimens, such as those acquired during surgery for routine histology, and has clear applications both to routine molecular subgrouping in patients and for unlocking previously\-inaccessible historical cohorts for contemporary molecular analysis. The technique was validated on 120 pre\-existing samples \[ **R1**\]. 

 The utility of the new MIMIC assay for informing treatment protocols via subgrouping was assessed by retrospectively applying it to samples acquired during the PNET4 medulloblastoma clinical trial \[ **R2**\]. The PNET4 trial ran from 2001\-2006 and was designed before the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma were identified. Unfortunately, no provision was made in the trial design to collect tumour material for this type of analysis. Only formalin\-fixed, paraffin\-embedded sections and cytosine nuclear preparations on glass slides remained, more suitable for microscopy. The DNA extracted from these specimens was insufficient for conventional subgrouping but was, however, successfully analysed using MIMIC. 

 Subsequently, Schwalbe and colleagues analysed the PNET4 trial findings, taking the resulting four subgroups and using these to identify a group of tumours with distinct patterns of chromosomal gain and loss that were associated with excellent \(100%\) survival rates \[ **R3**\]. Substantial biological heterogeneity and differences in survival were apparent within each of the four subgroups. Schwalbe and Clifford investigated whether additional molecular subtypes existed within Grp3 and Grp4, and whether these could be used to improve disease subclassification and prognosis predictions \[ **R4**\]. The patient group from the PNET4 trial was analysed in the light of these novel medulloblastoma subtypes \[ **R3**\]. 

 The new molecular subtypes described in 2017 \[ **R4**\] were refined in a 2019 study that was carried out in collaboration with German Children’s Cancer Centre in Heidelberg, Germany; St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee; and the Broad Institute in Boston, Massachusetts \[ **R5**\]. The work confirmed eight subtypes from the two subgroups \(Grp3 and Grp4\), which provides a foundation for future treatment risk stratification and clinical trial designs. 

 Schwalbe is now working to identify new subgroups by developing a DNA sequencing\-based successor to the MIMIC assay. This new assay will not only give information on molecular subgroup but will also assign novel subtypes of the four subgroups of medulloblastoma. Moreover, it will provide information on accompanying patterns of chromosomal gain and loss and, crucially, will be compatible with the upcoming reorganisation of National Health Service \(NHS\) genomic testing that is a consequence of the UK\-wide 100,000 genomes project.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Schwalbe’s research has made it more straightforward to identify medulloblastoma and classify the disease into its four major subgroups \(WNT, SHH, Grp3 and Grp4\). The assay developed for this classification can be used to support clinical practice, leading to improved treatment and better patient outcomes, ultimately reducing the burden on the NHS. 

 The four subgroups were only recognised by the World Health Organisation in 2016, which means that progress towards treatments relying on this classification is very recent. The MIMIC assay, underpinned by Northumbria’s research, enables clinically appropriate, rapid, robust, and economically viable identification of these four molecular subgroups by deploying Agena Bioscience’s Mass Array genetic testing system \[ **E1** DNA laboratory report confirms the use of MIMIC to classify Mass Array medulloblastoma data and refers to two publications by Schwalbe *et al.*\], a technique previously used for assessing mutations in cancer samples. 

 The development of the MIMIC assay has changed practice by being adopted as a subgrouping assay for the Europe\-wide PNET5 clinical trial \(trial ID: NCT02066220\) running from 2014 to 2024. This trial of standard\-risk medulloblastoma is investigating whether WNT patients can be treated with lower\-intensity therapies, aimed at minimising the side effects of treatment whilst maintaining the rate of cure. WNT patients enrolled in the trial receive a tailored and much\-reduced dose of radiotherapy, at 18Gy instead of the current standard dose of 23Gy \[ **E2**, p2\]. Simon Bailey, Chair Elect of the International Paediatric Oncology group \(SIOPE\), which designed and implemented PNET5, has confirmed the MIMIC assay *‘has enabled the routine and rapid subgrouping of tumour samples’* \[ **E3**\]. This is because of its efficacy in analysis of small sample sizes and improved turnaround times, enabling real\-time diagnosis \[ **E3**\]. 

 Adoption through the PNET5 trial means that all of the medulloblastoma patients in Europe are reached. The Royal Victoria Infirmary Hospital at Newcastle coordinates samples from 11 centres in the UK. Since 2016, it has commissioned the MIMIC assay for 56 patient samples \[ **E4**\]. Since the assay is rapid, it is compatible with clinical decision\-making. After surgical removal of the tumour, patients recover for 30 days before receiving chemo\- and/or radiotherapy, and any molecular analysis needs to be completed within this time. The Great North Children’s Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne is one of the major centres treating children with paediatric brain tumours in the UK. Simon Bailey, a Consultant in Paediatric Oncology at the hospital \(who also serves as the chair of the SIOPE trial\), stated: 

 *‘These tailored therapies can only be achieved with real time molecular diagnostics. From a clinical perspective, the turnaround time of MIMIC is much more rapid than alternative assays \(median 8 days\) \[and can be as little as three\-to\-four dates, compared to three\-to\-four weeks using previous methods\] and allows real\-time rather than retrospective decision making. The MIMIC assay has allowed clinically useful molecular subgrouping to be done robustly and rapidly, to aid treatment stratification and prognostication’* \[ **E3**\]. 

 The implementation of the assay has enabled patients with WNT subgroup medulloblastoma – a group associated with a particularly good prognosis and survival rate – to be identified and stratified into the appropriate treatment arm of the PNET5 trial. This lessens the intensity of radiotherapy. In the UK, 20 patients have been classified with WNT tumours since 2016 and were deemed to be suitable candidates to receive reduced doses of radiotherapy \[ **E3**\]. Simon Bailey confirmed: 

  

 *‘Lowering the dose of radiotherapy can lead to better patient quality of life post\-treatment, so only giving a dosage that is required and no more can have huge benefits for the patient in terms of quality of life. These tailored therapies can only be achieved with real time molecular diagnostics … The PNET5 trial is still ongoing; however, it is important to mention that no excess relapse has so far been shown in patients with lower treatment doses, with lower incidences of neurocognitive deficits being seen. In short, the use of the assay has led, so far, to more appropriate treatment doses and better outcomes for patients’* \[ **E3**\] *.* 

 The MIMIC assay is delivered using Agena Bioscience’s Mass Array genetic testing system \[ **E5**\]. Since 2016, NewGene has used this system for subgrouping medulloblastoma in the UK \[ **E6**\]. NewGene is an NHS\-accredited molecular diagnostics company. The company runs the assay to Good Clinical Laboratory Practice compliant standards for clinical samples and to a defined standard operating procedure. It also provides a clinical report in a standardised format which makes use of a classification web server developed for this project. This takes the test out of the lab and enables its use in clinical practice. Angela Silmon, The Operational Director of the Yorkshire and North East Genomic Laboratory Hub \(GLH\), said: 

 *‘Dr Schwalbe wanted to develop and optimise an assay using this platform \[Agena Bioscience’s Mass Array genetic testing system\] for the routine classification of medulloblastoma molecular subgroups using characteristic DNA methylation signatures … Dr Schwalbe developed the algorithm to classify medulloblastoma samples into molecular sub\-groups. We worked with Dr Schwalbe to optimise the assay and determine how to implement it clinically. As a result of this, it enabled NewGene to develop an expertise in a new method of detecting DNA methylation signatures without additional capital investment’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 Since 2016, NewGene has performed \[text removed for publication\] tests at a price of \[text removed for publication\] per test, giving the company new income of \[text removed for publication\] \[ **E6**\]. The economic benefits of this price extend to the user too. For example, in Spain the previous test cost nearly twice as much as MIMIC \(approximately \[text removed for publication\]\) \[ **E7**\]. 

 As a result of its use by the Yorkshire and North East Genomic Laboratory Hub \(GLH\) – an NHS service which has provided genetic analysis for inherited and acquired diseases since 2018 – the NewGene assay has become an NHS provision and elevated the profile of the GLH. Angela Silmon said: *‘This development provided the company with a competitive edge in the market and excellent international reputation and raises the profile of the Yorkshire and North East GLH. This would not have been possible without Northumbria University and Dr Ed Schwalbe’* \[ **E6**\]. 

 The wider applicability of the assay to any disease characterised by differential DNA methylation patterns has resulted in training and knowledge exchange activities for European groups. These include the Karolinska Institute \(Stockholm, Sweden\) and the Leiden University Medical Centre \(Netherlands\), working in partnership on the development of equivalent assays.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Panos Vostanis since 2004 and through the World Awareness for Children in Trauma Programme \(WACIT\) is improving mental health services for children traumatised by war, displacement and abuse. Since 2015, WACIT supported >44,000 children and their carers worldwide to cope with trauma. Vostanis trained 1,200 front\-line professionals in 14 countries to recognise trauma in children, implement psychosocial interventions, reduce stigma, and improve mental health and education for children. Vostanis’ research informed global policies and practices, including UNESCO trauma\-reduction policies \(2018, 2019\) and The World Health Organization’s 2018 care guidance for one million asylum\-seeking children registered in the EU. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The United Nations estimates that >1billion children worldwide suffer complex trauma from war, displacement, violence, and disadvantage. Prof Panos Vostanis’ research shows that these children experience 40% higher rates of mental health disorders \( **MHD**\)—depression, anxiety, self\-harm, post\-traumatic and conduct disorders—by the age of 18 than the general population **,** with adverse outcomes into adulthood including unemployment, criminality, sexual exploitation, and homelessness \[ **R1, R2, R3**\]. 

 Vostanis and team established high psychopathology rates for looked\-after and displaced children in Britain. Children looked after by local authorities are four times more likely to develop MHDs than children living with their families \(46.4% versus 8.5%\) \[ **R1**\]. Vostanis and team \(2007\) examined socio\-demographic characteristics and psychopathology among looked\-after children in Britain’s local authority care, compared with children in private households. Psychiatric disorders and severe behavioural difficulties were particularly high among children living in residential care, who may have also experienced multiple placements \[ **R1**\]. Vostanis’ studies of children traumatised by displacement and homelessness \[ **R2**\] showed severely high risks of MHD, sexual exploitation, and acute psychosocial problems. 

 Globally, Vostanis and team studied the impact of war and displacement \[ **R3, R4**\] on children. Childhood trauma can begin in utero from maternal stress, which can cause undernutrition, stunting, and negatively impacts on children’s cognitive, physical and socio\-emotional development \[ **R3**\]. For example, studying 403 Palestinian children aged 9\-15 in four refugee camps, children reported experiencing a wide range of traumatic events, both direct experience of violence and through the media, reporting sleep disturbance, impulse control, and difficulties in concentration \[ **R4**\]. Vostanis’ British study showed that trauma interferes with education and social interactions, requiring teacher training to implement preventive interventions \[ **R5**\]. These findings support the need for global inter\-agency focus on *children’s needs* and *carers’ skills* integrated to existing service systems. 

 **Vostanis and team subsequently developed the **global** WACIT Programme \(2015 \- 2020\)** \[ **R8a,b**\] a six\-step strategy to implement early intervention to meet children’s mental health needs in low\- and middle\-income countries \(LMIC\). The team implemented their *Practice\-Focused Training on Mental Health Awareness, Recognition and Formulation of Care Plan* **to train 23 networks and 16 service delivery agencies in 14 countries**. The WACIT Team: **1.** Worked with children and parents to establish stakeholder *readiness* in Kenyan disadvantaged communities. This revealed barriers from stigma towards MH and disability, disengagement of parents and communities, lack of culturally adapted interventions, and limited resources \[ **R8a**\]. The Team devised service transformation strategies and an online module with stakeholder input \[ **R8a,b**\]. 

 **2.** Developed and implemented *practice\-focused training* to upskill care networks in six vulnerable LMIC target groups: Turkey \- street and refugee children; Pakistan \- slum areas; Indonesia \- orphanages; Brazil – favelas; Rwanda \- care homes; and Kenya \- slum areas following ethnic displacement \[ **R8b**\]. 

 **3.** Created the *WACIT Service Transformation Framework* \(STF\) and training manual \[ **R8a**\], implementing children’s rights, ecological systems, and hierarchy of needs. The WACIT STF is designed to improve mental health service provision across six psychosocial domains of: 1\) safety; 2\) carer support; 3\) schools and communities; 4\) upskilling frontline practitioners and community volunteers; 5\) counselling and psychological interventions; and 6\) access to mental health services. 

 **4.** Designed action plans for *community awareness* in Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa and Brazil for child and family empowerment; interdisciplinary working; and skills development, supported with the user\-led online module \[ **R6**\]. **5.** Interviewed 353 disadvantaged *children* in Turkey, Pakistan, Kenya, South Africa and Brazil to capture their *voices* relating to *help\-seeking and resilience strategies* \[ **R8a,b**\]. 

 **6.** Delivered leadership training to 14 university partners in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil, building on the WACIT programme’s training and educational resources \[ **R8a,b**\].

 <ins> **Changing worldwide policies and support for traumatised children and carers**</ins> 

 The **World Health Organization** \(WHO\) \(2018\) used \[ **R7, R8b**\] evidence—that displaced children often internalise MHD— **to design targeted health care guidance for 1million asylum\-seeking children registered in the EU, including 200,000 unaccompanied children** \(2015–2017\) \[ **E1**\]. WHO \(2016\) drew on Vostanis et al.’s school mental\-health models \[ **R5**\] to recommend targeted school programmes **to improve literacy for displaced children** \[ **E1**\]. 

 Vostanis and Team’s evidence associating parent/carer support with PTSD reduction in war children and refugees \[ **R3, R6, R7, R8a,b**\] informed several **UN** and **UNESCO** recommendations. \[ **R3, R7**\] informed the UN’s *Global study on children deprived of liberty* \(2019\) and *Occupied Palestinian Territory Report* \(2016\), with both **recommending law, policy and practice safeguards to reduce stigmatisation of displaced children and protect their human rights** \[ **E2**\]. UNESCO \(2015\) implemented \[ **R6, R7, R8a,b**\] findings to **recommend evidence\-led training to reduce PTSD** by embedding caretaker/family communication and activities with traumatised Palestinian children \[ **E3**\]. UNESCO’s Policy Papers \(2019, 2015\) directly drew upon \[ **R5, R8b**\] to recommend an integrated programme involving schools, healthcare, communities, teachers, and families, to holistically support traumatised children \[ **E3**\]. 

 **The NSPCC** *Priorities for Change* \(2015\) \[ **E4**\] and the **Department for Education** \(DOE\) report \(2015\) \[ **E5**\] implemented the Team’s findings that carers may be unequipped to manage MHD in looked\-after children \[ **R1 – R3**\], **recommending carer/child interventions to prevent placement and attachment breakdown**. The NSPCC \(2016 *\) Case for Change* used \[ **R2**\] evidence **to demand mental\-health monitoring for infants in care to prevent later\-life MHD** \[ **E4**\]. The prevalence of unsupported refugee children with PTSD \[ **R4**\] informed the *European Union Policy Report* \(2019\) decision to **devise a national committee for inclusive systems in EU Member States**, integrating education, health and social services to support minority children – with refugees co\-designing anti\-bullying and anti\-prejudice curricular resources \[ **E7**\]. *The Migration Policy Institute Report* \(USA, 2015\) used \[ **R4**\] to **recommend multi\-agency educational and mental health interventions for Syrian refugee children** \[ **E6**\].

### 1.  Summary of the impact 

 Pre\-drill predictions of top seal integrity are fundamental aspects of petroleum exploration and subsurface sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub>; incorrect predictions can result in dry holes which cost GBP10,000,000s per well. Traditionally companies have used core and wellbore data to estimate oil and gas column heights that could be supported without leakage. The Cartwright research group has shown how the use of 3D seismic data can be used to better assess leakage bypass systems. The Oxford work has established and quantified the role of seal bypass systems in top seal failure and secondary hydrocarbon migration. This entailed characterising their diagnostic features on seismic data, and developing interpretational techniques to constrain both the timing and flux of hydrocarbons leaking from the reservoirs and the boundary conditions governing leakage. This workflow is now widely used by industry to assess the risk of top seal failure. The resulting data, practical knowledge, training courses and digital analyses are now embedded as fundamental components of workflows for seal risking and exploration play analysis by major international companies \(e.g., Shell, ENI, Equinor\) as part of their global exploration process and in their carbon capture and storage \(CCS\) operations. This work has undoubtedly saved many GBP10,000,000s in wasted investment, through reducing the risk of drilling into traps where the bulk of the hydrocarbons have leaked. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Leakage from reservoirs through top seals is one of the major causes of exploration failure in the hydrocarbon industry and is a major negative factor in choosing sites for CO<sub>2</sub> storage. Standard practice for risking top seal integrity prior to drilling is to focus on the physical properties of the sealing sequences and the fluid pressure distribution from reservoir to top seal. Prior to the Cartwright research group, relatively limited emphasis was placed on identifying potential leakage pathways within the sealing sequences that intrinsically pose a risk to seal integrity by virtue of their static or dynamic permeability. 

 Since 2012 the Cartwright research group has: 

 1. Identified leakage from a large range of sub\-surface reservoirs, documented the variability of seismic characteristics of leakage phenomena, and determined the key factors influencing leakage potential and top seal integrity in the presence of seal bypass systems **\[1\-3\]**. 

 2. Shown how the development of extremely high overpressures resulting from rapid loading and unloading of sedimentary basins can be a cause of high flux leakage through thick evaporitic top seals. Evaporite sequences had been considered by the petroleum industry to be ‘perfect’ seals, but the Cartwright research group showed that hydrocarbons can and do leak at high fluxes through such seals, under conditions of exceptional overpressure **\[4,5\]**. 

 3. Quantified the pressure regime leading to catastrophic breaching of hydrocarbon accumulations and demonstrated the range of geological processes that can lead to significant loss of hydrocarbon volumes from reservoirs **\[3,5,6\]**. 

 The research was undertaken by Cartwright’s \(Shell Professor of Earth Sciences 2012\-2017\) group between 2012 and 2020, funded by Phase 3 of CAPROCKS \(2012 to 2013; by a consortium of major oil companies\) **\[G1\]**, and three major grants from Shell \(2012\-17; 2018\-20; 2019\-2021\) **\[G2, G3, G4\]**, with major contributions by Cartwright’s PDRAs Foschi \(2013\-2020\), Bertoni \(2013\-2018\), and Kirkham \(2016 \- 2020\). Additional NERC funding for field research **\[G5\]** has helped to further quantify leakage. The work is underpinned by nearly 100 papers since 2012 in collaboration with a range of industry and academic partners. 

 Five papers published between 2014 and 2020 **\[1\-5\]** established the conceptual framework for identifying and risking leakage phenomena using seismic data. This research was undertaken with collaborators in industry \(BHP, **\[1\]**; Shell, **\[2\]**; Statoil, **\[5\]**\) and in academia \(Georgia Tech, **\[4\]**\). Significant advances included the identification of major direct hydrocarbon indicators hosted in non\-reservoir facies **\[1,2\],** the development of a genetic model for the origin of fluid escape pipes **\[4\],** and the development of a systematic workflow integrating seismic observations of leakage with hydrocarbon column heights and distributions to establish leakage volumes **\[3\].** This latter work also established the importance of dating leakage events using seafloor expulsion phenomena. Dating leakage is critical if trigger mechanisms are to be elucidated and flux is to be calculated, and dating is also an integral part of predicting leakage phenomena and for providing constraints for petroleum system modelling. Three papers **\[1\-3\]** set out the workflow for analysing leakage timing and fluxes. The research on hydrocarbon prospects **\[2\]** and known hydrocarbon accumulations **\[3\]** identified clear end members in leakage structures that link directly to the driving pressure in the reservoir and the permeability heterogeneity structure of the sealing sequences. For example, **\[3\]** documents a major leakage of gas from the Scarborough Field, offshore Australia, dating this to the past 200 Ka, and explaining the distribution of leakage phenomena as being due to aquifer overpressuring. This is critical knowledge for making better predictions of seal integrity ahead of the drill bit. 

 Abnormally high aquifer pressures are found to lead to highly focused leakage plumes, expressed typically in fluid escape pipes **\[4\-6\],** whereas more diffuse leakage occurs under lower pressure gradients in more heterogeneous top seals **\[2\].** This work is directly relevant to CCS operations where CO<sub>2</sub> injection could lead to unexpectedly high aquifer pressuring. Extreme aquifer pressures were shown to be responsible for large flux, episodic leakage of reservoired hydrocarbons through thick evaporitic sealing sequences, demonstrating for the first time that the most efficient petroleum seals can be breached under specific, albeit rare conditions. This work was published in Basin Research in 2018, and won the best paper award from the EAGE **\[5\].** Fluid escape pipes crossing evaporite seals were shown to be the result of rapid loading and unloading of the basinal succession, or to abrupt changes in the stress regime \(tectonic overpressuring\). Identification of leakage through hydraulic fracture networks allowed the first reconstruction of paleo\-pressure evolution in a reservoir, a novel method for basin\-scale fluid pressure analysis, undertaken in collaboration with SpectrumGeo **\[6\].** The seal analysis workflow allows explorers and sub\-surface engineers to establish the timing, priming and triggering mechanisms and migration processes involved in leakage events, which underpins Oxford’s current research aimed at further quantifying leakage fluxes, funded by Shell **\[G4\].**

###  4. Details of the impact 

###  ‘Impacts on practitioners and delivery of professional services’ 

 From 2013, Oxford research has led to conceptual frameworks being adopted by hundreds of explorers, achieved through training courses and leading to changes in how the risk of reservoir leakage is assessed. Traditionally core analysis of capillary pressures and leak\-off tests were used to assess column height. The use of 3D seismic data has provided a step\-wise improvement in top\-seal and by\-pass systems analyses on a field\-wide scale. Block grant funding from Shell to Oxford has provided a major catalyst for this impact. Professor Cartwright has delivered 8 courses on the seismic workflow since 2013 through Nautilus Ltd to 150 explorers and seismic interpreters from 17 different exploration companies, in London, Stavanger, and Kuala Lumpur. In\-house knowledge transfer workshops have been delivered through exchange visits with Equinor, ENI, Anadarko, BP and Shell in 2013/14, and for Shell in 2015/16/17/18 in Houston, Holland and Kuala Lumpur \(12 courses and 247 attendees\). The Chief Scientist and Vice President Research Strategy for Shell notes: *“The material provided by Oxford was initially transferred by workshops and courses, secondments, and an atlas to specific staff in Shell. It has now \(from 2018 on\) become an integral part of the in\-house training programme.”* **\[TL1\]** 

 From 2015, Oxford research discoveries led to industrial partners using the results in screening of exploration acreage for new plays and opportunities through better identification of leakage phenomena on seismic data. The Exploration Discipline Lead within Shell notes: *The research has directly contributed to the improved conceptual understanding of seal risk within Shell, and this background knowledge has been widely disseminated. The confidential final report sets out the theoretical foundations of seal bypass and leakage from reservoirs and presents valuable case studies from Shell’s exploration portfolio \(plus other non\-proprietary sources\) that demonstrate the mechanisms of secondary \(cross\-stratal\) hydrocarbon migration and the processes leading to leakage from hydrocarbon reservoirs. This is the first comprehensive and consistent guide to the interpretation of the seismic anomalies that reflect vertical fluid migration and as such is an important aide to our existing seismic interpretation workflows. . . . our seismic interpreters are now more generally aware of seal bypass features and the risks they can pose for exploration prospectivity.* *The Atlas has been incorporated into the Shell Exploration Guidelines and Standards and is used as a reference to help explorers interpret seismic anomalies in a consistent manner.* **\[TL4\]** 

 Longer\-term dissemination of the Oxford research into professional practice has taken place through the training of PhD graduates supervised by Cartwright, many of whom have taken up senior positions in exploration companies globally. Since 2013, he has supervised 13 PhD students, in projects linked to the risking of top seals or hydrocarbon migration, 7 of whom have entered the petroleum industry. 

###  ‘Impacts on production – research leads to improvement in productivity and resource\-use efficiency’ 

 **Seal Risk Analysis:** The research undertaken by the Cartwright research group has led to the adoption during the review period of a more systems\-based approach to top seal risking by Shell International, Equinor and ENI, along with a group of companies that participated in the CAPROCKS consortium **\[G1\].** Shell is ranked second largest oil company in the world by revenue by the oil and gas journal, Equinor is the largest oil company operating in Norway, and ENI was ranked the most successful oil exploration company for replacing reserves for the last few years by the Financial Times. This approach involves identifying the seal bypass systems classified by the Cartwright research group and assigning risk of failure values to prospects using the novel seismic interpretational workflows developed at Oxford. The Chief Scientist and Vice President Research Strategy for Shell International notes: *“They* \[Oxford\]  *have recently \(2019/20\) also established a rigorous and repeatable workflow based on automated 3D seismic interpretation whereby the specific leakage paths feeding hydrocarbons into seismically detectable reservoirs can be mapped and estimates made of the relative timing of leakage.”* **\[TL1\]** 

 From 2013, the Cartwright group developed systematic methods for the assessment of seal risk based on seismic interpretational workflows. Seal risk analysis is a critical and poorly understood component of assessing the commercial potential for an exploration prospect, and analysing the risk of seal failure is largely a question of managing the unknowns in the complex processes that lead to a viable seal being present. 

 The Cartwright research group provided to the global exploration community a framework or workflow for risking the role of seal bypass systems in the overall analysis of seal integrity. ENI have deployed this workflow across the company: “ *\[Cartwright’s\] latest work at Oxford \(post 2015\) has been to more directly link observations with risk analysis by quantifying the timing and effective permeability of the bypass systems…The direct benefits of Professor Cartwright’s research are widely rooted in ENI in the higher level understanding of the processes that can compromise seal quality…..and also in highlighting to our seismic interpreters the range of geological features that can lead to seal bypass. Professor Cartwright and his team has undoubtedly saved ENI many 10s of millions of pounds in wasted investment …”* **\[TL2\]** 

 The significant impact of the quantitative nature of the research at Oxford from 2018 onwards is also clearly highlighted by an Exploration Vice President \(Brazil\) for Equinor who says: “ *His latest work in particular is of significant commercial value in exploration in salt basins, because he has been the first to identify and quantify major seal breaching, of really thick evaporite sequences…..His quantification of seal integrity and overpressure development in the case study of the Eastern Mediterranean has wide application potential for the petroleum exploration industry, because there is so much activity in major salt basins. Professor Cartwright’s work on topseal characterization is widely used by explorers and seismic interpreters within Equinor.”* **\[TL3\]** 

 **Exploration Play Analysis:** The conceptual advances on seal risk and the translation of those into seismic interpretation workflows, through new insights into the mechanisms of dominantly vertical secondary hydrocarbon migration, have also been adopted by a number of oil companies from 2016 onwards in exploration play analysis. Play analysis \(the analysis of the distribution of reservoirs, traps, seals and migration pathways on a basin scale\) is the process by which explorers identify regions with petroleum exploration potential and involves an analysis of all the possible migration pathways for oil and gas to be transported from the source region to the trap. By way of commercially contextualising this work for global hydrocarbon exploration, the loss of hydrocarbons through the seal failure has been estimated in a recent Exxon study of dry holes to account for >50% of all failed exploration wells **\[S1\].** Given that each well typically costs more than USD50,000,000, the conceptual advances in seal risk achieved by the Cartwright research group can lead directly to more realistic exploration risk analysis with huge concomitant commercial potential. These advances result in more efficient exploration to conserve the environmental impact of drilling \(by drilling fewer wells\). 

 The Cartwright group research during 2012 to 2020 led to a breakthrough in understanding of vertical migration pathways, an essential component in deciphering hydrocarbon plays in any basin. The research results produced since 2015 **\[1\-6\]** have allowed explorers to identify migration pathways directly from seismic data, and also identified novel processes by which hydrocarbons can migrate vertically across thick evaporate sequences, opening up new potential in many salt basins. The Senior Vice\-President Exploration Strategies for ENI highlights the significance of the impact of this research: “ *Evaporite seals have traditionally been viewed by the petroleum industry as the most effective of all seal types, so it was a really significant finding that large fluxes of pre\-salt fluids can penetrate these seals to migrate into the post\-salt stratigraphy. This has wide potential significance for exploration in the many salt basins in the world \(both in seal integrity and secondary migration into post\-salt traps\), and for safe drilling \(since it points to extreme overpressure\). ENI has considerable exploration acreage in such basins \(e.g. Eastern Mediterranean\), so this work is of direct and immediate relevance in our exploration campaigns in the region.”* **\[TL2\]** The Chief Scientist and Vice President Research Strategy for Shell International adds: *“This work has contributed to a new consistency amongst Shell workers in the prospect\-risking process for frontier exploration plays. It has greatly enhanced value generation from the program in itself, but also Shell\-internal programs in for example sea floor scanning of fluid systems as well as more general interpretation of reservoir fluid effects were greatly helped by this work. The commercial benefit of the work lies in improved decision\-making: which prospects to drill, which not to drill, and, though hazard avoidance, where specifically to drill them. The commercial value of the work derives from improved drilling efficiency and lower finding costs and will average out to tens of millions of dollars per year for a company the size of Shell.  There are also the intangible benefits for example increasing capability with staff as well as increase safety and reduced environmental exposures related to better\-targeted drilling.”* **\[TL1\]** 

 **Carbon capture and storage \(CCS\):** In addition to the impact on hydrocarbon seal risking, safe drilling, and commercial exploration viability, the Cartwright research group work can be directly transposed into a similar workflow for seal prediction in subsurface siting of CO<sub>2</sub> disposal by injection into shallow aquifers. The work has implications for UK Net Zero efforts, described by the Exploration Discipline Lead within Shell as “ *This improved understanding of seal risk is also applicable to CO<sub>2</sub> storage at scale – an area identified by the Committee on Climate Change that will have relevance to the UK as it strives to meet its Net Zero target*” **\[TL4\]**. Whilst noting future impact, this statement indicated that the work of Cartwright’s group is influencing Shell’s current decision\-making with respect to CO<sub>2</sub> storage.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Coordinated by Imperial’s Energy Future Lab, founded by **Prof. Brandon** in 2005, the following underpinning research activities were undertaken, which are testament to Imperial’s leadership in the area of emissions reduction for road vehicles: 

1.  Automotive body panels and chassis structures have conventionally been made from steel, despite the fact that using high strength aluminium alloys could significantly reduce their weight and thus reduce the emissions of the vehicles they support. This is because aluminium is difficult to form/stamp into the complex shapes required. A novel technology, Hot Form Quench \(HFQ®\), has been developed and patented by Imperial’s **Prof. Lin** and his team \(WO2011/058332A1\). HFQ enables high strength aluminium alloys to be stamped to form similar shaped components to those that have previously been produced using steel. New theories and experimental techniques have been created for the modelling and characterisation of materials at hot stamping conditions \[R1, R2\], significantly advancing the state\-of\-the\-art. For example, a continuum damage mechanics theory for modelling “forming limit diagrams” has been established \[R1\] for the first\-time. This theory has been implemented in the commercial simulation software Pamstamp by ESI \(A world leading software developer headquartered in France\), making it available to the global hot stamping industry for process optimisation. A unique test rig has been developed and patented \(U.S. Patent 15/751,605\), which enables, for the first time, forming limit diagrams to be generated for sheet metals at hot stamping conditions \[R2\]. 

 2. Development of turbochargers that harness the unsteady energy emerging from engines is essential to achieve high energy efficiency. The state of the art in design and engine air management only makes use of the steady components, thus forcing the design along lines of quasi\-steady operation. Critically, such an approach does not harness the full energy potential contained in an unsteady flow and implies sub\-optimal component choices \(leading to higher emission impact\). **Prof. Martinez\-Botas** was first to incorporate unsteady effects into turbocharger models, which has since become industry standard. The recognition of volume effects in the turbine \[R3\] is now common on all simulation methods for turbocharger matching. His group undertook the first unsteady 3D simulation of a turbocharger under pulsating conditions, bringing the device to real engine conditions \[R3\]. The recognition of unsteady conditions on the compressor \[R4\] has led to an improvement in the stability margin that it is being incorporated in engine design programs. 

 3. Research into materials processing methods suitable for intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells \(SOFCs\) was pursued by Imperial’s **Prof. Brandon** and colleagues since 2000. In particular, their work on ceria\-based electrolytes \[R5\] enabled the design of cells with lower operating temperature. Conventional SOFC technologies need to be held at around 800 °C to operated efficiently, which adds significant cost to the housing as it requires special materials. However, Brandon et al. showed that by changing the electrolyte material, it is possible to operate efficiently at less than 600 °C. Furthermore, the use of composite electrode materials to improve rate performance at low temperatures \[R6\] was demonstrated. This concept combined the properties of two ceramic materials synergistically, resulting in electrodes that facilitate the chemistry at the surfaces, as well as showing sufficient mechanical strength and low\-cost. These patented processing innovations enabled the use of porous steel as the cell’s support, which unlocked the path to the low\-cost technology sold by Ceres Power today. Based on these patents, Brandon and colleagues ultimately set up Ceres Power Ltd. in 2001.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The findings and recommendations from our research into collaboration and adoption of innovation in small agri\-food businesses have directly impacted on the content and development of food policy and strategy within Northern Ireland and across Europe. Our research recommendations have been adopted by policy makers in Bulgaria and Norway, leading to new measures in regional development strategies that have directly enhanced the innovation capacity of micro size agri\-food producers \(i.e. less than 10 employees\) **\(I1\)**. Within Northern Ireland our research has directly led to the inclusion of measures on inter\-firm cooperation into the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs \(DAERA\) Rural Development Programme **\(I2\)**.  Recommendations for a more co\-ordinated multi\-actor approach have been embedded within Northern Ireland’s Food Strategy Framework and our research has directly led to the formulation of a “Model Local Food Policy” for Northern Ireland councils **\(I3\)**. 
","
 **2.  Underpinning Research** 

 The case study refers to a body of related research projects since the early 2000s employing both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to address innovation and networks in small businesses and more recently those within the agri\-food sector. 

 The valuable contribution that small enterprises \(producers\) make within rural and peripheral regions to local food production has been widely acknowledged. The food sector generally is associated with incremental forms of innovation \(for example product adaptations rather than new products to the market\) and characterised by barriers to innovation, which include limited resources for R&D, and a lack of engagement with support agencies.  Growing attention has been paid in the rural studies literature to “alternative food networks” and “short supply chains”, where the production and consumption of food are more closely connected, for instance through farmers’ markets and other sales channels outside the conventional supermarket model. The importance of network building within this context has been highlighted: networks involving government support agencies and third level institutions are critical to sustainable rural development. However there has been relatively little research into how food producers engage with, and benefit from, networks for innovation and particularly the nature of relations between producers and support agencies; our research projects addressed this gap. The overall aim of the research was to explore how small firms innovate and how innovation may be supported by government and other public agency networks, in an agri\-food context. Thus the research had a strong industry and practitioner focus. 

 Early work by McAdam \(2004\) identified the need for network development in order to enhance innovative practice within small firms in peripheral locations such as Northern Ireland **\(R1\)**. This theme was later developed by McKitterick, Quinn, McAdam and Dunn \(2016\) in their research into innovation network development in the context of small food enterprises **\(R6\)**. 

 McAdam \(2013\) argued that developing radical innovation in terms of new products/services within small firms in peripheral regions would need further policy and support intervention. This is due to innate SME limitations, such as lack of resources and skills, which are further limited by locational factors **\(R2\)**. Nonetheless, a further study by McKitterick, Quinn, McAdam, and Dunn \(2016\) challenged existing assumptions on the nature of innovation in micro size agri\-food businesses by identifying radical forms of innovation in practice, for instance new products in categories such as craft cider, baked goods and cheeses **\(R6\)**. This study found that relationships with informal networks such as family and friends, international sources and other businesses, rather than formal Government support networks, were instrumental in delivering innovation outputs in the form of new products. Informal business connections between micro food producers can emerge out of formal business support programmes and can be instigated by the participants or the business support advisors. While the research raised questions about the effectiveness of Government support for regional innovation, insight was provided into the critical role played by Government in fostering social capital and knowledge exchange and in acting as a bridge to informal networks. 

 A theme across a number of the underpinning research studies is the policy challenge in providing tailored and targeted support rather than generalised training and development \( **R1, R3, R4, R5, R6**\).  McAdam and Dunn \(2014\) identified the need to target support programmes according to the life cycle stage of the agri\-food SME network **\(R3** and **R5\).** Quinn, McKitterick, McAdam and Dunn \(2014\) recommended that tailored support would be needed to address the specialist needs of specific food categories such as artisan cheese **\(R4\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 A summary of the evidence of impacts and indicators is provided in Table 1 at the end of this section.  In Table 1, and in the text that follows, case letters and numbers in bold refer to evidence in Section 5. The **reach** of the impacts was evident through the direct influence our research has had on the development of economic policy at local, regional and international levels. The **significance** of the impacts, or how much difference our research has made to beneficiaries, is now outlined. 

 **I1 – European Regional Development Strategies** 

 Our research insights have had a significant impact upon policy development and stakeholder engagement across European regions, leading to changes in products and processes. Our earlier research on innovation in small firms \( **R1** and **R2**\) informed our work with European local authority partners through the INTERREG IVC LOCFOOD project \(2012\-2014\). From this project we identified best practices across 12 European regions: Northern Ireland; Valencia \(Spain\); Sofia \(Bulgaria\); Nordland \(Norway\); Litija and Kranj \(Slovenia\); Canton of Jura \(Switzerland\); Örebro and Västerbotten \(Sweden\); West Macedonia \(Greece\); Marche and Rimini \(Italy\) **\(C10\)**. These best practices were exchanged at a conference and series of policy\-maker workshops we co\-organised \(with Down District Council\) at Ballynahinch \(Northern Ireland\) in June 2014 to engage directly with policy makers at local and regional government levels **\(C3, C10\)**. The conference \(entitled “Making Small Producers Part of the Bigger Picture”\) was attended by 64 industry stakeholders including politicians, local authority representatives \(from Northern Ireland, Norway, Greece, Slovenia, and Sweden\), food businesses, trade associations and policy makers from Northern Ireland’s government departments **\(C10\)**. 

 Leading on from this conference, the research findings and recommendations from the LOCFOOD project \( **R4** and **R6\)** have had a transformative impact upon policy development and stakeholder engagement. As examples, two of the  regions, Sofia \(Bulgaria\) and Nordland \(Norway\), are presented in more detail. 

 We provided an evidence base for the Euro Perspectives Foundation \(EPF\) to support its policy development role for innovation and economic development within Sofia and at the national level more widely. Within the Sofia region our recommendations to EPF from the research and the best practice conference and workshops **\(C10\)** directly led to: 

-  the development of a short supply chain business model for small food producers through the establishment of farmers’ markets in Sofia **\(C1\)**. 

-  the development of measures on innovation in the food chain as part of the Regional Development Strategy \(2014\-2020\) **\(C1, C6\)**. 

-  new product development and business development opportunities for micro size food producers **\(C1, C6\)**. 

 By 2017, the Bulgarian short supply chain business \(farmers’ markets\) model for small food producers provided market access and increased sales for 25 small food businesses through direct access to consumers **\(C1\)**.  Within the same timeframe, our research findings informed the development of measures on innovation in the food chain within Sofia’s regional development strategy \(“District Strategy for Development of Sofia Region 2014\-2020”\). This led directly to transformational changes through the introduction of new products/processes in 42 small food businesses **\(C1, C6\),** including for example the organic production of goji berries. 

 In addition, in Norway we collaborated with Nordland County Council \(NCC\), the second largest of Norway’s 19 counties. The research recommendations contributed to the development of a new regional strategy for local food within Nordland \(“Strategy for Tourism and Experience Industries in Nordland 2017\-2021”\) **\(C2, C7\)**. NCC’s Deputy Director of Economic Development stated that: *“The direction and knowledge provided by Professor Quinn and his colleagues at Ulster University contributed vital input to NCC regional plans”* **\(C2\).** As a direct result of our research, NCC adopted our recommendation that a single organisation should co\-ordinate and manage information across the supply chain to improve communication and develop a better understanding of the industry: “ *One of the best examples of initiatives we see as a result from the LOCFOOD project in Nordland is a stronger connection between the three main public organisation\(s\) – Nordland County Council, Innovation Norway and the County Governor of Nordland… The need for a joint working group has proven to be of vital importance in this process”* \(email correspondence with NCC’s Industry and Development Manager, **C7**\) **.** The direct impact of our research recommendations in Norway is also evident at firm level in that the research provided direction for project support to approximately 100 businesses within the Nordland region **\(C2\).** Therefore, within both regions our research findings have directly led to the development of projects to stimulate the local food sector and have stimulated stakeholder activity.  As such the research has had a significant impact on the development of European regional food strategies. 

 **I2 – Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme** 

 There has been a clear impact at a regional level through government \(DAERA\) support for micro size food producers where, specifically, our research evidence \( **R3, R4, R5, R6\)** informed the development of the 2014\-2020 Rural Development Programme \(RDP\) and the Agri\-food Co\-operation Scheme **\(C3, C4, C8\)**. In particular **R5** and **R6** identified the need for intermediary organisations such as regional government agencies to stimulate innovation and assist collaboration between small \(micro size\) food businesses **\(C3\)**. Critically, at the “Making Small Producers Part of the Bigger Picture” conference and workshops in June 2014, the LOCFOOD project \(2012\-2014\), led by Professor Quinn, provided examples of best practices of cooperative activity in 11 other European regions that subsequently supported the establishment and strengthening of supply chains through collaboration **\(C4\)**. The conference was attended by DAERA policy makers who took part in the policy development workshops **\(C10\).** The best practices exchanged at the conference **\(C10\)** informed DAERA policy makers on their development of the Rural Development Programme, and specifically the content of a new policy measure on Agri\-Food Co\-operation \(Measure 16 \- Co\-operation, sub measures 16.3 and 16.4, **C8**\). The research was key in identifying micro firm cooperation as an area requiring support “ *as previously there was little evidence in this area and the best practices have helped in* *defining the types of projects that might be delivered”* \(email correspondence with DAERA Agri\-Food Policy Advisor, **C8**\). This has been supported by a testimonial from DAERA’s Assistant Director, Sustainable Agri\-Food Policy where she states that our research expertise has been utilised to provide *“a valuable source of evidence in support of the policy development process, both in defining the need for enhanced cooperation among micro businesses and identifying the benefits of co\-operation and shared resources. In addition, it has provided examples of co\-operative activity in other regions that has supported the establishment and strengthening of supply chains through collaboration”* **\(C4\)**. 

 **I3 \- Local Food Policies** 

 Within Northern Ireland, the findings from the LOCFOOD project have informed local council policy on the development of the local food sector **\(R4, R6\)**. The exchange of international best practice from the “Making Small Producers Part of the Bigger Picture” conference and policy\-maker workshops in June 2014 **\(C3, C10\)** identified key issues in regard to improving the policy environment for supporting the growth of artisan and micro size food producers in Northern Ireland. This was viewed by the Economic Development Manager at Newry, Mourne and Down District Council as “ *a particularly valuable exercise in helping to build local momentum and securing central government support for 2016 as Northern Ireland Year of Food and Drink”*, and one which provided a major platform for putting in place further policy to assist the agri\-food industry **\(C3\)**. The research led to the formulation of a “Model Local Food Policy” for Northern Ireland councils in 2014 \( **C9\)**, which assisted local councils in “ *taking an active role in the 2016 Northern Ireland Year of Food and Drink \(initiative\), providing identification of mechanisms for improved support for the local food sector, e.g. business development; tourism; local markets; procurement etc.*” **\(C3\)**. Elements of the “Model Local Food Policy” have been adopted by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council \(i.e. aligning support for artisan and micro businesses with tourism policy by ensuring that local food provision/sales opportunities are a key element of council events\) **\(C3\)**. From 2018 through to 2020, this evidence **\(R3, R4, R5, R6\)** has formed the basis for policy recommendations to DAERA on the development of a Northern Ireland Food Strategy Framework **\(C5** and **C9\)**.  In particular, the research findings from the LOCFOOD project \( **R4** and **R6**\) identified the lack of a co\-ordinated approach to communication across the public sector regarding the support that is available for food producers and, crucially, how small food producers may access that support. According to the Head of Future Food Policy at DAERA, the subsequent recommendation for a more co\-ordinated and integrated multi\-actor approach has been embedded within the policy and is “ *at the core of what the Food Strategy Framework is seeking to address”* **\(C5\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The project on the *Legal Regulation of Unacceptable Forms of Work* \(UFW\) led by Durham Law School has directly influenced global and domestic legal policy relevant to the 1,400,000,000 workers in the global labour force in low\-waged and insecure work. Specifically, it has led to: 

 **a. International and Global Impact**At the international level McCann’s research has contributed to a reframing of United Nations policy by shaping the agenda of the International Labour Organisation \(ILO\). This work has been incorporated into flagship ILO policy agendas on the Sustainable Development Goals \(SGDs\) and the *Centenary Declaration for the Future of Work*. The research has also been used by the ILO to create a framework for country\-level interventions aimed at developing and strengthening employment practices. 

 **b. Regulation of Unacceptable Forms of Work in Australia** 

 The research resulting from McCann’s Strategic Network on Unacceptable Forms of Work has directly influenced Australian policy and legal reforms on insecure work and gender equality. The Victorian government used McCann’s model of UFW as a framework for conceptualising insecure work which ultimately underpinned legislative change 

 **c. Tackling Exploitation in Wales** 

 The Welsh government drew on McCann’s model of UFW to underpin the employment dimension of Welsh migration policy, which is centred on tackling exploitation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The UFW project asks how unacceptable work can be eliminated. In countries around the world, 1,400,000,000 workers – including 42% of employed women – are in insecure, low\-waged, unsafe jobs that do not provide a decent living for these workers or their families. Yet there has been a degree of confusion about how to identify and improve UFW. Research from the project resulted in the design of a model that can help policy\-makers to effectively identify unacceptable work and to design legal frameworks to upgrade it. 

 Drawing on McCann’s extensive research on precarious work and labour standards in low\-income countries \[e.g. R4, R5\], the project generated a Multidimensional Model of UFW that was designed to be used by policy\-makers to identify and address UFW \(co\-authored with Judy Fudge, Kent Law School\) \(2015\-2016\) \[R1, R2\]. The Multidimensional Model allows policy\-makers to identify \(1\) the substantive features of UFW \(e.g. low wages, long hours, underemployment, work/family conflict\); \(2\) the magnitude of these risks and any significant patterns e.g. concentration among certain groups of workers/sectors; and \(3\) effective regulatory interventions, based on a new strategic approach to UFW regulation that supports socio\-economic development, acknowledges the constrained resources of low\-income countries, and aims at expansive and sustainable effects. 

 The Multidimensional Model is designed to be globally\-applicable, recognising that unacceptable work varies across socio\-economic, regulatory, and cultural contexts \[R1\]. It reaches beyond existing models of low\-quality jobs by incorporating a regulatory dimension \[R1, R2, R3, R5\]. The overarching objective is to ensure that effective regulation can be integrated into global efforts to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 8 \(decent work and economic growth\). 

 McCann brought together a global network \- the Strategic Network on Legal Regulation of Unacceptable Forms of Work \- as PI on an ESRC Global Challenges Research Fund \(GCRF\) grant \(2017\) \(Grant number ES/P007465/1; GBP113,085\). This global interdisciplinary network of researchers and stakeholders from more than 90 institutions across 25 countries drew on the Multidimensional Model to map research and policy strategies on the key Global Regulatory Challenges to effective labour regulation \(casual work, weak enforcement, violence and harassment in the care economy, informal work etc.\) \(see further  [https://www.dur.ac.uk/law/policyengagement/ufw/ufw/](https://www.dur.ac.uk/law/policyengagement/ufw/ufw/)\). The work of the Network has generated further impact in Australia and Wales \(see Section 4 below\). 

 The research has been shortlisted for the ESRC *Celebrating Impact Prize*; Highly Commended in the Durham University *Impact and Engagement Awards*; and selected as an ‘Impact Case Study’ by the UK Global Challenges Research Fund \(GCRF\) \(to recognise outstanding impact from GCRF\-funded projects across all of the UK Research Councils\) \(all in 2019\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

####  Global impact: The ILO and UN Sustainable Development Goals 

 The UFW Project has made a core contribution to legal policy of the United Nations \(UN\) through the work of the International Labour Organization \(ILO\) – the UN Specialist Agency responsible for international law and policy on working life. Manuela Tomei, the Director of the ILO Conditions of Work and Equality Department, testifies to the “substantial impact of the project on global labour rights policy” \[E1\]. Sangheon Lee, the Director of the Employment Policy Department attests that the project has been “of great value to … the ILO’s efforts to develop robust policies towards achieving decent work in countries across the world.” \[E2\] 

 In 2013, the ILO identified as an Area of Critical Importance the elimination of Unacceptable Forms of Work \(UFW\) \(“in conditions that deny fundamental principles and rights, put at risk the lives, health, freedom, human dignity and security of workers or keep households in conditions of extreme poverty.”\) \(ILO *Towards the ILO Centenary* \(2013\), *The Director\-General’s Programme and Budget Proposals for 2014\-15* \(2013\)\). 

 Recognising that there was no comprehensive understanding of UFW or how to address it, the ILO “sought guidance … on conceptualizing and addressing this global problem” from McCann \[E1\]. McCann co\-authored a policy report \[E3\]; was advisor to the two units that lead the ILO’s efforts on eliminating UFW – the Conditions of Work and Equality Department \(e.g. submission to the ILO Governing Body \(executive\) discussion of UFW, \[E4, E1\] and the Employment Policy Department \[E2\]; and briefed the ILO Director\-General \(July 2017\). 

 Through these channels, the research has been “instrumental in generating a sophisticated concept of UFW that has been adopted in the work of the ILO.” \[E2\] Its particular influence is in outlining \(1\) the dimensions of UFW; \(2\) a strategy for local actors to determine intervention priorities; and \(3\) a strategic regulation approach \[E1, E2\]. 

 The research has been incorporated into four flagship ILO policy agendas on the UN Sustainable Development Goals \(SDGs\); the Universal Labour Guarantee and *Centenary Declaration for the Future of Work*; Unacceptable Forms of Work; and national employment policy \[E1, E2\]: 

-  **Sustainable Development Goals**: The research is central to the ILO’s work as the lead UN agency responsible for achieving the SDGs. It has been incorporated through the inclusion of UFW in the ILO’s platform for achieving the SDGs \(ILO *Decent Work and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development* \[E1\]. 

-  **Universal Labour Guarantee/Centenary Declaration.** As shown in the testimony by the Director of the ILO Employment Policy Department, McCann and Fudge’s model of UFW has also “evolved into” \[E1\] the notion of a Universal Labour Guarantee proposed by the Global Commission on the Future of Work \(2019\), a landmark commission chaired by the premiers of South Africa and Sweden \(ILO Global Commission on the Future of Work *Work for a Brighter Future* \(2019\) \[E1\]. The Guarantee was subsequently adopted in the ILO’s *Centenary Declaration for the Future of Work* \(June 2019\) \[E1\]. As the Director of the ILO Conditions of Work and Equality Department attests: “The project’s Multidimensional Model of UFW underpins the *Declaration* – the flagship instrument of the Organization in its centenary year – by proposing universal protections that extend beyond basic human rights to encompass working conditions \(wages, working hours, safety and health\) \[E1\]. 

-  **Unacceptable Forms of Work.** The research has also had what the Director of the ILO Conditions of Work and Equality Department describes as a “crucial influence” at the country\-level by providing a framework for ILO interventions on Unacceptable Forms of Work in Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Malawi, Morocco, Pakistan, Pacific Island countries, southern Africa, Thailand and Uzbekistan \[E1\]. 

-  **National employment policies.** The project’s “findings and recommendations on effective labour regulation \[are\] … exceptionally valuable to \[the ILO\] in developing and strengthening employment policies which fully integrate effective labour regulation,” as confirmed by the Director of the Employment Policy Department. In this regard, the research has influenced employment policy in China, Indonesia, Mozambique, the Philippines, South Africa, and Uganda \[E2\] and discussions with the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and OECD \[E2\]. 

####  National impact: insecure work in Australia/labour exploitation in Wales 

 The research has impacted labour law and policy in Australia and Wales through collaborations initiated as part of McCann’s ESRC Strategic Network on Unacceptable Forms of Work. 

 In <ins>Australia</ins>, the report of the Victorian Government’s *Inquiry into the Labour Hire Industry and Insecure Work* used McCann’s model of UFW as a framework for conceptualising insecure work \(\[E5\], pp 264, 266\-267; \[E6\]\). The regulatory approach from the research – specific regulation – underpinned legislative change: in response to the Inquiry, the Victorian Government legislated a licencing scheme for labour hire services that specifically regulates vulnerable categories of work \(Labour Hire Licensing Act 2018 \(Victoria, Australia\) \[E6\]. 

 The model has also been adopted by the Australian trade union movement, particularly influencing the Victorian Trades Hall Council \(VTHC\) \(a peak\-level TU confederation of 40 unions and 430,000 members\) through the efforts of Lisa Heap, Women’s Lead Organiser of the VTHC and a member of the UFW Strategic Network. Heap attests that “this research has been vital to the VTHC in shaping its policies on precarious work and gender discrimination” \[E6\]. In particular, she has used it in her work leading the State of Victoria’s first Women’s Rights and Safety Unit, a partnership between the Victorian state government and the union movement to address gender inequality among Victoria’s 1.5 million women workers \[E6\]. 

 The research has shaped the VTHC’s submissions to the *Inquiry into the Labour Hire Industry and Insecure Work* \[E7, p7\] in which it was “particularly valuable in offering a multi\-dimensional approach to resolving issues associated with insecurity that is more comprehensive and sophisticated than other models” \[E6\]. The research was also used in VTHC submissions to the Australian Parliament Senate Standing Committee investigation of *Gender Segregation in the Workplace and its Impact on Women’s Economic Equality* \(\[E8\], p 19\). 

 Heap also attests that her “engagement both with the UFW framework and the Strategic Network on Unacceptable Forms of Work was influential in the development of” *Victoria’s Women in Construction Strategy* – commissioned from Heap by the Victorian government to increase women’s participation in building and construction. Through Heap, the research also informed the work of the Victorian Ministerial Council on Women’s Equality, including in Victoria’s first ever Gender Equality Strategy, *Safe and Strong* \[E6\]. 

 In Wales, the research has shaped the Welsh Government’s policy on tackling workplace exploitation \[E9\]. The Government’s position paper on *Brexit and Fair Movement of People* drew on McCann’s model to underpin the employment dimension of Welsh migration policy, which is centred on tackling exploitation \[E9\]. The Model was used to develop the concept of a spectrum of exploitation in labour markets and helped to shape the Government’s response: forceful enforcement of labour legislation and the extension of collective bargaining and trade union access \[E9\]. This policy was subsequently developed by the Welsh Fair Work Commission to recommend social partnership legislation and a Fair Work Agency, both now forthcoming in a Social Partnership Act and Social Partnership and Fair Work Directorate \(2020\) \[E10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the fourth largest cause of death in the UK, remaining a major public health priority. King’s research has impacted NHS England and NHS organisations/stroke teams with: 

 1. analyses of future need and evidence gaps for planning/commissioning the NHS Long Term Plan; 

 2. evidence demonstrating that centralisation of services in urban conurbations is sustainable and cost\-effective; 

 3. evidence from national quality improvement programme data of patterns and predictors of care leading to clinical improvements. 

 Internationally, King’s research has evidenced reports on future impact and requirements to improve care, with action in European clinical societies, and has contributed to the Global Burden of Disease \(GBD\) estimates for stroke. Beneficiaries of this research include stroke survivors, care planners and providers, policy makers and politicians. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Stroke is a serious life\-threatening medical condition that occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. This can affect the body in many ways, both mentally and physically that have an impact on the person’s life. There are 100,000 new cases of stroke per year and 1,200,000 survivors living with stroke in the UK, more than half of whom have a disability resulting from it. 

 **King’s research estimates and predicts the epidemiology of stroke effects in patients.** King’s have identified inequalities in care and evaluated interventions to improve outcomes through two different pathways. In 1995, King’s researchers set up The South London Stroke Register \(SLSR\), a population\-based register recording all first\-ever strokes in patients of all ages living in Lambeth and Southwark, inner city South London. King’s have collected incidence, care and outcome data in a multi\-ethnic population of 25 years incidence with follow up annually \(7,000 patients\). In 2018, King’s began hosting The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme \(SSNAP\), a major national healthcare quality improvement programme based, with embedded research projects, in the School of Population Health and Environmental Studies \(500,000 cases\). SLSR is led by Wolfe and McKevitt while SSNAP is led by Rudd, Emeritus Professor and James, Visiting Professor. Since 2014, GBP6,000,000 in funding from various bodies such as European Commission and Department of Health and Social care have underpinned the impacts recorded in this case study. 

 **King’s analyses derive long\-term estimates of stroke risk and recovery.** Using SLSR data King’s researchers have shown that since 2000, there have been significant declines in incidence of ischaemic stroke \(based on 3,088 patients, 43% reduction, 137 to 78/100,000 population\) in all age groups but non\-significant reductions in the black population **\(1\)**. Analyses of outcomes \(2625 survivors\) demonstrate that 20% are alive at 15 years post first stroke, 10% have moderate/severe disability, 30% have cognitive impairment, and 39% have depression **\(2\)**.  The data collected through SLSR and SSNAP have contributed to the Global Burden of Disease Study \(GBD\), that has estimated the burden of premature mortality and disability in stroke **\(3\)**. 

 **King’s provides cost\-effective ‘cross city transformation’ options for stroke care.** King’s was instrumental in implementing the transformation of stroke services in London \(REF 2014\). With UCL and Manchester University, King’s has subsequently demonstrated in urban areas \(London and Manchester\) sustained or further improvements in care with improved outcomes **\(4\)**. In London there was a significant decline in risk adjusted mortality at 90 days \(absolute risk reduction of \-1.1% \(95% CI \-2.1 to \-0.1; relative risk reduction 5%\), indicating 168 fewer deaths during the 21\-month period after reconfiguration in a population of 8,200,000. There were significant declines in risk adjusted length of hospital stay in both areas \(\-2.0 days Manchester and \-1.4 London\) **\(4\)**. 

 **King’s provides explanatory insights into patterns of care delivery.** SSNAP research analyses have shown four distinct patterns of variation of receipt of effective stroke interventions: 1. diurnal pattern \(receipt of thrombolysis, brain scan times, dysphagia screening\); 2. day of the week pattern \(multidisciplinary team assessments\); 3. an off\-hours pattern \(thrombolysis door\-to\-needle time\); 4. a flow pattern \(quality changed sequentially across days\) \(timely stroke\-unit admission\) **\(5\)**. Mortality after stroke is associated with the intensity of weekend staffing by nurses but not 7 day a week ward rounds by stroke physicians **\(6\)**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The ultimate beneficiaries of King’s research are stroke survivors in the UK and internationally who benefit from improved evidence\-based services, less disability and longer lives. These impacts using King’s research are delivered through many beneficiaries including EU, governments, clinical organisations, NHSE, and NHS Trusts/Teams. 

 **King’s research leads to EU policy change and clinical professional organisational action.** In collaboration with the Stroke Alliance for Europe \(SAFE\), which includes 34 national patient organisations, King’s analysed SLSR and GBD data and produced the **EU Burden of Stroke** reports in 2017 **\(A.1\)**. These estimated the future impact of stroke, identified inequalities in stroke risk, shortcomings in prevention and acute care, and the lack of longer\-term care and outcome data. The significance of these reports was summarised: *“*As more people survive stroke, the burden of care and support is great and increasing. However, the implementation of guidelines, interventions and organised stroke care varies across Europe, contributing to variation in outcomes for stroke survivors **\(A.2\)**.” 

 Key findings were presented by SAFE and the European Stroke Organisation \(ESO\) of clinicians and researchers \(20,000 members\) to the EU Parliament, May 2017, after several years’ lobbying by SAFE for an EU action plan. Subsequently the research was highlighted by ESO’s Vice President at the 2017 ESO Conference special session \(clinicians, public, industry and researchers\) as “very important background information on the current state of stroke services and the burden of stroke **\(A.3\)**.” 

 The reported uptake of evidence\-based interventions fuelled debate amongst EU clinical leaders at their main conference \(2017\) and an invited expert workshop **\(A.4\)**. This has led to two EU and country specific guidelines: The Stroke Action Plan for Europe 2018\-2030 **\(A.5\)** and the Economic Impact of Stroke **\(A.6\)**. ESO’s Vice President has said that: “This is academia and experts coming together, along with the input from the patient organisations to give the advice that should be used for political purposes **\(A.3\)** *.”* 

 **King’s research plays a key role in NHS England policy.** King’s estimated the future impact of stroke and identified evidence gaps requiring research to enable successful implementation of the NHS Long Term Plan \(LTP\), the blueprint for the future NHS. King’s work **\(4\)** was cited for epidemiological estimates and service reconfiguration **\(B.1\)**. It’s stated in the LTP that *“*The existing national stroke audit \(SSNAP\) provides high quality information on the acute and inpatient rehabilitation care of stroke patients to improve stroke services *”* **\(B.1\)**. Specifically, in the Stroke Association’s State of the Nation Statistics that contributed to initially shaping the stroke LTP, King’s research is cited with 9 references **\(B.2\)**. 

 Additionally, findings from the EU stroke study informed King’s researchers in developing a stroke care pathway framework **\(B.3\)** against which they identified evidence gaps and research priorities for the  NHSE Stroke LTP. This gap analysis was published in the Future NHS Collaboration Platform in December 2020 **\(B.4\)** and will later be embellished through a series of seminars and prioritisation meetings with senior staff from NHSE and the Stroke Association. The platform supports practitioners and commissioners to access and exchange knowledge and information on transformation, across health and social care. 

 **Research by King’s positively impacts NHS Organisations and Clinical Teams.** The design of the SSNAP questionnaires has been shaped from inception by the SLSR data collection methods and tools **\(3,5,6\)**. SSNAP has been voted the most effective national clinical quality improvement programme in the UK for the last ten consecutive years by healthcare professionals involved in audit **\(C\)**. It produces annual reports and academic analyses in collaboration with King’s for all hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, showing demonstrable change in the stroke care structure and processes linked to improved survival. 

 Longitudinal SSNAP data on care structure and processes have already informed ongoing NHSE stroke LTP ‘delivery plan’ developments by identifying inequalities in care and comprehensive dataset requirements to meet the needs of clinicians, commissioners and patients by describing quality of care provided for stroke patients throughout the care pathway **\(D\)**. 

 Health economics analyses using SLSR and SSNAP data have informed the development of tools for planning and commissioning specific components of care on the pathway, such as  templates to estimate costs of implementing thrombolysis and early supported discharge under different scenarios used by NHSE, commissioners and NHS Trusts **\(E\)**. 

 A NICE Impact report \(2019\) reviewed the implementation of NICE recommendations in priority areas of stroke care, utilising SSNAP analyses to compile the report regarding 3 NICE guidelines, 2 quality standards, 6 technology appraisals and 7 interventional procedures **\(F\)**. Such reports are used by care commissioners and planners country\-wide to assess local implementation successes and how to improve standards. 

 SSNAP data have been further used to identify service issues requiring improvement, prompting change in at least 12 local quality improvement projects across the stroke care pathway \(acute care; assessments and rehabilitation; longer term care\) **\(G.1\)**. For example, one team used SSNAP data to identify an unmet need for psychological support, which prompted them to improve their goal setting processes with patients. Impact included increased self\-management, freeing clinician time, and reduced patient anxiety prior to discharge from the team **\(G.2\)**. 

 Data generated by King’s have also been used for Care Quality Commission’s \(CQC\) Insight Dashboards that summarise quality of care data, and by their inspectors, as exemplified by a report from 2017 **\(H\)**. 

 **Service transformation in London and Manchester was also informed partly by SLSR data via King’s research \(4\).** This led to declined mortality rates, indicating 168 fewer deaths per year with significant reductions in lengths of stay in hospital equivalent to 6750 fewer bed days a year **\(I\)**. In this REF period, reductions in mortality and length of stay were maintained in London. In both cities provision of evidence\-based interventions improved **\(I\)**. This evaluation is cited by the Stroke Association and the NHSE LTP **\(D, J\)**. 

 The media widely reported Professor Stephen Powis, NHS England’s Medical Director, citing the research at the 2019 NHS Confederation conference \(NHS Chief Executives\) and announcing plans to centralise specialist services for stroke patients across England. He stated: “Introducing quicker access to better treatment for stroke in London and here in Manchester has saved hundreds of lives and we now want to see them rolled out across the whole of the country” **\(K\)**.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Strathclyde fluorescence lifetime research continues to contribute to growth in the commercial success of spin\-out scientific equipment manufacturer HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd \(HORIBA\-IBH\). The company develops products exploiting the technical, operational and cost advantages of high repetition rate semiconductor light sources and photon detectors for markets spanning life sciences, healthcare, chemistry, nanotechnology, and solar energy. Recent expansion of its facilities in Glasgow has supported growth in HORIBA’s leading 16% share of the USD152,000,000 global fluorescence spectroscopy market in 2013 to 22% in 2020. Recently the company introduced rapid fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy \(FLIM\) for the study in real time of live cells and transient species which is impacting on a range of medical applications. Strathclyde and HORIBA’s collaboration was recognised through Institute of Physics Awards in 2019 and 2020.

##  2. Underpinning research 

###  Context 

 Fluorescence studies are key analytical techniques across many research and commercial applications, providing detailed information about both the emitting substance and its local environment. Beyond academic research, they are key tools in industrial biomedical research and diagnostics, the pharmaceutical industry, and in environmental monitoring. In particular, fluorescence lifetime techniques, which are independent of fluorophore concentration, photo\-bleaching, excitation intensity fluctuations, scattered light, and excitation and detection wavelengths, provide particular performance and implementation benefits compared with intensity\-based techniques, resulting in robust and easily calibrated analytical tools. An extensive body of time\-resolved fluorescence research, undertaken over the past two decades by Strathclyde’s Photophysics Group led by Prof David Birch, has spanned fundamental research studies of fluorescence mechanisms, development of novel instrumentation, and the implementation of techniques to a range of biomedical research and healthcare applications. 

###  Advances in fluorescence instrumentation 

 Research into the application of newly emerging light sources to time\-resolved spectroscopy has enabled the replacement of unstable spark flashlamps or complex and expensive mode\-locked short\-pulse laser systems with high repetition rate semiconductor light\-emitting diode \(LED\) and laser diode sources, resulting in smaller, more reliable and more cost\-effective systems. This, in turn, has extended the performance and usability of systems, thus expanding the market by opening\-up a wide range of applications to non\-specialist users. 

 One key research achievement was the development of LED sources, and associated drive electronics, operating at MHz repetition rates, representing a significant improvement on previous LEDs operating at \~10kHz. An inexpensive, miniaturized and portable blue\-green indium gallium nitride \(InGaN\) LED source and drive electronics produced \~1.9ns pulses at up to 10MHz. This LED source was shown to be ideal for faster acquisition of fluorescence decay data using time\-correlated single\-photon counting \(TCSPC\). Experiments confirmed agreement with previous results obtained with a Ti:Sapphire laser, but at around 1% of the capital and running costs \[ **R1**\]. 

 The capabilities of the LED approach were extended through collaborative research with IBH Ltd \(a spin\-out from Strathclyde co\-founded in 1977 by Prof David Birch and later incorporated into HORIBA as its TCSPC Centre of Excellence\). This led to the development of UV LED sources that enabled, for the first time, the routine and inexpensive excitation of protein intrinsic fluorescence decay using a semiconductor source, widening opportunities for solvated protein structural studies that had been unfulfilled since fluorescence was first observed from amino acids in the 1950s. The resulting paper reported excitation of the amino acid tyrosine at 280nm \[ **R2**\], and subsequent joint publications with IBH addressed the other two fluorescent amino acids tryptophan and phenylalanine. 

 More recent research has focussed on fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy \(FLIM\) which uses fluorescence lifetime for contrast rather than fluorescence intensity as used in conventional microscopy. Conventional FLIM is limited by its slow rate of sequential scanning of a sample. However, recent collaboration between Strathclyde, Edinburgh University and HORIBA\-IBH on single\-photon avalanche diode \(SPAD\) timing arrays has greatly enhanced the multiplexed data acquisition rates of FLIM \[ **R3**\] and led to a new product, the FLIMera. When combined with developments in software and firmware, a 192 x 128 pixel array, implemented in 40nm complementary metal\-oxide\-semiconductor \(CMOS\) technology, with individual pixel timing, has resulted in image capture times of 15s, a 64\-fold improvement on previous commercial scanning systems. This has enabled live cell imaging at video scanning rates of 30 frames per second. 

###  Application of fluorescence instrumentation advances to healthcare 

 **Study of early stage Alzheimer’s disease:** Alzheimer’s disease is thought to be triggered by beta\-amyloid \( *A*\) aggregating to form cytotoxic oligomers in the brain. These had previously been widely studied only in the later stages of development, with the limitation that the extrinsic biochemical probes used perturb the very local structure under study. The research described in \[ **R2**\] enabled, for the first time, the critical early stages of aggregation of *A* to be studied in native form using the fluorescence of *A*’s single tyrosine. As a result, elements of the causes of Alzheimer’s and potential therapies can now be studied in vitro at a molecular level without the distortions to the local environment caused by extrinsic probes \[ **R4**\]. 

 **Developing a smart sensor for diabetes management:** A long\-term collaboration with King’s College London School of Medicine and Guys Hospital on in vivo glucose sensing for diabetes management using fluorescence lifetime sensing has led to an improved performance non\-invasive Concanavalin A\- based smart sensor for serum glucose. The sensor utilises transdermal red light excitation, which enhances signal fidelity by minimising the fluorescence of endogenous species \[ **R5**\]. This demonstrated the digital advantages of laser diode TCSPC in a non\-invasive sensor compared with analogue frequency domain lifetime measurement used previously, and encouraged diabetes researchers to consider TCSPC as a method of data acquisition. 

 **Improved FLIM for medical diagnostics and surgery:** Rapid FLIM with SPAD arrays and 100MHz pulsed laser diode sources have also been investigated for new methods of fluid biopsy for cancer screening based on the Strathclyde group’s development of a cancer biopsy using gold intracellular nanoprobes. This detects a tumour cell when a messenger RNA cancer biomarker releases a plasmonically\-quenched dye bound to a complementary single\-stranded DNA hairpin. This increases the fluorescence intensity and lifetime, thereby uniquely identifying the cancer gene of interest \[ **R6**\]. A 2020 Strathclyde\-HORIBA\-IBH joint publication in Meas. Sci. Technol. demonstrated the FLIMera’s capability for real\-time tumour margin estimation, thus bringing FLIM to fluorescence\-guided surgery.

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Co\-founded by David Birch and incorporated in 1977 as a spin\-out from Strathclyde, IBH Ltd was acquired by multinational company HORIBA in 2003 to form HORIBA Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd \(HORIBA\-IBH\), bringing together IBH’s leading technology in pulsed fluorescence lifetime systems and HORIBA steady\-state fluorescence systems to produce a joint product line \[ **S1**\]. The success of the IBH acquisition helped trigger HORIBA’s 2014 acquisition of Photon Technology Inc. David Birch served as IBH Chairman from 1977 to 2003 and subsequently as HORIBA\-IBH Director of Science and Technology. Through this route, the body of research described has: 

-  Expanded the commercial success of HORIBA\-IBH, through new products, improved product performance, and wider application of fluorescence lifetime instrumentation across a number of sectors but particularly in underpinning healthcare 

-  Enabled economic growth, including contributing to HORIBA achieving and maintaining the leading position in the global fluorescence spectroscopy market 

-  Facilitated global multidisciplinary research through enhanced capabilities for users 

-  Supported fluorescence research communities globally, with international training workshops and the founding of a fluorescence journal 

###  Impact 1: New and improved products 

 Strathclyde’s research has been a major influence on HORIBA\-IBH’s product development \[ **S2**\] and has enabled the company to introduce fluorescence products, both optical source components and full systems, utilising semiconductor optical sources that combine lower cost, improved reliability, enhanced repetition rate \(up to 100MHz\) and better spectral coverage than the previously used spark discharge sources. **R1** and **R2**, which described these developments, were noted in world\-leading expert Joseph Lakowicz’s 2006 *Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy \(3<sup>rd</sup> Edition\)* as ‘perhaps the most important development for TCSPC since 2000.’ 

 The *NanoLED* range of sources, with repetition rates up to 1MHz, was introduced from 2000, with the UV version launched in 2004, followed by the *DeltaDiode* range in 2013. At launch, the *DeltaDiode’s* repetition rate of up to 100MHz, combined with pulse durations of \~100\-200ps, was the highest available in the field. Improved time resolution enables lifetimes down to 5ps to be measured with TCSPC \[ **S3**\], facilitating a better understanding of transient dynamics in solids, liquids, colloids and polymers on the nanometre scale. The reduction in timing electronics dead time to 10ns combined with the 100MHz *DeltaDiode* has enabled fluorescence decays to be measured in ms rather than seconds \[ **S3**\], opening up application in the analysis of transient samples. The main commercial and application benefits have been achieved through integration of these semiconductor sources in complete fluorescence lifetime systems such as the present range of *DeltaFlex*, *DeltaPro* and *DeltaTime* dedicated lifetime systems, introduced around 2013 and hybrid lifetime versions of the *Fluorolog* and *FluoroMax* steady\-state fluorimeters \[ **S1**\]. 

 Compared with previous technologies and systems, these products are very user friendly with largely turnkey operation, benefiting from features such as a touchscreen software interface as well as the ease of use and reliability of the semiconductor sources.  This has significantly widened market appeal by attracting non\-specialist users, with HORIBA\-IBH fluorescence products now employed across healthcare, life sciences, pharmaceutical, material sciences, nanotechnology and energy research, in both academic and commercial settings. 

 Recent product development has resulted in a fully integrated spectroscopy\-microscopy laboratory suite incorporating the single\-photon avalanche diode \(SPAD\) fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy \(FLIM\) research described in \[ **R3**\]. *FLIMera*, the HORIBA\-IBH new SPAD FLIM molecular movie camera, launched at Photonics West in February 2020, enables, for the first time, video rate live cell FLIM, benefiting applications such as cancer screening and fluorescence guided surgery. A leading expert in fluorescence from Texas Christian University \(TCU\) has described this work as ‘ground\-breaking …. this new contribution has the potential to revolutionize biomedical imaging, enabling truly live imaging of various cellular processes’ \[ **S4**\]. When awarding the FLIMera its 2019 Business Innovation Award, the Institute of Physics described it as ‘game changing technology’ \[ **S5**\]. 

###  Impact 2: Economic impact, market leading product sales 

 HORIBA\-IBH’s product innovation has led to considerable and ongoing economic success for the business.  Sales figures presented here are obtained from reputable and independent market reports from Strategic Directions International \(SDI\) \[ **S6**\], supplemented by market share information provided by the company \[ **S2**\].  From SDI data on the global fluorescence spectroscopy market \(wider than the lifetime fluorescence market\), HORIBA corporately has the largest market share, growing from 16% of USD152,000,000 i.e. USD24,300,000 \(04\-2013\) in 2013 to a projected 22% of USD186,000,000 i.e. USD40,900,000 \(04\-2020\) in 2020 \(nearest competitor at 13% market share\). Turning to the global lifetime fluorescence segment of the market, this is consistently the fastest growing segment and SDI consistently record HORIBA as the major player in the segment. \[Text removed for publication\] This growth is also evidenced by the HORIBA\-IBH’s annual reports which show net assets growing from GBP465,000 to GBP725,000 over the REF period, a growth of 56% \[ **S7**\]. 

 As a result of sales growth, HORIBA\-IBH, which undertakes all of HORIBA’s lifetime fluorescence product design, manufacturing and sales support functions in Glasgow, moved to new premises, increasing its space in 2015 from 4,800sq ft to 6,660sq ft. \[Text removed for publication\] HORIBA\-IBH is part of HORIBA Scientific which internationally expanded into new premises in New Jersey, USA, in 2018 by 90% to 132,000sq ft. 

###  Impact 3: Facilitating global multidisciplinary research and development 

 HORIBA\-IBH’s market reflects the international nature of the fluorescence spectroscopy market which is approximately evenly split across North America, Europe and Asia with China the fastest growing market \[ **S6**\]. The company has over 1000 customer sites world\-wide which span industry, government laboratories and academia \[ **S2, S4**\] reflecting the market sector breakdown across pharma/biotech \(41%\), applied \(27%\), public sector \(20%\), industrial \(12%\) sectors \[ **S6**\]. Experts in the field and users describe HORIBA\-IBH products as ‘a major leap in technology’ that provide ‘outstanding performance combined with ease of use’ and are ‘used by leading laboratories all over the world’ \[ **S4**\]. 

###  Impact 4: Supporting fluorescence research communities, industrial and academic 

 Strathclyde and HORIBA’s roles at the forefront of the sector have led to a range of activities supporting communications across academia and industry, and providing training to increase fluorescence R&D capacity internationally; these include: 

-  First launched in 2009 and sponsored by HORIBA \(enabling nominal cost or free registration\), FluoroFest is a series of international hands\-on training workshops. Five FluoroFest workshops have taken place around the world since August 2013, consistently attracting around 100 delegates from industry and academia \[ **S2, S8**\]. 

-  A Photophysics CPD course was launched at Czech Technical University, Prague, in 2013, when it ran over 6 days, and rerun in 2017 over 3 days, each with approximately 25 attendees 

-  Institute of Physics Publishing \(IOPP\), launched the journal Methods and Applications in Fluorescence \(MAF\) in 2013, with David Birch as founding co\-editor in chief, a position he still holds. IOPP’s decision to launch the journal was based in part on their strong connection to Strathclyde’s Photophysics Group through the latter’s publications in IOPP journals \[e.g. **R1**, **R2**\]. An associated MAF international conference series, launched biennially in 1989 and annually in 2019, is now the world’s largest fluorescence conference. Both the journal and conference are heavily supported by industry and HORIBA is always a major sponsor.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study concerns the impact of research undertaken by David Albert Jones, Trevor Stammers and Pia Matthews who are members of the Centre for Bioethics and Emerging Technologies \(CBET\). It focuses on the issue of assisted dying, which is a lens for overlapping research on suicide, mental illness, disability, and human dignity as well as research specifically on euthanasia and physician assisted suicide. This research has: Influenced parliamentary debates over the legalisation of assisted dying in the United Kingdom Parliament and the Scottish Parliament; contributed to similar discussions in Germany, Canada, New Zealand and Australia; provided evidence to inform for public debate in the news media; and shaped the resources used by the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales in respect of the issue of ‘dying well’. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Jones was appointed lecturer at St Mary’s in 2002 and Stammers in 2006. In 2008 Jones and Stammers were founder\-members of CBET. Matthews joined CBET in 2009. Jones became director of the Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Oxford in 2010 and was re\-employed by St Mary’s from 2013. Jones, Stammers, and Matthews were included in St Mary’s submission to REF 2014 with Jones submitting a case study. Nevertheless, the present case study is not a “continued case study” as it includes new research since January 2014 and the impact described is distinct. 

 A key strand of the underpinning research is already contained in Jones’s monograph *Approaching the End* \(2007\) \( **3.1**\). Christian theological reflection on death embodies a paradox, in that while the Gospel offers hope of eternal life after death, the Church has consistently opposed the deliberate ending of human life \(with limited exceptions in the context of opposing injustice\). This paradox results from the simultaneous recognition of human life as an inviolable gift of God, to be respected, and of human death as an inherent limit imposed by God, to be accepted. The attempt to end one’s life is not only a failure to respect human life but also a failure to accept death as the limit, or horizon, of human power. 

 The argument made in favour of assisted dying concerns not only the meaning of human death but typically, and often primarily, a characterisation of life with disability and dependence on others as somehow lacking human dignity. Death is imagined to be preferable to life with disability. 

 To challenge this attitude Matthews has written extensively to develop a realistic, yet positive, approach to the consideration of people with disabilities in this discussion. This is informed by her experience as a parent of a daughter with profound, multiple, and complex disabilities. Her monographs *Pope John Paul II and the Apparently ‘Non\-acting’ Person*, \(2013\) \( **3.3**\), and *Discerning Persons Profound Disability, the Early Church Fathers and the Concept of the Person in Bioethics* \(2020\) \( **3.4**\) explore the concepts of person and dignity in the context of profound disability. 

 In November 2014, Jones and Stammers organised a conference on the impact on euthanasia on society, focusing on Belgium. Unable to attend this event but involved in the subsequent publication \( **3.5**\) was Kevin Fitzpatrick, philosopher, activist, and a founding commissioner of the Disability Rights Commission. Jones worked with Fitzpatrick and completed a book chapter by him after he died in 2016. Fitzpatrick argued that a visceral fear of loss of control may be experienced also by those who live successfully with disability. The circumstances of disability, mental illness and impending death are stressors that make people more vulnerable to suicidal thoughts but the challenge to find meaning in life and prevent suicide is one that is common to the human condition and not special to any group. 

 It is noteworthy that neither the practice of euthanasia in the Netherlands and Belgium, nor the practice of assisted suicide in Switzerland, is limited to people who are imminently dying. Euthanasia extends to people with physical disability or mental illness or, in a few cases, even to autism. These practices thus represent an existential threat to people who are disabled. There is also reason to think that acceptance of voluntary euthanasia implies acceptance of non\-voluntary euthanasia \( **3.2**\) and Belgium provides empirical evidence of this logic in practice \( **3.5**\). It is sometimes claimed that the current legal prohibition of assisted suicide may prompt suicide, as people sometimes end their lives earlier while they are still able. However, research by Jones has shown that legalising assisted suicide increases the total number of people dying by their own hand and does not reduce the level of unassisted suicide \( **3.6**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 This research has been cited widely in the public debate concerning the issue of assisted suicide. The reach of the work is illustrated in the mention of it in newspaper coverage, not only in the United Kingdom \( **5.1a**\) but also in Germany, for example in *Frankfurter Allgemeine* Zeitung \( **5.1b**\) and in the United States of America, for example in the *LA Times*, and *Chicago Tribune*, as well as in Australia \( **5.1c\-e**\). 

 **Influence on parliamentary debate regarding assisted dying** 

 More specifically the work of this group has had a discernible impact on parliamentary debates concerning end of life care and assisted dying in several jurisdictions. If maintaining the law against assisted suicide is beneficial then clearly very many people have benefited from the work of Jones and of others at CBET. Furthermore, abstracting from the legislative outcome, the mention of the work of this group in the debate surrounding such legislative discussion has had a beneficial effect on the debate itself, by making high quality empirical evidence available to people. 

 <ins>U</ins><ins>nited Kingdom</ins> 

 During 2014 and 2015, Jones made submissions to the House of Commons Select Committee enquiry on end of life care \( **5.2a**\). He was also invited to give oral evidence by the Ministry of Justice in relation to coroners’ determinations of suicide \( **5.2b\-c**\). Jones contributed further to the debate in England and Wales in 2015 by producing an online guide to the evidence of the impact of assisted dying legislation, which was sent to all MPs \( **5.2d**\). Jones was then invited to address MPs from five political parties in Portcullis House \(Westminster\) prior to the vote \( **5.3**\). On 5 September 2015 Stammers had an article published in the *Spectator* which drew on personal experience, as well as clinical and academic knowledge. On the morning of the vote, Jones had letters published both in *The Independent* and *The Telegraph* arguing, based on his research, against the Bill \( **5.1a**\). The Bill was defeated in the House of Commons on 11 September 2015 by 330 votes to 118.  After the vote, Jones received a letter from Fiona Bruce MP, chair of the all\-party group that was opposing the Bill thanking him for “the important work you did towards the defeat of the Assisted Dying \(No 2\) Bill” \( **5.4**\). 

 <ins>Scotland</ins> 

 On behalf of The Anscombe Bioethics Centre, Jones made a submission to the Health and Sport Committee in relation to the Assisted Suicide \(Scotland\) Bill \( **5.5a**\). Jones presented oral evidence to the Committee in relation to this Bill at the 2nd Meeting, 2015 \(Session 4\), Tuesday 20 January 2015 \( **5.5b**, p.58\). His views were quoted verbatim in the report produced by the Committee on five occasions: on the issue of respect for autonomy \( **5.5b**, p.13\); on withdrawal/refusal of life\-sustaining treatment \( **5.5b**, p.17\); on coercion \( **5.5b**, p.31\); on informing patients of their treatment options \( **5.5b**, p.33\); and on the lack of clarity about the role of facilitators \( **5.5b**, p.39\). The BBC reported that the final view of the Committee was that ‘the bill contained ""significant flaws"" and opposed its general principles’ \( **5.5c**\). The written and oral evidence presented by Jones to the Scottish Health and Sport Committee was quoted in the debate and in the report of that committee \( **5.5d**, p.43 and p.49\). The Assisted Suicide \(Scotland\) Bill was defeated on 27 May 2015 by 82 votes to 36 \( **5.5c**\). 

 <ins>Germany</ins> 

 In a co\-written article, published after the votes in Scotland and England, Jones presented evidence that legalization of assisted dying leads to more people taking their own lives \( **3.6**\). This research was cited twice in the Bundestag debate on assisted suicide on 6 November 2015 \(which voted by 309 votes to 235 to restrict organised forms of assistance in suicide\) \( **5.6**\). 

 <ins>Canada</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>New</ins> <ins>Zealand</ins> <ins>and Australia</ins> 

 In 2015 Jones provided a submission to the External Panel on Options for a Legislative Response to Carter v Canada \( **5.7**\). Jones made written contributions to the Health Select Committee Investigation into Ending One’s Life in New Zealand and to the New Zealand Parliamentary Justice Committee on the End of Life Choice Bill. He was invited to give oral evidence to both committees \( **5.8a**\). While Jones did not engage directly in the debates in Australia, his work \( **3.6**\) was cited in submissions to a parliamentary select committee in Western Australia \( **5.8b**\) and in parliamentary debate in Victoria \( **5.8c**\). 

 In both Canada and New Zealand, Jones’s contributions to consultations were appreciated by official committees of inquiry \( **5.8a**\). However, in both cases a change of government led to the reports of these committees being set aside and new committees being constituted with a strong bias in favour of legalisation. Jones’ work on the connection between the legalisation of physician\-assisted suicide and suicide rates \( **3.6**\) was quoted in the Ministry of Justice Departmental Report of December 2018 \( **5.8d**\). Nevertheless, legislation in Canada was at least restricted to cases where “natural death was reasonably foreseeable” and legislation in New Zealand has been made dependent on the outcome of a referendum.  In both jurisdictions the debate continues. 

 **Shaping Catholic and public discussion of “Dying Well”** 

 The debates in the United Kingdom and internationally placed great weight on the dangers of legalising assisted suicide but they also revealed the need to promote a more positive account of dying well. Since 2007 the Catholic Churches of England and Wales, Scotland and Ireland have celebrated an annual “Day for Life”. In 2015 the theme was “Cherishing Life, Accepting Death” and Jones was involved in drafting the material \( **5.9a**\). This title is taken from previous work on living wills that Jones produced for the Catholic bishops \( **5.9b**, pp.7, 11\-12, 24\-5\). Matthews produced resources for the 2016 and the 2017 Day for Life \( **5.9c\-d**\). The resources produced by Jones and Matthews were distributed to all Catholic parishes in England and Wales \(over 2,500 parishes\) and the theme of the Day for Life was reported widely in the secular and religious media. 

 After the Day for Life 2015, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales decided to support a project to make available online and in a modern form the Catholic tradition of the Art of Dying Well \( *ars moriendi*\). After its launch in November 2016 the project subsequently moved to St Mary’s University. Jones was a member of the reference group for the project from its inception and Matthews was instrumental its coming to St Mary’s.  The project is independent of CBET but collaborates with CBET on events such as *A Graceful Death: an exhibition* by artist Antonia Rolls, which presented portraits of people who were dying alongside poetry selected and read by Stammers. *The Art of Dying Well* has won a Jerusalem Award for one of its podcasts and is available at  [https://www.artofdyingwell.org/](https://www.artofdyingwell.org/) \( **5.10**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Age\-related macular degeneration is a leading cause of blindness, affecting more than 600,000 people in the UK and 200 million globally. Low macular pigment density is a risk factor for the disease, but screening has been hampered by technological limitations. University of Bristol research showed that our ability to see the polarization of light could be used for rapid and non\-invasive assessment of macular pigment density. In 2016, spin\-out company Azul Optics Ltd was formed to develop the product, MP\-eye, and has attracted over \[text removed for publication\] of investment. MP\-eye has sold \[text removed for publication\] across the UK, mainland Europe and Scandinavia, Canada, Australia and the Philippines. MP\-eye improves personalisation of consultations with optometrists and changes individuals’ behaviour to protect their long\-term eye health. Opticians have reported increased sales of sunglasses, supplements and blue filtering lenses. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Polarization is a property of light, like colour and brightness, which can provide distinct and useful information about a visual scene. Many animals use the polarization of light to improve visual contrast and to inform behaviours including navigation and communication. Prof Nicholas Roberts and Dr Shelby Temple, with funding from the BBSRC \[i, ii\], developed a new, real time display\-screen technology for visualizing different polarization images which was used to test how well different species of both invertebrates and vertebrates \(cephalopods, fish and crustaceans\) \[1, 2\] could see the polarization of light. 

 Roberts and Temple realised that the same technology could be extended to test how sensitive humans are at seeing the polarization of light \[2\]. The test was based on “Haidinger’s brushes” – an entopic visual phenomenon that relies on the absorption of light by macular pigments in the eye. They hypothesized that the threshold of being able to see Haidinger’s brushes \(HB\) as the percent of light that was polarized was decreased would relate to the density of macular pigments in the eye. 

 Macular pigments \(MPs\) absorb short\-wavelength \(380–500nm\) visible light and thereby provide protection to the most vulnerable and arguably important region of the retina, the fovea at the centre of the macula. In addition to blue light protection, the macular pigments are antioxidants and neutralize free radicals that are a causative agent for age\-related macular degeneration \(AMD\). Higher levels of MPs reduce later life risks of developing AMD. 

 While working on publication \[2\], Temple made the connection that this technology could be used as a tool to assess an individual’s risk factor for AMD. Follow\-up research funded through a BBSRC Research Grant \[ii\], an associated Impact Acceleration Award \[iii\], and an Innovate UK Innovation to Commercialisation of University Research \(ICURe\) Aid for Start\-Ups Grant \[iv\], uncovered the full details of the relationship between the macular pigment density and our ability to see the polarization of light, proving this was a feasible approach \[3, 4\]. 

 The core technology was patented \[5\], and a company \(Azul Optics Ltd\) was set up and incorporated in August 2016. Independent investment and grant funding were obtained, and over three years the company has developed a product called the MP\-eye. The approach is elegantly simple. Individuals are asked to identify the direction of rotation of HB when presented with a circular stimulus illuminated with an even intensity of polarized white light in which the electric field vector rotates either clockwise or anti\-clockwise. By reducing the degree of polarization of the stimulus light, a threshold for perceiving HB \(degree of polarization threshold\) is determined. Unlike previous methods of assessing macular pigment density, the speed and ease of measurement of degree of polarization threshold makes it well suited for large\-scale screening of macular pigmentation. In 2017, Dr Temple was awarded the BBSRC Innovator of the Year award for his success in translating his research into a transforming commercial entity.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Age\-related macular degeneration \(AMD\) affects more than 600,000 people in the UK alone and is estimated to cost the UK healthcare system GBP1.6 billion annually. This number will rise over the coming years as we all continue to live longer and diets worsen for many. Globally the number affected by AMD is predicted to increase to 288 million by 2040. 

#  Commercialization of a new diagnosis technology 

 Following the application to patent the core technology \[5\], Azul Optics Ltd was set up in August 2016 and, over a three\-year period, a novel diagnostic to assess the amount of macular pigment present in the eye was developed. The device, the MP\-eye, is designed for optometrists and enables them to identify people who are at a current increased risk of AMD. Consequently, customers can be empowered to take preventative actions such as wearing protective eyewear and hats, quitting smoking, improved diet and / or supplements and increased fitness, all of which can reduce the risks of sight loss later in life. MP\-eye was registered with the MHRA as a class 1 medical device in October 2018 \[Ai\]. 

 To date, Azul Optics has attracted total investment of \[text removed for publication\] \[Ai\]. The MP\-eye was shortlisted for the ‘good’ award \(best use of technology for doing good\) in the South West ‘SPARKies’ awards \(2018\) and was a finalist for the ‘Product of the Year’ at the Association of Optometrists \(AOP\) awards \(2020\). 

 In 2018, Azul Optics signed an exclusive UK distribution agreement with BIB Ophthalmic Instruments that increased MP\-eye product reach across the UK \[B\]. Subsequent to this, Azul Optics has started working with distributors across \[text removed for publication\] \[Ai\]. 

#  Improved optometrist service provision 

 Optometrists value the additional service and highlight how ‘ *the technology has really added an extra dimension to our service’* \[C\] *.* Feedback from a number of UK practices confirms the added value to both individual customer consultations: 

-  ‘*a more personalised and individualised consultation to our patients, meaning we can give them advice on what treatments would be best for them. It’s also a really quick test, around a minute long, which benefits both us and the patient’* \[C\]. 

-  *‘Unlike an OCT image or fundus photograph that require me to interpret the output for them, my patients engage with the MP\-eye test and so find it easy to understand their score’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘I had a conversation \[with a younger patient\] about eye disease and preventative care that I would typically have had with someone over 55’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘The MP\-eye is a great piece of new technology that has become a focal point for conversations with our patients about what they can do to maintain good eye health through life’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘The fact that there is a device specifically designed to measure this seems to add weight to the conversations we always used to have anyway. It’s certainly easier for our patients to understand a number on a 1 – 10 scale than the potentially abstract explanation & advice we would have given them in the past, and so responses to macular pigment screening have been overwhelmingly positive’.* \[Hi\]. 

 and the practice: 

-  *‘the practice has significantly improved sales of supplements, blue blocking lenses & sunglasses, leading to a quick return on investment for the MP\-Eye’* \[D\]. 

 Of 432 customers at one practice, 151 \(35%\) scored low on the MP\-eye and, of these, 43 chose to select lenses with increased protection against light damage \(e.g., sunglasses, photochromics and blue filtering lenses\). The effect of this on revenue for the practice is in the order of GBP1,500 per month. This increase in sales not only improves protection and benefits the eye health of customers, but also increases positive cash flow for optometrists who are able to sell protective products to customers \[Aii\]. 

#  Change in consumer behaviour to improve eye health and ageing outcomes 

 Feedback from a practice in Northampton, reports nearly 2,000 people in about 1 year had been tested with their MP\-eye system. Based on the availability of MP\-eye \[text removed for publication\], nearly 20,000 people have been screened in the UK. Global figures, \[text removed for publication\], would put this number at over 50,000, of whom 30% who would have scored low, have consequently been given advice about how they can make lifestyle changes to decrease their risk of developing AMD. CEO of Distributor BIB Ophthalmic Instruments commented on the positive feedback from eye care professionals who report that ‘ *the MP\-eye has encouraged patients to take action on what they can do to protect their long\-term eye health*’ \[Bi\]. 

 Data collected by Azul Optics \[text removed for publication\], to understand customer behaviour, has shown that the score an individual receives from the MP\-eye assessment is associated with purchases of protective products. 78% of people that scored very low \(1, blue test\) bought protective products. This decreased to 43% of people that scored low \(1 to 3, white test\) and 17% of people that scored med \(4 to 6\), while 0% of people that scored high \(7\-10\) bought protective products \[Hii\]. 

 Macular pigments can only be obtained from our diet. To maintain healthy macular pigment levels, people must eat a diet high in lutein and zeaxanthin, which can be obtained from foods such as kale, spinach, red and yellow peppers, corn and various other dark and brightly coloured fruits and vegetables. Many people do not eat enough of these foods and/or spend too much time in sunlight or using up their macular pigments through poor lifestyle choices such as smoking and unhealthy food items. 

-  *‘it has encouraged better buying decisions from some of our patients with respect to macular supplements, blue\-protective lenses, Transitions & sunspecs’* \[Hi\]. 

-  *‘a female patient, aged 60 who has some drusen in her periphery, scored very low initially. I provided recommendations, including supplements, and 6 months later during the next check\-up, the same patient measured had substantially increased. This is a great outcome for the patient’* \[E\]. 

-  *‘I \[tested\] a mother and her son….last year and she said, oh I’m sure he’ll be brilliant because he’s always quicker than me... We weren’t busy so I said well let him have a go, and he scored really badly and she was quite shocked. Then opening the discussion we talked about his diet and she said he will not eat any fruit and vegetables. So since then she’s been in and she said he’ll let her make him kale and blueberry smoothy now. He’s having it for breakfast because he wants to beat her*.’ \[F\]. 

 Data collected by Azul Optics from their customers shows a 70% increase in sunglasses sales, a 100% increase in supplement sales and 200% increase in customers choosing blue filtering lenses creating a return in investment in 6\-7 months \[E\]. 

 A practice in Northamptonshire teamed up with their local association for the blind during National Eye Health Week to offer free drop in assessments using the MP\-eye, aimed at people who don’t get their eyes examined regularly. The Marketing and Fundraising Manager for the charity explained that *‘By taking these readings now we can hopefully spot the signs of potential problems at an early stage and recommend ways of improving eye health.’* \[I\]. 

#  Improved practitioner and public understanding of blue light risks 

 Many people are aware of the risks of UV light but often fail to realise that blue light is another wavelength in the light spectrum that can be dangerous for eye health. Dr Temple has given talks and interviews for both practitioners \(e.g., Association of Optometrists \(AOP\)\) and the public on the subject of blue light \[G\]. A recent webinar for Thea, a global pharmaceutical company, attracted 800 participants from their customer base and approximately 250 participants viewed a further webinar hosted by Azul Optics themselves \[Giii\]. Dr Temple has since been asked to provide scientific content on the blue light, reactive oxygen species and macular pigment topic to \[text removed for publication\] \[A\]. Feedback from an optometrist working with \[text removed for publication\] highlighted the benefit for his practice; *‘it has improved my team’s understanding of – and confidence in discussing – the blue light hazard’* \[Hi\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Blood transfusions save millions of lives every year around the world. But the evidence\-base for the safety and efficiency of blood donation and transfusion has remained weak and underdeveloped, risking harm and waste. University of Cambridge collaborative research has addressed this challenge through innovative studies identifying how frequently blood can safely be given, how to ensure people do not proceed to give blood when their iron stores are too low, how to improve organisation of blood donation services, and how to avoid adverse events associated with transfusion. Findings have changed policies and practices in the UK, USA, Canada, and the Netherlands, contributing to improvements in blood supply, prevention of anaemia, and efficiency of blood services. The research has also enabled more personalised matching of donated blood with recipients’ immune profiles to find more and better matches and reduce serious reactions. By decreasing harms and risks, and by improving services, this research has delivered benefits for donors, patients, blood services, and health systems on a large scale.

 Blood donation and transfusion: life\-saving interventions 

 Globally, around 100 million blood transfusions happen every year, saving many lives and promoting recovery from trauma, surgery, cancer, anaemia, haemophilia and many other conditions \(WHO statistics\). Although blood donation and transfusion have been practised for more than a century, a weak evidence base has led to major uncertainties and variations in key practices around the world. Specific uncertainties have persisted about how frequently donors can safely give blood, how to ensure donors are not bled when they are at risk of anaemia, how to encourage people to keep donation appointments, and how to avoid harmful sensitisation of recipients to donor blood. 

 Cambridge\-led collaborative research has addressed these and other important practical issues, often for the first time, in rigorous large\-scale studies. It has done this in close partnership with NHS Blood and Transplant \(NHSBT, the national blood service of England\), other national blood services, blood donors and recipients, and other researchers. 

 How often can people safely give blood? The INTERVAL trial and extension study 

 The Cambridge\-led INTERVAL study, undertaken with NHSBT and Oxford University researchers, was the first\-ever individually randomised controlled trial to examine the frequency of blood donation on donor health and blood supply \[1\]. Between 2012 and 2014, INTERVAL recruited around 45,000 blood donors in England. Men were randomly assigned to give blood at three different intervals of frequency: 8, 10 or 12 weeks between each donation. Women were randomly allocated to give blood at 12\-, 14\- or 16\-week intervals. All participants were initially followed up for two years. An extension study, involving participants who agreed to continue trial participation on their originally allocated intervals for four years of follow\-up, allowed assessment of the longer\-term effects \[2\]. 

 The trial found that the most frequent interval \(every eight weeks for men and every 12 weeks for women\) was associated with more blood being donated: 33% more for men and 24% more for women, compared with the least frequent interval. Increasing blood supply through more frequent donation did not appear to have any major negative effects for donors. But there were some minor unwanted consequences, with increased frequency of donation associated with increased feelings of faintness and tiredness \[1\]. An important finding of the trial was that **donating blood more frequently was more likely to deplete donors’ iron stores and to result in more deferrals of donation for low haemoglobin** \(where donors show up to give blood but cannot do so because their iron stores are too low\) \[1\]. 

 The extension study confirmed that more frequent donation can be maintained over a four\-year period without causing major harm to donor health, but it **also showed iron depletion became more pronounced over time** \[2\]. The study included an evaluation of an intensive reminder approach, finding that it encourages donors to keep blood donation appointments and results in more blood being collected \[2\]. 

 Identifying the best way to do pre\-donation screening to prevent inappropriate bleeding of people with low iron stores: the COMPARE study 

 INTERVAL showed that **around 10% of blood donors were being inappropriately bled**: they were found to have a haemoglobin concentration \(an indicator of iron stores\) below the legal requirements specified by the Blood Safety Quality Regulations. This was happening even though these donors had passed in\-session pre\-donation screening tests \[1,2\]. It meant that then\-current screening processes were not good enough at detecting low iron stores, increasing the risks that some donors might develop anaemia after giving blood. 

 To address this problem, the Cambridge\-led COMPARE study \(2016\-2017\) was undertaken with NHSBT and others. The largest\-ever diagnostic accuracy study in blood donation, it compared four rapid field methods to test for haemoglobin levels with a gold standard laboratory method in over 21,000 donors \[3\]. Using a scorecard of outcomes that assessed accuracy, feasibility, donor acceptability, and cost, the study judged the best approach to be **a simple finger\-prick method**. It outperformed newer \(and more costly\) methods, including a non\-invasive light\-shining spectrometry method that was being adopted at that time by several European countries \[3\]. 

 Enhancing compatibility between recipient blood and donor blood to prevent serious reactions through low\-cost, scalable genotype matching 

 Ensuring immuno\-compatibility between recipient and donor is essential to prevent serious reactions after blood transfusions, including sensitisation. It is, however, typically done using crude methods based on simple blood\-type matching, with the result that around 500,000 recipients annually experience harm through sensitisation. Sensitisation results in a lifetime risk of haemolytic transfusion reactions, responsible for about 15% of deaths associated with blood transfusions, and renders transfusion\-dependent patients un\-transfusable. 

 Cambridge researchers, working with Dutch and American blood services, have developed and validated a novel genotyping platform for blood donors \[4,5\]. A pragmatic low\-cost technology \(<GBP20 per sample\), it enables large\-scale screening of dozens of red blood cell and other antigens to match donations with the immune profiles of recipients. The research found **that the likelihood of finding a compatible donor is substantially increased when genotyping is used**, compared with standard methods \[4,5\].

 Improving the safety and efficiency of blood donation and transfusion: a global challenge 

 Donated blood is a crucial resource for healthcare systems, enabling life\-saving transfusions. Though blood donation has been practised for over a century, and takes place on a massive scale – over 100 million donations annually worldwide, including 1.4 million in the UK \(NHSBT statistics\) – many basic questions relevant to safety and efficiency have not been answered. This has resulted in unwarranted variation in policies and practices that pose potential threats to people’s health and to the sustainability of blood services \( *Lancet* 2013\). Noting this deficit in knowledge, the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) wrote in 2014: “ *Donor health is a new area of research \[…\] that has been neglected by the international research community”* \[A\]. 

 New evidence\-base and long\-term infrastructures to inform life\-saving blood donation and transfusion practices 

 University of Cambridge\-led collaborative efforts to address the problems of the weak evidence\-base for blood donation safety and efficiency have powerfully influenced blood donation services in the UK and internationally. In 2015, the UK’s first standalone research unit on blood donation was established at Cambridge, in partnership with NHSBT, Oxford University and the Wellcome Sanger Institute: the NIHR Blood and Transplant Research Unit in Donor Health and Genomics \[B\]. In 2017, the UK’s first\-ever Professorship of Blood Donor Health was established at the University of Cambridge \(with Professor Di Angelantonio appointed the Foundation Chair\), in partnership with NHSBT \[C\]. 

 These novel infrastructures have enabled rapid translation of Cambridge\-led research into new policies and practices through close collaboration with NHSBT, active engagement with policy\-makers, and focus on coproducing studies to answer the most pressing questions and achieve shared goals. Studies are developed and delivered jointly to provide actionable, practical findings that directly benefit donors, recipients, blood services, and health systems. Research findings are presented regularly to NHSBT’s senior leadership team and the **UK Blood Services Standing Advisory Committee on the Care and Selection of Donors**, which advises the Joint United Kingdom Blood Transfusion and Tissue Transplantation Services Professional Advisory Committee on guidelines for the care and selection of whole blood and component donors \[D\]. This close relationship ensures that the research rapidly effects change on a large scale. 

 Impact on improving the safety of blood donation 

 Awarded ‘Best Publication of the Year’ in 2018 by the NHSBT Research & Development Awards \[E\], the INTERVAL trial \[1,2\] resolved longstanding policy debates about how frequently blood can safely be given. Recognising that more frequent donation can have unwanted effects, **Cambridge evidence now underpins NHSBT’s policy of a normal maximum donation frequency** of every 12 weeks for men and every 16 weeks for women \[D\]. 

 Evidence from the INTERVAL studies has also encouraged adoption of new safety\-oriented policies internationally. For example, supported by the findings of INTERVAL, **Canadian Blood Services have now increased the minimum inter\-donation interval in females from 8 to 12 weeks and require donors to have higher haemoglobin before donation** to prevent inappropriate bleeding of people with low iron stores \[F\]. These changes reflect recognition of the INTERVAL studies as providing *“very convincing data about the importance of the minimum inter donation interval on donor iron status and Hb levels”* \[F\]. 

 The Canadian Blood Services Chief Scientist reports that such policy changes resulted *“in cost savings for the organization and a better donation experience for female donors”*, and *“\[are\] our first steps toward helping our donors do a better job of iron maintenance”* \[F\]. The number of people attending donation sessions in Canada and found to have low iron stores has **decreased by over a quarter \(27%\)** in both women and men since 2017 \[G\], indicating improved safety. 

 Evidence from the COMPARE study has been key to reducing rates of anaemia among blood donors by convincing NHSBT to introduce a new approach to pre\-donation screening of donor haemoglobin across the entire English national blood service in 2018 \[H\]. Following presentations and written submissions to the NHSBT Board by Professor Di Angelantonio in 2017 \(later published in a scientific paper \[3\]\), NHSBT acted swiftly on the study’s key recommendation to replace the existing venous blood test with the finger\-prick test that the study found to be more accurate \[I\]. As a direct result of this change, about 100 blood donors each day – around 30,000 every year – are estimated to be saved from avoidable anaemia and potential iron deficiency \[D\]. As iron deficiency can cause symptoms such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and palpitations, these are significant benefits for donors – who generously give blood to help others. 

 A further related impact of this research has been **avoiding potential reputational and financial damage to blood services in England**. This could have arisen if NHSBT had gone ahead, without evaluation, with adopting non\-invasive light\-shining methods to screen haemoglobin levels of donors. These methods were introduced in blood services in countries including Ireland, Spain, and Bavaria. But they were later found to perform poorly, leading hundreds of donors to develop avoidable anaemia by being bled when their iron stores were low. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service, for example, had to suspend blood donations for a period. The service had to pay for affected donors’ medical tests and treatment, faced legal action, and provided financial compensation \[J\]. Its medical and scientific director described the situation as “ *a ‘never event’ and we were very distressed by it*” \[J\]. 

 The evidence from COMPARE guided NHSBT to avoid spectrometry methods, showing that these methods did not offer sufficient accuracy, especially for people of different ethnicities and skin colour types, and were unsuitable for blood services in countries with a large and ethnically diverse pool of donors such as the UK \[3\]. 

 Impact on the efficiency of blood collection 

 The INTERVAL extension study \[2\] showed that an intensive, pragmatic approach combining text and telephone messages to remind donors of their appointments improved the efficiency of blood collection compared with the then\-standard NHSBT protocol. Because people were more likely to keep their appointments, this strategy led to a mean increase of 0.11 units of blood collected per year from men, and 0.06 units from women. At scale, these improvements translate into around 40,000 extra litres – or 75,000 extra potential units \(a unit of blood costs about GBP120\) – collected from the current donor base in England of approximately 900,000 people \[1,2\], with associated benefits for NHSBT and the economy. 

 The findings led NHSBT to adopt, in 2016, the trial’s comprehensive multi\-modal reminder process to help donors make and keep appointments. It has been well received by donors, whose ratings of their experience are at their highest level for five years \[D\]. 

 Impact on the safety of blood transfusion 

 Global common practice is to match blood only for the ABO and RhD blood groups, even though the imprecision in this approach results each year in an estimated 500,000 patients worldwide becoming sensitised by forming antibodies. Sensitisation is a very bad outcome: it can mean transfusion\-dependent people cannot be transfused, and it increases risks of haemolytic transfusion reactions, which are responsible for about 15% of deaths associated with blood transfusions \(US Food and Drug Administration statistics\). In pregnancy, sensitisation may lead to potentially life\-threatening haemolytic disease of the fetus or newborn infant. Until now, however, better matching has been challenging due to the cost and difficulty of more precise donor typing. 

 Cambridge’s work with blood services in the Netherlands and USA has resulted in a validated, low\-cost genotyping technology for blood groups that can be used routinely \[4,5\]. Its distinctive strength is that it enables more precise, reliable and personalised matching of the available blood to the immune profile of the recipient. This application of genomics\-based transfusion medicine \[5\] **reduces risk to donation recipients, allows patients at risk of adverse reactions to be transfused, and increases the likelihood of finding suitable donor blood**. 

 Using this approach, blood services have identified two\-to\-three times more compatible donors for particularly at\-risk patients, and have been able to identify at least one match for hundreds of individuals for whom previously no match could be found from the same donors using cruder methods \[5\]. The New York Blood Center, which serves communities of more than 75 million people and over 500 hospitals across the United States, has changed its investment decisions and strategy accordingly. *“Because we are the leader in the U.S. of genomic testing for transfusion offering testing for other blood centers across the country, your studies impact practice in all of the U.S to provide immediate clinical benefit. You have shown that genomic approaches will fundamentally change the way donors are recruited, units are stored, and products are selected for transfusion”* \[K\]. 

 Already, lives are being saved as a consequence of the platform’s development, with even greater potential to make transfusion safer in the future. For example, the Cambridge\-devised technology was used to provide life\-saving transfusion to a 24\-year old Dutch patient with a serious condition who required blood with a rare profile possessed by only 1 in 400 donors. By using genotyping results generated by the platform, five compatible active donors were identified \[L\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Inspired by Dame Professor Carol Ann Duffy’s Laureateship, poets in the Manchester Writing School \(MWS\) have led the revival of poetry in the UK as a public medium informed by a mission for equality, social justice and cultural enfranchisement. MWS poets have extended the reach and significance of contemporary poetry by engaging new audiences that include broadcast audience figures alone of over 52,000,000 since 2014, plus multiple engagements via print, online and live events. They have introduced a literary form often seen as marginal into prominent cultural spaces hitherto dominated by prose, including theatre, radio, television, concert halls and community projects. MWS poets have catalysed debates and altered perceptions of pressing social, environmental and political concerns. They have successfully re\-presented canonical texts to address contemporary issues, and have influenced perceptions of the role of poetry in public discourse.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since the establishment of the Manchester Writing School at the university in 1998, the Poetry Research Group has built an international reputation for actively engaged, powerful contemporary public poetry in a wide range of cultural forms and domains. Through its work, contemporary poetry has been remobilised as a medium that inspires people and prompts them into reflection and action. The current Writing School, including poets such as Carol Ann Duffy, Michael Symmons Roberts, Jean Sprackland, Adam O’Riordan, Andrew McMillan, Helen Mort and Karen Solie, builds on the legacy of former colleagues, including Simon Armitage, Jeffrey Wainwright and Michael Schmidt. 

 Though formally and thematically diverse in their practice, these writers are united by their shared communal ethos and orientation, and their passionate commitment to a tradition of public and often collaborative work in English poetry that manifests itself in elegies, commissioned commemorations and political poems. The poets’ work in this tradition is recognised by their public prominence, and their publications on major trade poetry lists: Roberts, Sprackland and McMillan with Cape, Duffy and Solie with Picador, and Mort and O’Riordan with Chatto & Windus— all publishing houses committed to disseminating poetry among wide audiences. The capacity for contemporary poetry to function as a transformative public art is further evidenced by the ways in which these poets have responded to high\-profile commissions. For example, Duffy’s employment of British demotic speech in verse forms on the page has led to work such as her ground\-breaking contemporary political reimagining of *Everyman* for the National Theatre **\[1\].** Roberts’ employment of half\-rhymed couplets to carry contemporary dialogue and narrative has been developed through more than two decades of work on libretti and broadcast plays, culminating in his acclaimed verse drama for BBC Radio and Television about homelessness, *Men Who Sleep in Cars* **\[2\].** Duffy’s work as Britain’s first female Poet Laureate and most prominent writer of commissioned public poetry—such as her acclaimed elegy *The Last Post*, marking the deaths of the last two British soldiers to fight in the First World War—exemplifies MWS poets’ commitment to poetry as a public art form that can challenge and change perspectives on a wide range of social and political issues **\[3\].** This radical commitment to taking poetry ‘beyond the page’ includes McMillan’s powerful writing on homosexuality and the male body **\[4\],** Mort’s recasting of mountaineering as a feminist act **\[5\]** and Sprackland’s passionate evocation of the ecological crisis in her poetry collections and creative nonfiction **\[6\].** All these poets have reached new audiences through broadcast, stage performance and collaboration.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Generating new audiences for canonical poetic texts addressing contemporary issues** 

 Building on their work addressing social and political issues, the poets in the Manchester Writing School are regularly commissioned to adapt and dramatize canonical poetic texts to resonate with contemporary cultural and political questions. Duffy’s re\-telling of the fifteenth\-century English morality play *Everyman* for the National Theatre \(2015\) placed the drama firmly in the context of our contemporary eco\-crisis, recasting Everyman’s sin as indifference to the earth’s future. The play reached 6,266,762 people, including live theatre audiences, cinema\-streamed audiences, radio listeners and YouTube viewers. *Everyman* also attracted younger and more diverse audiences, with increased representation from BAME communities and people with disabilities. It was acclaimed for its contemporary relevance: Michael Billington argued in *The Guardian* that its ‘big achievement’ was ‘to keep the framework of the original while suiting the content to a secular society’ \(30.04.15\) **\[A\].** Roberts’ 2018 dramatisation of Milton’s *Paradise Lost* for BBC Radio 4, starring Sir Ian McKellen, was released as a commercial audiobook by Penguin. This verse drama introduced new listeners to Milton’s world torn apart by the civil war, drawing poignant contemporary parallels with divided Britain during the Brexit process. *The Spectator* declared that it felt ‘very much in tune with our own obsessive fears’ \(31.03.18\), and a review in the *New Statesman* announced that ‘never was a poem so needed’ \(22.03.18\). Roberts is committed to this ‘opening up’ of classic poetic texts: his projects also included a re\-telling of Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s radical feminist verse novel *Aurora Leigh* \(BBC R4, 04.02.17\), and a re\-mapping of T. S. Coleridge’s ‘Kubla Khan’ onto the Trafford Centre, Greater Manchester’s iconic shopping mall \(BBC R4, 30.12.17\). These programmes have increased the cultural capital of new audiences, informing them of not just what these texts engage with, but also why they continue to be relevant. The contemporary adaptation becomes a means for making these texts work to express or explore these audiences’ own pressing issues and concerns. Again, in the hands of the Manchester Writing School poets, poetry manifests itself as a powerful tool for democratic self\-enfranchisement and emancipation **\[B\].** 

 **Challenging and changing perceptions of social and political issues** 

 The Manchester Writing School’s work reaches beyond poetry book readerships, and utilises wider public contexts including broadcast media, theatre, music and commemoration. As a result, they have been able to reach, inspire and mobilise new audiences, whose identities and voices have become a more established presence within these domains of public discourse. This process has afforded the poets an influential voice in debates on a range of social, political and environmental issues. Roberts’ Radio 4 and BBC4 TV verse drama *Men Who Sleep in Cars* \(05.02.15\), starring Maxine Peake, was widely critically acclaimed: *The Observer* declared it ‘a work of genius’ \(01.10.17\), and it was nominated for the UK Broadcast Awards and RTS Awards in 2018. The broadcasts achieved over 1 million engagements, raising awareness of this under\-reported kind of ‘hidden homelessness’, prevalent in young and middle\-aged men. Wide media \(and social media\) responses to the issues raised in the drama included a live national broadcast debate on BBC 5\-Live’s *Afternoon Edition* addressing the relationship between homelessness and shame, and a feature in the *Manchester Evening News* \(30.09.17\), in which Maxine Peake used her role in the film to issue a call to action on the city’s ‘homelessness explosion’: ‘we have to show a bit of compassion and interest \[…\] we’re only a pay packet away’ **\[C\].** Mort’s retelling of the Medusa myth for Proper Job Theatre’s touring play reached 77,000 people. Again, the play attracted new and younger audiences from the northwest, increased awareness of sexual abuse, and gave voice to victims. It also made a positive impact on the production company and touring venues, diversifying and broadening audiences, and increasing media coverage **.** McMillan’s assertive invocations of sexuality and masculinity in his published poetry have informed his work with LGBT communities. Poem\-lyrics for LGBT choir The Sunday Boys were created through focus\-group discussions, and performed at Manchester’s Stoller Hall \(29.7.18\), reaching audiences of 3,383. His work affords new, young, male and northwest audiences’ access to contemporary poetry as a means of intervening in public discourse. McMillan fostered a local sense of community, bridged intergenerational divides, increased the pride and confidence of choir members, and bolstered the choir’s aspiration and ambition **\[D\].** 

 **Helping wide audiences to mark major commemorations and celebrations** 

 The poets’ own broadcast poetry, and their adaptations of classic poetic texts, have achieved a minimum of 52,141,311 audience engagements since 2014. Their work has increased the share of male listeners aged 15\-24 by 57%; male listeners aged 35\-44 by 31%; and total listeners aged 35\-44 by 36%, compared to regular poetry audiences on the radio **\[E\].** This track record has led to many new commissions designed to mark public anniversaries and events. Duffy’s ‘The Wound in Time’, commissioned by director Danny Boyle and 14\-18 Now, was recited on beaches across the UK as a nationwide act of remembrance for the Armistice Centenary \(11.11.18\), and was broadcast on BBC Radio 4, reaching an estimated 3.5 million audience engagements. It generated new audiences for poetry, increasing reach with young people, males and lower socio\-economic groups. ‘The Wound in Time’ united people in a national act of remembrance at a fractious time in our recent history during the Brexit process, connecting people with their past and with each other **\[F\]**. Roberts’ collaborative and multi\-media Somme commemoration in Manchester Cathedral \(‘Manchester Hill Remembered’\) reached a live audience of 1,069 people, with an increased reach in northwest and younger audiences. The performance increased awareness of this important event in Mancunian history: 63% of the audience had not heard of Manchester Hill prior to the event **\[G\]**. McMillan’s ‘Conversations on a Bench’ for BBC Radio 4 deployed verbatim interview material interwoven with poetry to create an elegy for the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing \(29.08.17\). As the social media reaction indicated, the programme enabled people to articulate their grief **\[H\].** Roberts was also commissioned by Manchester International Festival and the BBC Philharmonic to produce a choral oratorio with composer Emily Howard \( *The Anvil*\) to commemorate the Peterloo Massacre on its bicentenary in 2019. *The Anvil* shed new light on this seminal historical\-political anniversary. Premiered to a live audience of 1,300 at Bridgewater Hall \(7.7.19\), it was the centrepiece of a range of Peterloo\-themed events based on Roberts’ texts for *The Anvil*, performed by \(among others\) the Irish immersive theatre group Anu in sites around Manchester, reaching a total live audience for the day of 4,200. The concert was also broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on the anniversary of Peterloo \(16.8.19\) **\[I\].** 

 **Re\-energising poetry’s role in society** 

 Through its work ‘beyond the page’, Manchester Writing School has been at the forefront of challenging perceptions of poetry as a marginal and arcane literary form. Through a strategy of free access and a programme of public outreach, Sprackland’s work as Chair of the online Poetry Archive since 2016 has developed new global audiences for poets reading their own poems. In 2018\-19, there were 1,262,510 engagements with the Poetry Archive from across the world. A sample of 530,000 users broken down by age showed 145,000 in the 18\-24 group, signalling significant reach with younger people. User feedback emphasised that the archive allows ‘Easy access to magnificent recordings to use in my classroom with the educational resources’, and it ‘enables my students to connect the written word, the spoken word, and the history and context in which the words were created’. There are over 200,000 engagements with the Poetry Archive every month **\[J\].** Roberts’ essays for BBC Radio 4’s strand *Something Understood* explored ideas ranging from cultural understanding of death to the power of pervasive bodily metaphors \(breath, heart, vision\) in our culture. Roberts has used this platform to introduce audiences to poems by a wide range of contemporary poets. Building on its tradition of ‘widening access’ to poetry, our university has invested in a specialist Poetry Library, which is the first one to be built in England since 1968, and the first public poetry library ever to be established in a UK university. The library will provide a focus for events, engagement and residencies for the city of Manchester, the north\-west and its diverse poetic communities, plus readers and performers from the UK and abroad. The Library will function as a natural, but hugely significant, development of the MWS poets’ commitment to generate new audiences through public poetry.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Natural capital and the multiple ecosystem services derived from it are the essential basis of all life on Earth. Drawing on pioneering interdisciplinary research conducted over many decades, our School has: established the foundational principles of ecosystem assessment knowledge; refined them in international knowledge exchange platforms to impact, most notably, the *UN Convention on Biodiversity*; and translated them into UK\-wide policy practices in Whitehall and wider civil society. Impact has been repeatedly achieved by exercising leadership via pathways such as *DEFRA* and the *UNs Intergovernmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,* and by making influential contributions to the *UK Natural Capital Committee* and HM Treasury’s *Dasgupta Review on the Economics of Biodiversity*. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 **Fundamental research insights** 

 All human wellbeing and economic activity in the world is ultimately dependent upon the natural environment and the ‘ecosystem services’ it provides. Our research, published in some of the most highly cited journals, has, since 2000, successfully derived five fundamentally important research insights that are interconnected: 

-  There are *many interrelated types of natural capital*. The conceptual work of **Turner** and **Watson \[R1, R2\]** has defined these types more precisely, by developing a well\-used classification scheme **\[R3\]**. This work has demonstrated that the diversity of these basic types, and the services that flow from each type, require inter\-disciplinary approaches to research, knowledge exchange and refinement, and policy Impact **\[R1, R2\]**. It has confirmed that there is unlikely to be a single classification scheme that is adequate for all ecosystems and policy\-making contexts, hence demonstrating a policy demand for tailored, i.e. culturally attuned, knowledge \(see Insight 5, below\). 

-  *Implementing principles* are necessary in order to move from these basic types to achieving policy change and other Impacts such as new practitioner understandings and business practices. These include being clear about the timing and location of ecosystem changes and the value of any resulting societal impacts **\[R3, R4\]**. Crucially, **Watson’s** research **\[R2, R4\]** also powerfully underlined the importance of a new implementing principle – the need to include ‘nature’s contributions to people’ as well as planetary health **\[R4\]**. 

-  *A decision support toolbox* is needed to translate ecosystem knowledge into Impact, such as economic valuation techniques, natural capital asset checks, ‘ecosystems at risk’ registers, computer\-based models and more qualitative\-deliberative assessment tools. **Turner** and **Ferrini** developed a new ‘Balance Sheet Approach’ which combines traditional national income accounts data with fresh, ecosystem\-specific data **\[R1, R3\]**. These and other tools were originally introduced via academic publications **\[R5, R6\]**, subsequently refined in knowledge translation platforms and then published in policy reports \(see below\). 

-  *New, more policy\-relevant data is required to inform specific decision tools used within government, such as policy appraisal*. Through the work of **Bateman, Lovett** and **Day**, novel combinations of data and tools were trialled and implemented, e.g. using the platform of geographical information systems to reveal the spatial variability of ecosystems and therefore of ecosystem services **\[R1, R3, R6\]**. Crucially, our research powerfully underlined the fact that different types of data \(ecological, economic, cultural\) are required to answer different policy questions, e.g., in relation to current ecosystem change vs. future ecosystem change. It also confirmed that particular attention should also be afforded to ecosystems \(and ecosystem services\) which exhibit thresholds below which restoration is difficult or even impossible \(so\-called ‘critical natural capital’\) **\[R7, R8\]**. 

-  *New classifications, tools and data are only ever a necessary but insufficient condition for generating long term Impact*. Original research must first be translated into usable policy relevant knowledge via ongoing dialogues with relevant stakeholders in knowledge exchange platforms that are widely perceived to have credibility and legitimacy. Our Impact work has shown that knowledge translation requires patience, trust and political sensitivity. By working closely with key stakeholders such as *DEFRA* **\[S1\]** and the *UN* **\[S2\]** over long periods of time, our researchers have repeatedly satisfied these requirements, to inform new policy objectives and specific policy instruments such as regulation and taxation. 

 **Knowledge translation and refinement** 

 Directly informed by Insight 5, these insights were extensively refined through discussion with stakeholders in knowledge exchange platforms *,* starting with the 2011 *UK National Ecosystem Assessment* \(NEA\). This platform was actually co\-led by **Watson** in his role as Chief Scientist in *DEFRA*. The *NEA* was the first national ecosystem assessment in the world and was timed to coincide with \(and directly inform\) the launch of the Government’s 2011 *White Paper on the Natural Environment*. **Bateman** and **Turner** were among several of our staff who served on the *NEA’s* Expert Panel. **Bateman** authored its conceptual framework \(drawing on Insight 1\) and lead authored the main keystone chapters. At the launch, the then Secretary of State \(Caroline Spelman\) said the *NEA* was a *“vital step forward in our ability to understand the true value of nature”* \(quote from BBC News website, ‘Nature is ‘worth billions’ to UK’, 1 June 2011\). A subsequent *OECD* analysis identified it as an international best practice example of how to refine scientific research for enduring Impact.

 4. Details of the Impact 

 Conserving and enhancing nature are integral to the UN biodiversity convention’s Aichi targets and the EU’s 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> Environmental Action Programmes. Yet such targets have been repeatedly missed in the past. Our five research insights \(see Section 2\) have demonstrated that this is because natural capital \(and the services it generates\) is thought about too narrowly \(Insight 1\), that relevant knowledge is not adequately refined for policy Impact \(Insight 2\) and, consequently, ecosystems are systematically undervalued in contemporary policy analysis and decision making \(Insights 3,4,5\). Our five insights led the way in remedying this situation by significantly shaping both UK Government and international thinking on biodiversity, natural capital, and ecosystem conservation. These changes in thinking have, in turn, led directly to policy Impact, with multiple benefits for the environment, society and the economy. 

 **National level Impact and leadership** 

 Following the success of the *NEA* in 2011 \(see Section 2\), *DEFRA* launched a *National Ecosystem Assessment Follow\-on* \(NEAFO\) in June 2014 **\[S1\]**, its entire *raison d’être* being to translate the findings of the *NEA* into lasting Impacts across Whitehall and wider civil society. The *NEAFO*, co\-chaired by **Turner** and **Watson,** had three principal aims **\[S1**, page 6\]: to “\(1\) further understanding of the economic and social value of nature; \(2\) to develop tools and products to operationalise the Ecosystem Approach; and \(3\) to support the inclusion of natural capital in the UK’s National Accounts.” Our Insight 5 directly informed *DEFRA’s* decision to appoint **Turner** \(an environmental economist\) to integrate social science thinking into its thinking and, through the work of **Jordan**, onwards into systems of government policy appraisal and land use planning \(Insight 3\). **Bateman** and **Turner** were directly responsible for producing *NEAFO’s* conceptual framework \[published as **R5\] \[S1**, page 12\]; **Bateman** and **Day** produced the central economic model underpinning the entire assessment **\[S3\]**; and **Bateman, Day, Anger\-Kraavi, Turner** and **Jordan** all led or co\-led pivotal work packages \(thus exemplifying the importance of Insight 5\). 

 A second direct outcome of the *NEA* was the development of the *Treasury*/ *DEFRA* *Natural Capital Committee* \(NCC\), established in 2012 to provide expert advice to HM Government. According to *DEFRA*, **Bateman** quickly emerged as an especially influential committee member, drawing directly on his *NEA* and *NEAFO* work **\[S4, S5\]**. The *NCC* subsequently produced annual state of natural capital reports \(thus acting in response to Insight 4\) and advised on many other strategic and operational matters \(e.g. corporate accounting, cost benefit analysis and long\-term policy planning\). 

 A third direct outcome was the Treasury’s 2019 decision to establish the *Global \(‘Dasgupta’\) Review on the Economics of Biodiversity* **\[S6\]** which reported jointly to the Prime Minister and Chancellor. **Watson** was a founding member of the *Dasgupta Review* group, and according to the Deputy Head of National Biodiversity at DEFRA “ **UEA** \[staff\] continue to be involved in key ground\-breaking research including the \[Dasgupta review\]. It is expected that this review will draw on the National Ecosystem Assessment \(and Follow\-On\) reports”* **\[S5\]**. 

 Achieving these three policy Impacts in turn generated a cascade of other Impacts including impacting new UK plans, policy objectives and policy frameworks post\-Brexit. Our research directly informed new policy objectives and policy frameworks. Specifically, the *NCC’s* second annual report **\[S7\]**, referred directly to the work package led by **Bateman** and drew on extensive contributions from several other **UEA authors**. Its main recommendation was to produce a long\-term Environment Plan **\[S7\],** directly informed by natural capital/ecosystem services thinking **\[S5\]**. The then Secretary of State for the Environment formally accepted that recommendation in July 2017 **\[S8a\]** which led directly, in 2018, to DEFRA publishing the UK’s very first *25 Year Environment Plan* **\[S8b\]**. Page 15 of that Plan directly cited **Bateman’s** *Science* paper on the use of ecosystem service research in UK decision making **\[R8\]** and Annex 1 contained numerous references to the work of the *NCC* \(e.g., page 6\) and the *NEAFO* \(e.g., page 47\) **\[S8b\]**. 

 According to the Deputy Head of National Biodiversity at DEFRA *“contributions by **UEA**… include\[d\] the integrated model \[which\] provided real\-world land\-use scenarios that quantified, perhaps for the first time, the economic and environmental impacts of land use choices”.* Moreover, “ *the outputs formed a significant component of the evidence base that helped the \[NCC\] convince Government of the value of a natural capital approach and in turn led to the adoption of that approach as a central tenet of the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan.”* **\[S5\]**. Furthermore, this plan will be the first in a rolling series of national *Environmental Improvement Plans* established under the *Environment Act*, expected to be adopted in 2021, the first UK environment act in a generation. According to a *DEFRA* Policy Paper \( *Environmental Bill:* *Environmental Targets*, dated August 2020\) the new Act will only set legally binding long\-term targets in four priority areas, one of which will be biodiversity/ecosystems. 

 Our work also informed internal Whitehall guidance on policy development. *DEFRA’s* Deputy Head of National Biodiversity confirms that our work informed *“findings from the NEAFO more broadly \[which\] were \[in turn\] used to support the development of Defra and Treasury guidance on integrating environmental considerations into policy appraisal \(Defra’s ‘Enabling a Natural Capital Approach’ and the Treasury ‘Green Book’\)”* **\[S5\]**. It is noteworthy that *DEFRA* had earlier commissioned a whole work package of the *NEAFO* \- Workpackage 9 ‘Embedding an Ecosystem Services Framework in Appraisal’ **\[S1**, page 60\] \- \(co\-led by **Jordan**\) to address the \(non\) use of ecosystem knowledge in policy appraisal systems. These systems have since been overhauled to inform government spending right across Whitehall **\[S5\]**. 

 The Executive Director of *UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre* \( *UNEP’s* *WCMC*; the UN body that coordinated the *NEAFO* for *DEFRA*\) states that the *“research performed at **UEA** … played a pivotal role in the \[NEA\] and \[NEAFO\]… Over the last two decades their research has been critically important in conceptualizing the relationship between nature, ecosystem services and economic and non\-economic values”* **\[S4\]**. Moreover, it *“is apparent that these findings influenced the Treasury…. Green Book and the decision to form the Natural Capital Committee….”* **\[S4\]**. 

 **International level Impact and leadership** 

 **Watson’s** leadership underpinned several related international knowledge exchange exercises, which directly impacted policy development activities in the UK and globally. For example, **Watson** chaired the international negotiations that led to the formation of the *Intergovernmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services \(IPBES\)* in 2012 **\[S2\]**. His ideas permeate the conceptual framework that underpins all *IPBES’s* work **\[R2, R5\]**, commensurate with Insights 1 and 5 \(see Section 2\). **Watson** was also instrumental in inventing the ‘nature’s contributions to people’ approach \(see Insight 2\) **\[R2, R4\]**, which is now formally incorporated in the wording of the *UN Convention on Biological Diversity's* strategic plan for biodiversity. *IPBES’s* first *Global Assessment*, published in May 2019 \[see for example **S9\]**, is actively informing the UN’s overarching biodiversity policy framework **\[S2\]**. 

 In the words of the Deputy Executive Secretary of the *UN Convention on Biodiversity*, **Watson** *“played a leading role in the negotiation, governance and work programme of \[IPBES\] … which is the primary mechanism for providing state of the art and governmentally approved assessments that support policymaking and implementation under the \[Convention\].”* Its Global Assessment was *“particularly influential, scientifically, politically and in raising public awareness and understanding… \[It\] brought much\-needed attention to the loss of biodiversity… placing it along\-side climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the global community with equal urgency”* **\[S2\]** *.* Furthermore, the Executive Director of *UNEP’s* *WCMC* confirms that many *“ **UEA… scientists** have contributed significantly to the NEA, NEAFO, IPBES, and IPCC assessments, which have played a vital role in national and international policies to conserve and restore biodiversity”* **\[S4\]**. 

 Meanwhile, the *Dasgupta Review* published its Interim report in April 2020 **\[S6\]**, citing **Watson’s** ideas about nature’s contributions to people **\[R2, R4\]** and drawing directly on the *NEA* and *NEAFO* **\[S6\]**. Its final report will be published in February 2021, but its preliminary findings **\[S5\]** were being anticipated in government throughout 2020. For example, the then Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, attended a preparatory *UN* *Convention on Biological Diversity* meeting on 26 September 2020 and announced a brand new UK\-wide policy goal to improve ecosystem protection \- that 30% of its land and seas will be specially protected by 2030, up 4% from 26% **\[S10\]**. 

 **Summary** 

 Foundational interdisciplinary research conducted at UEA since 2000 continues to exert a significant impact on many influential knowledge exchange activities at national, EU and international levels \[e,g, **S2, S4, S5\]**, leading directly to substantial and long\-lasting policy and societal Impacts. The foundational Impact of **Turner** \(CBE, 2000\), **Watson** \(knighted, 2012; a UN Champion of the World for Science and Innovation\) and **Bateman** \(OBE, 2013\) has been formally recognised by HM Government and the UN.

###  **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Pluralistic therapy enables counselling and psychotherapy practitioners to deliver interventions according to client need and incorporate shared decision\-making into routine practice. 

 Our pluralistic counselling model has had national and international impact on training and practice in the sector, primarily by re\-structuring the training of practitioners and more broadly in the delivery of therapy by adoption of the practice. 

 The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy testifies to the benefits of a new shared language, allowing institutions to work more effectively with each other, and the facilitation of greater client choice and interprofessional working in health and social care. 
","
###  **2. Underpinning research** 

 Approximately 5\-10% of the population in the UK and other countries make use of counselling and psychotherapy to address issues around stress, well\-being, and mental health difficulties. Research conducted at Abertay University underpinned the development of a new, flexible, collaborative framework for integrating therapeutic interventions – **Pluralistic Therapy**. 

 Pluralistic therapy comprises tools and procedures that facilitate active, culturally sensitive, client involvement in shared decision making around therapy goals, tasks, and methods. Its aim is to activate the clients’ personal strengths and resources and involve them to the greatest extent in the therapeutic process. The technique was initially developed by Professor John McLeod \(Abertay University\) in collaboration with Professor Mick Cooper \(University of Roehampton\). In 2007, Cooper and McLeod published a highly cited \(>200 citations\) review paper **\[3.1\]** and accompanying primary text and practitioner guide for pluralistic practice \(>400 citations\) **\[3.2\]**, which for the first time emphasised the importance of shared decision making when integrating different interventions into therapeutic practice. Our pluralistic counselling model was developed, in part, in response to exclusionary lines drawn between different therapeutic orientations, limiting therapists’ ability to be flexible to the needs of the individual client, drawing upon different theoretical approaches where suitable.  Complex interventions, like therapy, require a wide menu of tools and practice\-based methodologies to be of maximal use to diverse clients and their changing needs. 

 Our programme of action research, reflective enquiry, and the application of our model to practice is underpinned by proof of concept of the effectiveness of pluralistic therapy for client outcomes. In 2015, a consortium of universities at Abertay, Roehampton, Salford, South Wales, and York St. John, including Abertay’s co\-founder of the pluralistic counselling model \(John McLeod\), were supported by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy \(BACP\) to examine this empirically. Our research **\[3.3\]** demonstrated that in initial quantitative tests of the effectiveness of pluralistic therapy among people with moderate to severe depression, clients improved in self\-reported depression and anxiety from baseline to endpoint.  In addition, qualitative data indicated that clients perceived pluralistic therapy for depression as helpful and valuable, in light of the flexible and collaborative approach of the therapist and the client’s own active engagement in the therapy. Our model evidenced acceptable retention rates, client improvement, and client satisfaction when put into practice for clients within this population. We found that 72% of completing clients showed reliable improvement and 44% of completing clients showed reliable recovery, with large effect sizes from baseline to endpoint for the patient health questionnaire \(Cohen’s *d* = 1.83\) and generalized anxiety \(Cohen’s *d* = 1.16\). 

 We have continued to develop the model and its associated methods, in part, through reflexive enquiry. For example, as a pluralistic model of practice is centred around shared decision\-making and the therapist’s responsiveness to different client preferences unfolding over time, our research often involves intensive, single\-case methodologies to identify the mechanisms through which therapists can collaborate effectively with their clients across sessions **\[3.4\]**. These methods are recommended by the Medical Research Council for evaluating theory and the effects of complex interventions over time. 

 In sum, our pluralistic counselling model and continuing programme of research and reflexive enquiry has provided a base for innovation in our practice and service delivery, impacting practitioners and clients through the nature of the work we are engaged in and the increased reach of our model.  Our research and pluralistic model have underpinned our unique training programme \(MSc in Counselling\) and the impact that has followed \(see section 4\).

###  **Details of the impact** 

 We have applied and developed our model through reflexive practice, research, outreach, and training. Activities since 2014 have led to new training programmes both in the UK and internationally, changes in how therapists conceptualise their work, innovations in service delivery, and contributing to the public good. 

####  **International impact of the pluralistic counselling model \(reach among practitioners and development of competencies\)** 

 The seminal text on pluralistic counselling **\[3.2\]**, is ranked in the top 250 of books on ‘social welfare and services’, and in the top 300 books on ‘clinical psychology’ and ‘psychological counselling’ \(Amazon\). This text has generated a programme of training and dissemination activities across the current REF period, impacting the way in which therapists work and identify themselves, with Abertay University training more than 200 counsellors and psychotherapists during this period. As the sole deliverer of training in 2007, our model has now expanded its reach and has been incorporated into various UK and international programmes since 2014. During this time, pluralism has been applied as a core model in programmes at the Institute of Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy \(IICP College, Dublin, Republic of Ireland\), the University of South Wales, and the Metanoia Institute in London; pluralism has been integrated into the professional programme at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and in Doctoral training at the University of Roehampton, University of Oslo, University of Manchester, and the University of East London. Thus, we have shaped practice nationally and internationally, as a wide network of institutions are training therapists in our pluralistic model. 

 Support from the BACP, the second largest psychological therapies organisation in the world, provides testament to this impact since 2014. The Chair of the BACP \(2014\-2019\) points to Abertay’s role in driving change among the community of over 50,000 members that the organisation represents. He highlights that pluralism has addressed a sector problem, provided a new language for speaking about therapy, assisted collaboration across different schools of thought in the therapy world and between professions, and that Abertay has been central in launching, developing, and disseminating the practice **\[5.1\]**. He argues that this new shared language has allowed therapists to engage more fully with key developments in health and social care, helping therapists to have a stake in shaping policy on evidence\-based practice for clients/patients. 

 *“Without the leadership and drive of the team at the University of Abertay, we simply would not be where we are now and the national \(and increasingly international\) therapy and research community would be in a much poorer place; as would the clients we serve.”* **\[5.1\]** 

 Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis \(IPA\) research conducted by the Director of IICP College Dublin on the impact of training in pluralistic counselling \(MA in Pluralistic Counselling and Psychotherapy\) suggests that graduates perceive an improvement in client retention, and that their training has fostered a culture of exploring client preferences in a structured manner **\[5.2\]**. This research provides early evidence that a stepped care approach to pluralistic group therapy for children is useful for offering interventions, reducing waiting lists for children, and improving client outcome scores from baseline. Our pluralistic counselling model has also impacted practice in Norway, where it has been widely adopted in the post\-qualifying training of clinical psychologists **\[5.3, 5.4\]**. For example, our model has influenced one practitioner’s teaching, developmental work, and research, which has, in turn, innovated his practice when dealing with difficult presentations from families and the patients of the Norwegian Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents. The model has been incorporated into both a Masters in Clinical Health Work Programme and the Diploma in Therapeutic Work with Patients with Mental Health and Addiction Problems **\[5.4\]**. 

 *“As a practicing therapist in Mental Health for Children and Adolescents at the Hospital of Drammen, Norway, the pluralistic approach has been central for the task of developing more flexible and responsive forms of family\-based practice”* **\[5.4\]** 

 UKRI support has been critical in developing our impact by widening practitioner networks and developing practitioner competencies. For example, ESRC funding **\[3a\]** to run a series of seminars and workshops involving leading international figures in psychotherapy case study methodology, enabled our colleagues to develop new strategies for collecting and analysing therapy case data. This, in turn, led to the development of case\-study research and funding for the development of a task\-list approach for counselling in diabetes **\[3b\]**. This enabled us to apply the therapeutic menu aspect of our pluralistic model to a novel client group and include the model in professional training delivered to NHS staff and practitioners via the pluralistic practice network. Further evidence of our increased international reach since 2014 includes the support we have provided for continuing professional development via the *International Conference on Pluralistic Counselling and Psychotherapy* held at Abertay \(2018 >200 delegates from over ten countries\), Roehampton \(2019 >200 delegates\) and online \(2020 >800 delegates\). The pluralistic network \(run by staff and graduates\) has an online forum \(pluralisticpractice.com\) for resources, community groups, and outreach which has built a community for >1000 unique weekly visitors from 20 countries. The Head of Professional Standards at the BACP testifies **\[5.5\]** to the impact of our model in enhancing quality within the counselling profession: 

 *“\[the model\] … is increasingly presented as core theory by new applicants for membership as well as those applying for accreditation… This pluralistic approach is increasingly important for building a shared understanding of what makes therapy work and for defining generic standards for the profession which take us beyond the confines of single approaches and enables those with very different traditions to work together in the best interests of clients. This owes a lot to the work of the University of Abertay as a leading institution in establishing the pluralistic approach.”* **\[5.5\].** 

####  **Impact on practitioners and service delivery** 

 As pluralistic counselling is flexible at the point of delivery and responsive to complex needs, it can be used for a wide range of client groups in a wide range of service contexts, for example, by providing a therapeutic menu of activities tailored to the client’s preferences. Data from graduates during the current REF period shows the impact of our pluralistic model on trainees. For example, among our alumni who graduated between 2014 to 2016 inclusive \( *N* = 64, 60% response rate\), 98% of respondents were currently working across Scotland, almost entirely in the third sector, with a variety of age groups including children and students, and many service user groups including NHS patients, people with long\-term health conditions and their families or carers, people dealing with other adverse circumstances \(e.g., poverty, bereavement\), and in forensic contexts \(police, prisoners, survivors of abuse, and substance misusers\). Ninety\-five percent of graduates from this cohort either agreed or strongly agreed that our course helped them in their working life and in their day\-to\-day life \(91%\), equipping them to work as a counsellor \(83%\), and improving their employability \(81%\). Collectively, our pluralistic counselling model is generating impact by reaching wider areas of the community via our graduates. Our model of shared decision\-making, working toward agreed goals, and feedback to guide therapy are valued by clients **\[5.6, 5.7\]**, including more than 180 clients who have participated in ongoing open trials in our counselling clinic at Abertay. The model has also been applied independently to improve the effectiveness and relevance of therapy for under\-served client groups such as older people **\[5.8\]** and refugees **\[5.9\]**. 

 A survey examining the opinions of counselling and psychotherapy practitioners evidences the impact of our pluralistic model on practitioners and their service delivery **\[5.10\]**. This study collated responses from 186 practitioners with an average of 11 years’ experience in therapeutic practice. Respondents perceived pluralistic and collaborative approaches to therapy as effective in improving ‘ *Innovation and adaptability within the clinic/service*’ and in enhancing ‘ *client/therapist factors*’ \(results of a principal components analysis to reduce responses to our survey items to two main factors\).  ‘ *Client/therapist factors’* represented the strongest positive response across our survey items administered to practitioners \( *M* = 4.24 on a 5\-point scale, Cohen’s *d* = 2.02\).  Positive responses to these two factors were observed regardless of whether participants explicitly identified their approach as pluralistic, suggesting that our pluralistic counselling model is perceived as effective in a clinic or service, regardless of how an individual practitioner identifies themselves. 

 *“….. It allows me so much flexibility in how I work with individual clients with their unique wants, needs and preferences. And I can tailor my interventions sensitively to what will help them work towards achieving their goals. I still never cease to be amazed with what can be achieved by a counsellor and client working collaboratively on the page they have written and improvised together, step\-by\-step, on the journey of discovery.”* – Participant \(Aged 70, 10 years’ experience as practitioner\). **\[5.10\]** 

 An early\-stage practitioner also speaks to our impact on service delivery: 

 *“I love Babette Rothschild's words, 'when a therapist is well versed in theory, it becomes possible to adapt to suit the needs of the client rather than requiring the client to adapt to the demands of a particular technique.' For me this is what Pluralism allows \- researching and deliberate practice around theory and being able to convey to a client theory but in relation to their individual needs. I don't feel alone in trying to offer different ways to think about problems as pluralism means reading in many areas so I have many authors walking with me helping the clients choose what sounds right for them.”* – Survey participant \(Aged 54, 1 years’ experience as practitioner\). **\[5.10\]** 

 Our survey also provides corroborating evidence that our pluralistic model is flourishing in terms of its reach, and impact on practitioner competencies **\[5.10\]**. Our respondents were generally satisfied with the development of pluralistic and collaborative approaches to therapy in terms of ‘ *voice and community*’, ‘ *collaboration and knowledge creation*’, and ‘ *guides and standards*’ \( *M* = 3.60 on a 5\-point scale\). Positive responses were observed regardless of whether the respondent identified as pluralistic in their approach, providing evidence that our model and protocol is reaching different communities. Practitioners perceived the approach as effective in improving their own ability to use feedback from clients and work effectively with clients who have complex problems.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor William Green’s research at the University of Leicester in collaboration with clinicians has: enhanced doctor’s wellbeing in the workplace; improved their prescribing performance; and reduced contributing factors to patient harm and patient deaths. The research takes a holistic, systems approach to patient safety and has led to a widely adopted intervention: personalised, structured, video\-enhanced feedback and deliberate practice following high\-fidelity simulations, which was developed following a human\-centred design approach incorporating clinicians, managers, patients, junior doctors, pharmacists and medical educators. Economic analysis demonstrates that this is a cost\-effective intervention, saves hospital bed days, and reduces waste and litigation. This has been demonstrated across seven acute National Health Service \(NHS\) Trusts in England and two in New Zealand, and influenced the sector more broadly. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Medical errors are a significant global challenge, recognised by the World Health Organization who in 2017 announced their Third Global Patient Safety challenge: Medication Without Harm. Medication errors are a complex and systemic contributing cause of preventable patient harm. As an estimate, research funded in 2018 by the UK Department of Health Policy Research Programme suggested 237 million medication errors occur annually in England, with associated costs to the NHS of GBP98,462,582, consuming 181,626 bed\-days, and causing 712 deaths whilst contributing to a further 1,708 deaths. 

 Professor Green, University of Leicester School of Business \(ULSB\), has been leading a series of regional, national and international inter\-disciplinary research projects to reduce medical errors and improve patient safety in collaboration with healthcare practitioners since 2012 \(total funding over GBP500,000\). The research builds on his background in Human Factors and Ergonomics, approaching the design of socio\-technical healthcare systems from a whole systems viewpoint \[ **R1–R3**\]. To ensure that the outcomes of the research can be applied and fit the working environment, the research has been conducted *in situ* **\[R1, R2\]** and in collaboration with clinicians, managers, patients, junior doctors, pharmacists and medical educators \(notably Dr Rakesh Patel, University of Leicester Medical School, 2012–2017\). The team also drew on the work psychology expertise of Professor Stephen Wood in ULSB with whom Green had previously collaborated **\[R7\]**. 

 Green’s research \[ **R2–R5\]** focuses on medicine prescribing errors. Prior research funded by the General Medical Council in 2009 established that Foundation Year \(FY\) doctors in their first and second year of medical training following graduation, are significantly more likely to make a medication prescribing error in comparison to experienced colleagues. The research of Professor Green and colleagues focused on the reasons for medication prescribing errors, which led to the design of the EPIFFANY intervention **\[R3–R6\]**. The intervention \(detailed in **R3**\) takes prescribers through high\-fidelity ward\-round simulations with real patients, which look and feel like a real hospital environment but provide prescribers with a safe environment to practice. Following the simulations, prescribers are provided with video\-based, personalised feedback of their interactions with patients. 

 Research evaluating the effectiveness of this intervention **\[R3, R4, R6\]** has demonstrated significantly positive outcomes for practice and patient safety. Specifically, there was no significant difference in error rates of FY prescribers who received the intervention when compared with those of experienced prescribers **\[R3\]**. FY prescribers not participating in the intervention had statistically significantly higher error rates and patients seen by them experienced statistically significantly higher prescribing error rates. Conversely, patients seen by the FY prescribers who received the intervention experienced a statistically significantly lower rate of ‘significant errors’ compared to patients seen by the experienced prescribers. At Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust, improvements in Human Factors and non\-technical skills \(communication\) were also observed and significant. The break‐even analysis demonstrates cost‐effectiveness for the intervention **\[R3, R4\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Impact of EPIFFANY on the Commission on Education and Training for Patient Safety** 

 EPIFFANY was used as an exemplar to *“Ensure staff have the skills to identify and manage potential risks*” in the ‘Commission on Education and Training for Patient Safety’ report ‘Improving Safety Through Education and Training’ **\[E1\]**. In the report—led by Sir Norman Williams \(former President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England\), and Sir Keith Pearson, \(Chair of Health Education England\)—Recommendation 12 uses EPIFFANY as the example of best practice. It states: “ *The Commission were impressed with the results and would like to see this project expanded to have wider engagement with other \[medical postgraduate\] students and staff* ” **\[E1\]**. EPIFFANY was also quoted in the Commission’s report following an independent evaluation of evidence by the Centre for Health Policy at Imperial College London **\[E2\]**. 

 **Impact on Health Education England \(HEE\): medical training tender must be based on EPIFFANY intervention** 

 HEE is an executive non\-departmental public body. It is responsible for the development of the healthcare workforce in England, ensuring the NHS has the right size of workforce, with the right skills, values and behaviours. Following the Commission’s report **\[E1\]**, HEE put out a tender in July 2016 for the *“Delivery of an Educator Support Programme for Secondary Care Educators working within Local Education Providers within the East Midlands”* **\[E3\]**. This was a response to an NHS Employers commissioned report by the Nuffield Trust which proposed NHS Trusts having, *“the right number of appropriately skilled staff”* being critical to the determinants of quality and efficiency of healthcare. HEE dictated that the approach to be taken for anyone tendering to be based on EPIFFANY and to deliver across sixteen secondary care sites in the East Midlands region **\[E3**, p3 **\]**. Subsequently, the EPIFFANY intervention was presented to all sixteen sites through HEE workshops. 

 **EPIFFANY used as a national case study** 

 EPIFFANY won the 2014 East Midlands Academic Health Science Network \(AHSN\) Innovation Awards in the Frontline Innovation Award. It subsequently won the 2015 HEE Chair’s Recognition Award for Research and Innovation. This meant HEE wanted to adopt the EPIFFANY intervention nationally. As a result, the EPIFFANY intervention is used as an exemplar by the ASHN **\[E4, E5, E6\]**, emphasizing that it would be rolled out following the successes at University Hospitals of Leicester \(UHL\) NHS Trust and United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust. At the national NHS Confederation in 2017 EPIFFANY was a Case Study for the AHSN **\[E5\]**: *“the NHS Confederation is the only membership body that brings together and speaks on behalf of the whole NHS”*. This resulted in EPIFFANY becoming a case study on the AHSN’s National Atlas of Solutions in Healthcare **\[E6\]**, with a quote from the Head of Quality and Education for HEE East Midlands stating: “ *EPIFFANY is a fantastic example of supporting and enhancing junior doctors’ education and training. It’s been demonstrated to improve prescribing behaviour, wellbeing and keep patients safer while in hospital through a safety culture. We’re thrilled that something supported by HEE across the East Midlands is now being rolled out to more areas and would like to see it taken up further and across the whole of England*” **\[E6\]**. 

 **Intervention adoption resulting from impact on medical practice and patients – significantly reducing the likelihood of patients experiencing prescribing errors** 

 The initial research **\[R3–R6\]** at University Hospitals of Leicester \(UHL\) NHS Trust led to the adoption of the intervention at nine further hospitals, six in England, two in New Zealand and one in Wales. This led to significant improvements in prescribing practice for FY doctors and patient safety in all locations. As an example, EPIFFANY was adopted at Pilgrim Hospital, Boston, United Lincolnshire Hospitals \(ULH\) NHS Trust in 2015 on the request of HEE, following the suggestion from \(NHS Medical Director at the time\) after seeing a presentation by the AHSN about the research \(noting the significance of the report **\[E1\]** and case study **\[E5\]** noted above\). The evaluation **\[R3\]** at ULH NHS Trust led to similarly significant results to the initial study in Leicester. Notably, of the 554 patients observed in the study period, the 265 patients seen by the FY doctors who had participated in the EPIFFANY intervention \(as opposed to the FY doctors in the control group\) were at least twice as likely to experience a minor, significant and serious medication prescribing error from a FY doctor who did not participate. Further sites who have adopted EPIFFANY are: 

1.  ULH NHS Trust \(2015\-\) **\[R3, E10\]** 

1.  Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust \(2017\-\) **\[E7\]** 

1.  Waitemata District Health Board, New Zealand \(2017\-\) **\[E9\]** 

1.  Canterbury District Health Board, New Zealand \(2017\-\) **\[E9\]** 

1.  Sherwood Forest Hospitals \(SFH\) NHS Trust \(2017\-\) **\[E8a\]** 

1.  Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh \(WWL\) NHS Foundation Trust \(2017\-\) **\[E8g\]** 

1.  Chesterfield Royal Hospital \(CRH\) NHS Foundation Trust \(2018\-\) **\[E8d, E8e\]** 

1.  Northampton General Hospital \(NGH\) NHS Trust \(2018\-\) **\[E8b, E8c\]** 

 In four of the NHS Trusts EPIFFANY was adopted and adapted as the mandated training for all new medical doctors \(SFH, WWL, CRH, NGH\) **\[E8\]** with between 30\-60 doctors onboarded and trained annually at each Trust since 2017/2018. As a result, it has reduced the contributory factors to patient deaths, reduced prescribing errors and reduced the number of medication errors **\[E8\]**. The Director of Medical Education at SFH NHS Trust articulates the significance of this by suggesting it also improves the confidence and general positive feeling of the participating doctors towards working for the NHS **\[E8f\]**; this is critically important given pressure on the NHS workforce: 

 *“\[W\]e presented a business case for the NHS Trust board to support our adoption of EPIFFANY as normal business. This means that the intervention is sustained and we are running it every summer for new doctors. The business case was supported by the board for two main reasons. First, the decrease in error rates in the EPIFFANY prescribers following the simulations in the July 2017 cohort. . . . Second, this reduction was coupled with exceptional feedback from participating doctors who suggested that the opportunity to participate should be offered to all junior doctors. Notably, the feedback from the trainees who took part was excellent, reportedly increasing confidence and knowledge around complex prescribing. This has translated into a reduction in TTO error rates as well as a reduction in Datix reports involving prescribing.*” **\[E8a\]**. 

 Following a pilot in 2018, EPIFFANY has now been adopted as part of junior doctors’ mandatory training when entering WWL NHS Trust. The WWL Professional Development and Clinical Assurance Pharmacist who led the adoption of EPIFFANY states, *“The benefits of the programme exceed the original targets – i.e. demonstrating a reduction in prescribing errors, although this remains the ultimate goal”* **\[E8f\]**. WWL NHS Trust are using EPIFFANY as part of a learning system to support junior doctors’ progress through their first foundation year. 

 Participating junior doctors unanimously claim positive impacts on their practice as a result of participating in EPIFFANY: *“\[The simulations and feedback\] help you to then go back on to the wards and . . . develop a more systematic approach to your . . . ward round. . . . The feedback, identified some . . . fairly major things that you need to think about that I hadn’t given enough thought to. . . . \[I\]t was definitely worth doing from that perspective \[and\] I’ve really enjoyed it.”* \(Participating junior doctor\) **\[E8f\]**. 

 The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch \(HSIB\), who conduct independent investigations of patient safety concerns in NHS\-funded care across England, report EPIFFANY being identified as an intervention to tackle serious incidents by the Royal College of Physicians who coordinated a joint working group with other professional bodies to develop and deliver work related to Medication Safety **\[E10\]**. Green presented to this group in 2019. Since then, Green has been working with the Swansea Bay Health Board, the NHS Wales Lead Head of Pharmacy, and the Wales Quality Improvement programme towards adapting EPIFFANY as a part of their national medicine safety programme.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peter Frankopan’s best\-selling *Silk Roads* has captured imaginations and changed ways of thinking around the world. Its extraordinary success has contributed to rectifying a eurocentric imbalance in our understanding of global history, at a time when the Chinese government has sought to create economic and cultural links across the central Asian region through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. Drawing on primary evidence including numismatics, sigillography, material culture, art, and newly available scientific data, Frankopan’s historical research has provided the framework for policy development in response to this dramatic initiative. Drawing on *Silk Roads* and related work, he has advised high\-level policy makers in many countries. In addition to the UK, Ireland, Austria and the EU, he has addressed government officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Through his collaboration with museums, television and radio, Frankopan’s research has also increased public understanding of central Asia among Western publics who have had little exposure to the history and culture of this strategically important region. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Frankopan’s book *The Silk Roads: A New History of the World* \(2015\) **\[R1\]** provides a major re\-assessment of world history from antiquity to the modern day by demonstrating the importance of cultural and economic links through central Asia in global history. His research on the history of the Byzantine empire, the Crusades and the broader central Asian region has highlighted the importance of cultural, medical, economic and human connections across the ancient and early modern world. It draws on a rich series of sources in Greek, Latin, French, Italian, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Russian, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Hebrew, Syriac and Chinese. 

 *The Silk Roads* was widely and prominently reviewed in the press around the world and has since been translated into more than thirty languages. It was described as ‘magnificent’ \( *Sunday Times*\), ‘dazzling’ \( *Guardian*\), ‘a rare book that makes you question your assumptions about the world’ \( *Wall St Journal*\), ‘a treasure’ \( *Libre Belgique*\), ‘phenomenal’ \( *Die Welt*\), ‘a joy’ \( *Le Point*\) and ‘not just the most important history book in years, but the most important in decades’ \( *Berliner Zeitung*\). It featured in Books of the Year of almost every newspaper, magazine and journal in 2015. In 2018, it was named as one of the 25 most important books translated into Chinese over the last 40 years, along with *The Great Gatsby* and *Pride and Prejudice*. At the end of 2019, it was named one of the *Sunday Times*’ ‘Books of the Decade’ \(2010\-20\). It was a *New York Times* Bestseller, and topped the Non\-Fiction charts in a number of countries, including India, the UAE and China. In 2018 it was also adapted for children as an illustrated edition by Bloomsbury Children’s Books for ages 9 and over. **\[R2\]** 

 Since the publication of *The Silk Roads*, Frankopan has expanded his research to explore connections between the historical development of this region and current geopolitical, cultural and economic challenges, especially China’s Belt and Road Initiative to invest approximately USD 1 trillion in connectivity between Asia, Africa and Europe. **\[R3, R4\]** The BRI was launched by the Chinese government in 2013 and comprises a Silk Road Economic Belt – a trans\-continental passage that links China with south east Asia, south Asia, Central Asia, Russia \(https://www.ebrd.com/russia.html\) and Europe by land – and a 21st century Maritime Silk Road *,* a sea route connecting China’s coastal regions with south east and south Asia, the South Pacific, the Middle East and Eastern Africa, all the way to Europe. This major global initiative is explicitly grounded in an understanding of China’s historic links to its neighbouring regions. **\[R3, R4\]**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **\(i\) Public Policy Impact** 

 Frankopan’s research has fed into the development of foreign policy and development policy in many different forums. Drawing on his research, he helped shape policy for the **Asian Development Bank** \(ADB\) concerning global change in the 21<sup>st</sup> century when he took part in a forum at the ADB’s Annual Meeting in Manila in May 2018. One of the aims of the forum was 'delve into the past using an unconventional lens to frame one of the biggest global economic shifts’, namely 'Asia’s re\-emergence as a global economic powerhouse’. **\[E1\]** Frankopan’s input into the ADB’s developing policy in Asia was recognised in invitations to their annual meetings in both 2019 and 2020. On the last occasion he wrote and circulated a policy paper on ‘Regional Co\-operation in the Time of CoVid\-19: Lessons Learned and the Way Forward.’ He then chaired a flagship meeting of ministers and senior government officials from the 11 countries involved \( **China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia**\) on the subject of enhancing regional co\-operation. The Regional Cooperation Specialist of the ADB describes the CAREC programme as ‘one of the \[bank’s\] most important initiatives’ and has stated that Frankopan’s policy paper 'provided an excellent overview of the challenges and opportunities currently faced by the member states, especially as we enter a post\-pandemic world’. **\[E2\]** 

 In 2017\-18, Frankopan was also appointed a lead expert to the **World Bank** project on transportation networks in South Asia. His research highlighted the importance of considering the history of these networks, their current development and their future impact, with the aim of advising governments, government agencies, non\-government organisations, multi\-lateral bodies and other stakeholders on developing policies. He was part of the Core Team from the UK Department for International Development \(DfID\) for the project. **\[E3.1\]** The report \(c.260 pages\) was published in August 2018, and has been downloaded over 43,000 times by users in over 100 countries. **\[E3.2\]** Frankopan has also provided advice to the UN’s **Industrial Development Organization** \(UNIDO\) about the future of cities in Asia. **\[E4\]** 

 Based on his historical research, Frankopan advised **UNESCO** on their Silk Roads Programme, which seeks to help preserve the cultural and human heritage of countries spanning the region between the Mediterranean and the Pacific. \[Text removed for publication\] He was subsequently appointed a member of the Scientific Panel of the UNESCO Silk Roads Youth Research Grant programme and is now Vice\-Chair of this group. **\[E5.3\]** 

 The high profile of Frankopan’s research means that his advice has also been sought by European governments. 

 \[Text removed for publication\] 

 Since 2019, Frankopan has been asked to provide advice on political, economic, military and technological policy by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence, the Royal Navy and the Office of the Prime Minister. 

 \[Text removed for publication\] 

 **\(ii\) Transforming Public Understanding** 

 Following the success of *The Silk Roads* **\[R1\]**, Frankopan acted as adviser for Joanna Lumley’s 4\-part ITV series *Silk Roads Adventure*, a major documentary series that was aired in 2018. The four episodes averaged 3,700,000 viewers each **\[E11.1\]** and it remains available on Amazon Prime Video. Frankopan appears in the credits, and Lumley confirms reading *Silk Roads* as part of her research in *The Times.* **\[E11.2\]** Feedback \(Amazon\) included ‘I had never realised how diverse the culture, history and lifestyle was of the communities inhabiting the remote regions.’ **\[E11.3\]** 

 In 2018, Frankopan led a ‘Silk Roads Study Day’ at the **British Museum**, helping to devise a programme that was aimed at non\-specialists and specialists alike. The Head of Adult Programmes at the Museum reported ‘overwhelmingly positive responses’ from those who attended, remarking that ‘hosting a study day with such a prominent expert was enormously helpful for the Museum and for the curators in enabling them to showcase the objects and their own research to a wider audience’. **\[E12\]** In November 2018, he formally opened an exhibition on No Man’s Land at the British Museum which was centred on the history of Mesopotamia from the kingdom of Lagash \(3000 BC\) to the Sykes\-Picot agreement \(1916\). 

 Frankopan’s achievement in rebalancing public understanding of global history has been recognised in many other ways. Since 2018, Frankopan has also had a regular column in the *Evening Standard*, where he uses his research to comment on historical and current events. Between 2017 and 2019, he hosted an audio channel on British Airways In\-Flight Entertainment system, featuring selections of World Music, chosen from countries of the Silk Roads to promote cultural exchange based on his historical understanding of the region. The popular resonance of Frankopan’s work is illustrated by references to the *Silk Roads* in Philip Pullman’s *Belle Sauvage* \(2017\) and his *Secret Commonwealth* \(2019\) and the fact that it inspired the character Astrid in the HBO TV series *Vikings*, watched by millions in the United States and Canada.  The creator of the series explained, ‘I’ve read this great book, called “The Silk Road,” which was showing that in the Dark Ages, it might have been the Dark Ages to the western culture, but to the east, there was trade, cultural exchange.’ **\[E13\]** Pullman has stated that ‘Peter Frankopan’s study of the Silk Roads and their influence on world history had a great impact on me. It clarified and illuminated something that had previously seemed to me part of a background, and revealed its immense importance.’ **\[E14\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Translation is a vital facilitating component of the globalised economy, and a multi\-billion USD industry in itself. The position of the human translation workforce is threatened by the \(often hasty\) adoption of AI\-led machine translation \(MT\) by Language Service Providers \(LSPs\). By investigating the overlooked human aspects in MT\-incorporated workflows, Dr. Akiko Sakamoto and Dr. Begona Rodríguez de Céspedes’ work mapped a route to cement human skills into the translation process, and maintain a sustainable professional workforce for the future industry. Their recommendations were adopted by educational and professional organisations in the EU, UK and Japan, which continue to shape best practice around technology adoption for their members and commercial subscribers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Sakamoto and Rodríguez de Céspedes’ research has investigated the often\-neglected human factors in the adoption of technology, particularly MT, in the translation production system. Using mixed\-methods forms of inquiry, their research examined the causes of the disruption brought to the conventional production system, and sought effective remedies for safeguarding the most important human workers, i.e., translators, from hasty adoptions of technology, which is often led by an unsustainable urge to obtain high quality outputs, rapidly, at a low price. 

 Based on a detailed analysis of Europe\-wide documentation of professional translator training, Rodríguez de Céspedes’ initial work in this area \(R1\) argued that there was a lack of development of sustainable employability skills. Subsequent focus\-group research \(R2\) demonstrated that the industry’s overemphasis on translators’ peripheral technological competences risked hampering the nurturing of core skills, which could provoke a ‘drain’ of the high\-quality workforce from the translation industry. As a countermeasure, she advocated the teaching of a more focused professional skill set at university MA courses. 

 Expanding the remit of enquiry beyond translator training, and responding to demands from the translation industry to address workplace practice, Sakamoto and Rodríguez de Céspedes’ further research examined the views and experience of human actors about recent adoptions of technologies in the UK \(R2, R3\) and Japan \(R5\), the latter in collaboration with Prof Masaru Yamada at Kansai University, with external funding \(G1, G2\). This work identified a series of key problems, masked behind the conflicting interests of different stakeholders. Both studies were conducted collaboratively with the countries’ national professional associations: the ITI \(Institute of Translation and Interpreting\) in the UK and the JTF \(Japan Translation Federation\) in Japan. 

 This research deepened the focus on the growing but contentious production practice of machine translation post\-editing \(MTPE\). In MTPE, workers edit automated MT outputs instead of translating texts from scratch. LSPs, facing high demand for rapid translation services, have been eager to commission MTPE in place of end\-to\-end human translation. Acknowledging the potential value of technological innovation, the research highlighted that, in practice, the current process of MTPE adoption by LSPs was creating three dimensions of potential harm to the industry: 

 1. Unrealistic pricing models: \(R4, R5\) discovered that the current MTPE pricing models are based on the LSPs’ poor understanding about the cognitive process of post\-editing work and the real social values of translators’ skill sets. The findings produced recommendations that MTPE pricing should reflect the value of translators’ skill sets more accurately so that it does not hamper their career motivations. 

 2. Skills gaps in post\-editing: \(R2, R5\) argued that LSPs are underestimating the real skills requirements for post\-editing work, jeopardizing the quality of final translation products. This is causing harm to recruitment practices in two ways: on the one hand by harming the appeal of the work to skilled translators; on the other hand by exposing aspiring and early\-career translators to the risk of exploitation. The research findings demonstrated how LSPs can hire translators in a way which respects their skill sets, and how translators of different skill sets at different career stages can more effectively make informed decisions about the work they take on. 

 3. Lack of clear guidelines for translators’ private MT use: \(R6\) discovered that obscurity on the question of how to use MT effectively and legitimately in their work is confusing many translators, sometimes leading them to misuse it unwittingly. Uploading materials to a “free” service such as Google Translate may be a violation of their contractual terms for non\-disclosure, and providing free intellectual property to a third party. The research recommended the establishment of clearer guidelines about this practice between LSPs and their translators.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 From its outset, this research was integrated into networks of translator training and professional representation, and has had a wide\-ranging influence on policy makers, corporations and translators in the UK, Europe and Japan. 

 **Transforming professional\-education policy and practice across the EU** 

 Since 2006, formal EU\-wide policy on translator education has been centrally defined by the **European Master’s in Translation \(EMT\)**, an educational division of the European Commission’s Directorate General for Translation. EMT accredits masters’ level translation programmes, against a 35\-point Translation Competence Framework. 

 When this framework was reviewed in 2017, Rodríguez de Céspedes was invited onto the Expert Group for this process. Based on her recommendations, three new competence items were adopted, addressing the importance of acquiring modern translation technology skills \(Point 15\), monitoring on\-going industry requirements \(Point 27\) and continuous professional development \(Point 26\) \(S1\). 

 The new competence framework \(S2\) is now mandatory for all 80 leading translation MA courses in the EMT network. It has particularly influenced the educational provisions of new member programmes accredited in 2019, prompting them to start new professionally\-oriented modules. For example, Jagiellonian University recognised Rodríguez de Céspedes’ *“great value to research on the use of technology tools in translator education”* and *“great contribution to the development of the framework”*, as they revised their programmes in consequence \(S3\). As a result of this research, there has thus been a significant material change in translator\-education policy, extending its reach across the entire EU and beyond. 

 **Transforming professional policy in the UK** 

 **The Institute of Translation and Interpreting \(ITI\)** is the largest language industry association in the UK, with 90 corporate members \(LSPs\) and 3010 individual professional members \(translators\). Through its stringent member accreditation system, the ITI serves the GBP1.35 billion UK language market \(the second largest in the world\) as well as the international market, as a major source of highly\-skilled translators. 

 From 2016, the ITI executive’s new Chair, Ms Sarah Bawa\-Mason, \(familiar with this research through employment at University of Portsmouth as a part\-time translation lecturer\), began to work actively to protect its members’ human agency and professional values from the perceived threat of automation. The ITI became a national collaborator from the initial stages of the UK\-based research, and commissioned an industry report from the team in 2017, exploring industry stakeholders’ thoughts and attitudes about technological developments in the UK translation industry \(S4\). By August 2020, this report had been accessed online over 3500 times, indicating very significant penetration into the professional audience. 

 ITI used Sakamoto and Rodríguez de Céspedes’ research findings to launch a new public relations strategy, more widely disseminating the translators’ voice within the technology\-driven LSP business landscape. Ms Bawa\-Mason discussed the research at key venues for debate over technology in translation, appearing at ten international conferences in the UK, USA, Europe and Australia in 2018 and 2019. Ms Bawa\-Mason noted that it was *“Thanks to the work of Drs Sakamoto and Rodríguez de Céspedes”* that she was able to make *“strong arguments for the human’s position in the translation process alongside the technologies”* \(S5\). 

 ITI also launched the ITI Research Network, a new member education division, with Rodríguez de Céspedes as one of the founding members and advisors. This has channeled research\-based information from the academic community to its policy\-making board as well as its individual members through their CPD programmes \(see further below\). This has engaged the ITI membership with wider perspectives on their industry and professional status, working to dispel some of the anxieties and misperceptions identified through the earlier research. The Research Network published two e\-books of academic and professional contributions on their members’ Knowledge Hub, addressing *The Human and the Machine* and *Ethics and Machines in an Era of New Technologies*. The first of these has been accessed over 500 times. The Network’s reach has been cemented by further academic/industry crossovers, such as its 2020 ‘Faraday’ event. Here, 14 high\-profile Translation Studies academics from 11 UK and European universities attended and showcased their cutting\-edge research, confirming ITI’s newly\-forged link with the high\-quality research community \(S5\) **.** 

 **Transforming UK practitioners’ understandings** 

 The research team’s most recent recommendations were shared by Sakamoto with ITI members initially through a small CPD workshop in January 2020, with an audience of 50, and then through two articles in the ITI’s bi\-monthly member magazine in March and July 2020. A subsequent ITI member webinar in November 2020 directly engaged 219 translators, and the recording was watched by a further 93 viewers by the end of the year, being the third most popular event of the year on the ITI’s busy webinar programme \(S5\). The workshop was also in demand in Europe: University of Ghent, Belgium, one of Europe’s leading translation education institutions, hosted Sakamoto’s webinar for its translation students in October 2020. 

 The workshops boosted the translators’ confidence in their decision\-making about whether to take up post\-editing work, and if so, how. Immediate feedback showed that half of the attendees confirmed their existing plan of not taking up post\-editing work *\(“I think the webinar confirmed that PE is not something for me.” “I was thinking about it as I have recently been offered it but now I don't want to do it”\)*, the other half were willing to take it up but with a stronger understanding of the issues *\(“I changed my mind that I won’t turn down flat MTPE assignments as long as I can agree on the pricing through a proper negotiation process as I leant in the workshop”, “I would probably raise my rates for MTPE”\).* It also influenced the Ghent translation students’ career aspirations by prompting them to think of good professional practices *\(“I will be more careful using free online translation tools”*\) and to strengthen their human translation skills *\(“I think I am going to try to use less MT when I do translations.”\)*  \(S6\). 

 **Transforming business practice in Japan** 

 Transformation of translators’ practices requires corresponding efforts on the side of LSPs, their work commissioners. The research was extended to Japan, where an impact on LSPs was achieved by collaboration with the Japan Translation Federation \(JTF\), with support from external funding \(G3\). JTF is Japan’s only translation industry association, with 250 corporate and 300 individual members. The research assisted the JTF in fulfilling one of their missions, to provide reliable information to industry stakeholders, and, as its journal editor observed, it “has raised the Federation’s credibility as an information provider to its members and other industry stakeholders” \(S7\). Sakamoto co\-authored an industry report on the JTF’s website \(S8\), as well as a feature article for the JTF’s bi\-monthly industry magazine *JTF journal* \(800 hard copies and 3,500 downloads\) \(S7\). The *Interpreting and Translation Journal* \(circulation 20,000\), the only commercial translation\-career magazine in Japan, also reported the findings \(S9\). 

 As a result, the research and its recommendations have begun to influence the way Japanese LSPs design their MTPE operations. One such LSP noted how the research brought them to recognise *“the importance of open communication and clear agreement about new MT production procedures with clients”*, and therefore to introduce a new pre\-project client negotiation procedure in 2019. This enabled the clients *“to achieve the expected quality and to get understanding about the rationale behind the pricing”* and *“has resulted in extremely positive feedback from them”* \(S10\). These kinds of changes in LSPs’ operations are important for ensuring sustainable working conditions for individual translators and post\-editors. 

 These impacts have led to an ongoing collaboration not only with ITI and JTF, but now also with UK’s LSP association \(Association of Translation Companies\) and the USA’s translator association \(American Translator Association\) to undertake a new research project about translators’ well\-being and the future of their work \(S5\). This should have a continuing impact on the international cross\-industry efforts to maintain a sustainable global workforce in the face of automation.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Hope and team investigated the inadequate servicing of local water pumps in sub\-Saharan Africa which has led to changes to practice, technology and policy in the provision of water services in rural Kenya. Research findings initiated a social enterprise, FundiFix, which deploys ‘smart’ water handpumps \(developed as part of the research\) and generates real\-time data on their use and performance. FundiFix relies on an innovative combination of community and donor funding to service the pumps, and currently offers secure drinking water to over 82,000 rural Kenyans. The Fundifix model has now been recognised by national\-scale legislation in Kenya. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Following the UN’s designation of the 1980s as the ‘International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade’, many rural communities in Sub\-Saharan Africa were provided with new boreholes and handpumps to access groundwater for their daily water needs. Communities were given responsibility for their new water system, but little support to maintain them. Hundreds of millions of people rely on these pumps but up to a third are out of action at any one time. Communities then face the choice of using water from an unsafe source or spending long hours walking to the nearest functioning handpump. Partly because of this, 54% of the rural population across Sub\-Saharan Africa has to make do with water that is likely to be unreliable or unsafe to drink. 

 Given the uncertainty of external funding for pump maintenance, the research in rural Kenya led by Hope began by investigating communities' preferences and willingness\-to\-pay for water services. Data was collected through water point mapping, a survey of 3,500 households, examination of community and government records, social choice experiments and focus group discussions at local level, and key informant interviews at policy level, as well as the application of insurance thinking and risk modelling \[ **R1\-R3**\]. The research clarified how much rural communities are willing and able to pay for water services \[ **R1**\]. It showed that these communities value a rapid maintenance service but not if repairs take more than five days \[ **R2**\]. It also demonstrated that they do not prefer current institutional arrangements – community management with \(theoretical\) government support – and are open to private sector engagement \[ **R3**\]. 

 These findings were used to design a new service delivery model: the social enterprise FundiFix, originally set up in 2013 as part of an ESRC grant. Fundifix initially provided free repairs to 200 water pumps \(underwritten by the research grant\). Further research has led to the development of new financial models, blending user payments with government and donor financing \(known as PPP, or Private Public Partnerships\) \[ **R4**\]. 

 Subsequent work by the team has situated the development of PPP funding models for rural water services within the wider landscape of institutional theory by adapting the cultural theory of risk originally developed by anthropologist Mary Douglas \[ **R5**\]. This led to the insight that formal institutional and legislative arrangements may restrict pluralistic arrangements such as PPP, and must be addressed if such approaches are to thrive \[ **R5**\]. 

 A final element underpinning the team's impact was the development of the Water\-point Data Transmitter device \[ **R6**\]. Installed in a handpump – which is then 'smart' – this device generates, processes, and transmits hourly information on real\-time abstraction volumes and breakdown incidents over the mobile phone network. This data underpins FundiFix’s service provision, allowing the identification of broken pumps in near real\-time \[ **R6**\]. The team's research shows that these smart pumps reduced the average downtime of the 200 pumps from one month to three days, with 45% of repairs completed within a day \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Research including **R1**\- **R3** informed the design and founding of FundiFix in 2013. The  evidence\-based approach of this social enterprise \(initially elaborated in the underpinning research **R6** and **R1**\- **R3**, and later developing to incorporate learning from **R4**\- **R5**\) has enabled the company to evolve from a small social enterprise in 2013 into an independent organisation offering reliable and safe drinking water to 82,000 people in Kenya’s rural counties of Kitui and Kwale. Repair times for handpumps have been reduced substantially, and up to 20,000 users have benefitted from improvements to water infrastructure. The research has also influenced the development of the funding structure and legislative basis of the FundiFix model. 

 **The growth of Fundifix as an independent company, enabling improved water provision in rural Kenya** 

 Since 2013, FundiFix has evolved into a Kenyan\-owned and registered social enterprise. Servicing 200 water pumps in that year, the company held 130 maintenance contracts with communities and schools, which serve a population of 82,000 people in Kitui and Kwale counties including 25,000 pupils in 74 local schools in December 2020 \[ **E1**\]. FundiFix therefore ensures the reliable delivery of around 73,000,000l of drinking water annually \[ **E1**\]. 

 FundiFix also provides local employment and training for 17 full\- and part\-time in\-house technicians, engineers and plumbers, and offers opportunities in accounting, business management and marketing \[ **E1**\]. As the Director of FundiFix explains, “we operate local offices to facilitate relationships with rural communities and provide quick response to breakdowns. We have employed professional technicians, own various assets including electrical and plumbing equipment/tools, and maintain stocks of spares at each of local offices to support delivery.” \[ **E2**\]. 

 FundiFix has improved water service provision in two ways. First, use of the Water\-point Data Transmitter device \[ **R6**\] has enabled the company to drastically accelerate the repair of existing ‘smart handpumps’. The 2014 Performance Review of Kenya’s Water Services Sector by the Water Services Regulatory Board \(WASREB\) states that “with this system \[FundiFix\] the average downtime for handpumps in the study area fell from 27 days pre\-trial to under three days, representing a great improvement in performance” \[ **E3**\]. The rapid repairs translate into many hours saved collecting water. Across all the pumps in FundiFix’s care, an estimated 100 person\-days are saved per pump per year, or 12,500 person\-days per year in total. 

 Second, in recent years FundiFix has rehabilitated and upgraded existing water infrastructure and offered new water services for up to 20,000 users in Kitui County. These benefits have been achieved through partnerships with local initiatives and international donors. Specifically: 

-  In Mwingi, a town in Kitui County, existing water infrastructure – the Tharaka Women’s Water Project – was upgraded in 2019. This entailed the repair of storage tanks and more than 50 km pipeline and valves, as well as the installation of production metering and a ‘water ATM’ \(an unmanned smart handpump where people use a pre\-paid fob to buy water\). The costs amounted to KES1,400,000 \(GBP9,258\) and up to 15,000 users benefitted from improved drinking water \[ **E1**\]. 

-  The Ikathima Community Piped Scheme in Kitui County was upgraded and improved in partnership with the Sharewater Foundation in 2018, at a cost of KES620,000 \(GBP4,090\). The works entailed expansion of solar water pumping, installation of a water ATM, rehabilitation of a ‘water kiosk’ \(a smart handpump where people can buy water to take home by paying an attendant\), and six months of repair and maintenance service for the scheme, leading to reliable water access for over 3,000 people \[ **E1**\]. 

-  The Ivonangya Community Piped Scheme in Mwingi North was rehabilitated and improved for KES450,000 \(GBP2,974\) in collaboration with the Hardcore Foundation in 2019. FundiFix has helped to repair a community water kiosk and install a water ATM. This has enabled 24/7 access to water for up to 2,000 people \[ **E1**\]. 

 To date eight rural piped schemes have been rehabilitated since FundiFix has taken over their management as part of an ongoing partnership with UNICEF Kenya \[ **E4**\]. 

 **Developing the FundiFix PPP funding model** 

 The underpinning research \[ **R4**\] has also resulted in an innovative funding model for water services. This has been described by UNICEF Kenya as the FundiFix model \[ **E4**\]. The 2017 Impact Report of UNICEF Kenya demonstrates how the organisation has adopted and promoted the model: “UNICEF continued to build on the innovative Public\-Private Partnerships \(PPP\) model, FundiFix, to improve maintenance services for rural water supplies"" \[ **E4**\]. 

 The challenge of financially sustainable water provision in rural areas is well known because the costs of infrastructure expansion, maintenance and repair are difficult to cover if water use is to be priced at levels that are affordable to all sectors of the population. Local communities play an important role in contributing to the financial sustainability of FundiFix: its community customers contributed over KES4,002,993 \(GBP26,165\), towards maintenance costs in 2019 \[ **E5**\], indicating they value its rapid and reliable service. 

 Nonetheless, other sources of funding are indispensable, and FundiFix has managed to secure these. This is primarily due to the creation of two Water Services Maintenance Trust Funds which subsidise the cost of the service through donor funding of “an estimated GBP165,000 from charities and non\-traditional private companies \[ **E6**\]: 

-  The Hardcore Foundation – a\-not\-for\-profit organisation that works with locally established organizations on various community based projects: EUR5,000; 

-  Base Titanium Ltd., a mineral sands project in Kenya: GBP50,000; 

-  doTerra Ltd. from Kenya: GBP15,000; and 

-  Share GmbH, a social enterprise from Germany: EUR150,000. 

 One of Share GmbH’s founders learned of the research on water infrastructure in Kenya from an article by Koehler in the *Economist*. Share works on a 1\+1 principle, meaning that for each product sold an equivalent product is given to a person in need. Share’s founder explains that: 

 “this concept \[i.e. FundiFix\] was a suitable candidate for Share’s 1\+1 principle, offering exact data on water output and reliable impact for the community. Therefore in 2019, Share contracted the Water Services Maintenance Trust to fund FundiFix in Kitui and Kwale counties to provide this 1\+1 match through its rural water maintenance services … The match is equivalent to over 100 million litres of water provided by FundiFix to more than 80,000 rural water users.” \[ **E7**\] 

 **Changing the legislative framework** 

 Local and national government in Kenya has recognised and promoted FundiFix’s combination of improved service provision and innovative funding methods. A 2019 Research Report from the Sustainable WASH \(Water and Sanitation Hygiene\) Systems Learning Partnership  states that “FundiFix has gained the support of both national and local government”, and confirms that WASREB have highlighted “FundiFix as a good example of the professionalization of rural water services” \[ **E8**\]. 

 The Kenyan Ministry for Agriculture, Water and Livestock Development has convened a quarterly forum for WASH stakeholders in Kitui County since 2016. A County Executive Committee Member confirms that the research has informed the sustainability debate at these fora and has been instrumental in revealing policy gaps and influencing the design of the first County Water Bill. He writes that: 

 ""the work that has been done by Oxford University research and by FundiFix has been important to improving our knowledge of rural water service issues affecting the County and subsequently helped us address access ... Demonstration of the FundiFix model since 2014, including the monitoring and funding approaches, has helped us give more reliable water to more than 58,000 people in Mwingi North and show a new way of providing these services” \[ **E9**\]. 

 At national level, team member Koehler has influenced the Government of Kenya in the development of the Kenyan Water Act by the Government of Kenya. The Act passed in 2016, and Article 94\(3\) of the Act now recognises novel approaches to rural water provision, including private sector with investment and financial plans for rural water services. This marks an important shift from the previous emphasis on community management of water supply. On the basis of the team’s research findings \(published as **R1\-R4**\), Koehler engaged extensively with the Acting Director for Water Services in Kenya’s Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural Resources, who says: 

 ""I am therefore happy to confirm Johanna Koehler’s consultation role and enrichment of the amended Article 94 of the Water Act 2016, which is likely to have consequences for the 58 percent of the total Kenyan population outside formal, piped water service provision areas and the 78 percent that are not actively regulated” \[ **E10**\]. 

 The FundiFix model is now enabled by national\-scale legislation, which institutionally embeds its capability to provide access to clean, safe, locally available water in Kenya \[ **R5**\]. A case study on the use of  smart pumps written by SDSN Trends – an initiative of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network that brings together data experts from across the globe – concludes that: 

 “access to safe and reliable drinking water is a systemic challenge in sub\-saharan Africa and throughout the world. This challenge is magnified by the technical and financial issues that reduce the reliability of handpumps and leave communities struggling to afford basic maintenance. The Smart Handpump Project in Kenya demonstrates an innovative way of remotely collecting data about handpump operation. Combining data with an alternative business model has reduced the pump downtime tenfold in participating communities and improved the reliability of water access” \[ **E11**\].

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\)Research by Edinburgh Napier established the **world’s first** community\-based mangrove and seagrass conservation projects funded by carbon credits. These **help 14,000 of Kenya’s poorest people**, improving health and employment, conserving ecosystems and fighting climate change. Mikoko Pamoja \(the first project\) provides **fresh water for 73%** of the local population, **9 jobs** and **educational facilities for 900 children.** 

 With Vanga Blue Forest \(the 2<sup>nd</sup> project\), these initiatives **protect 550 ha of mangroves** and **200 ha seagrass**, **sequester over 9,000 tonnes CO2/year** and **raise over USD40,000/year** for conservation and livelihoods. 

 They **pioneered the sale of mangrove and seagrass carbon credits**, **received the United Nations Equator prize** and **influenced national and international policy**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Facing rapid climate change, the critical importance of carbon capture and storage in natural ecosystems is clear. Identifying, protecting and expanding key ecosystems are urgent priorities. Mangroves and seagrass meadows \(which, with saltmarsh, are called ‘blue carbon’ habitats\) may have more than 10 times the carbon density of terrestrial forests. An approximate USD1 Billion/year market for carbon credits \(bought by individuals and corporations to offset emissions\) funds terrestrial forest conservation but technical and regulatory barriers made it inaccessible for marine habitats before this work. Interdisciplinary research was needed to establish how vulnerable the ecosystems and their stored carbon were, whether protection and restoration were possible, how national and international policy could support this and how carbon credits could be sold for conservation and development benefit. Professor Mark Huxham \(Edinburgh Napier University \(ENU\) 1995\-present\) was PI for all the research described here with ENU as lead institution. Dr Rob Briers \(Assoc. Prof, ENU 1998\-ongoing\) and 4 PhD students collaborated. Dr James Kairo of Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute \(KMFRI\) was the lead Kenyan scientist. Collaborators from other HEIs are indicated below. Enabling the accreditation and sale of mangrove and seagrass carbon credits required new research in five interdisciplinary areas: 

1.  * **How vulnerable are mangrove forests and seagrass beds in Kenya and what are the effects of their loss?** 

 In 2011, Huxham, Briers and KMFRI produced the first accurate map of mangroves in Kenya, using satellite images, and calculated rates of loss \(0.7%/year\).  Building on this in 2013, Huxham and Briers, working with Professor Fiona Nunan \(Birmingham University co\-I\) Professor Loku Jayatissa \(Ruhuna University Sri Lanka, Co\-I\) and Lesley King \(LTS International Ltd, Co\-I\) modelled forest losses under business\-as\-usual scenarios **\[O1\]** during the iCOAST project **\[P1\].** Hence this strand of work shows rates and drivers of forest loss and likely future trajectories. In 2015, Briers, Huxham and social scientists from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) and Kenya identified the costs to society and local people of this ecological damage. In 2018, the ENU team published the first estimate of seagrass loss for an African country \(≤ 21% over 30 years\), allowing incorporation of seagrass into the mangrove carbon projects **\[O2, P2\].** 

1.  **How much carbon is there in mangrove forests and seagrass beds?** 

 Equations developed by ENU and Edinburgh University scientists in 2012 allowed predictions of above\-ground carbon in Kenyan forests. But most carbon in mangroves and seagrass beds occurs below\-ground; it must be extracted and analysed using techniques from sedimentology. In 2016, the ENU team, with KMFRI colleagues, reported an average of \~1500 t C ha\-1, 8 to 10 times that for terrestrial forests. We mapped stores of belowground carbon across Kenya’s mangroves to identify the most carbon\-dense areas for conservation and the development of payments for ecosystem services projects **\[O3, P3\].** In 2019 ENU and KMFRI estimated stocks and vulnerability of carbon in seagrass beds **\[O4, P2\].** Hence, we know the total carbon stocks at the mangrove and seagrass sites at which we work and can advise project developers and the Kenyan Government on stocks at other sites. 

1.  **How vulnerable is buried carbon if the habitat is destroyed?** 

 ENU led the first experimental test in mangroves of the effects of tree removal on soil carbon and found that it was surprisingly vulnerable **\[O5, P4\].** This allowed the modelling of carbon losses under different scenarios during the accreditation of Mikoko Pamoja. In 2019, similar work in seagrass also showed rapid loss of carbon and facilitated seagrass inclusion, for the first time globally, into a payments\-for\-ecosystem\-services \(PES\) project **\[O4, P2\].** 

1.  **Is it possible to restore grossly degraded areas of the shore?** 

 Around the world, mangrove removal has left thousands of km2 as waste\-lands. Between 2005 and 2013, the ENU and KMFRI teams explored why such sites often failed to recover and developed new ways to restore them. Salinization and wave impacts were revealed as key factors making former forest areas inhospitable to seedlings. Targeted planting with nurse species and mixing species to boost productivity led to forest recovery. 

1.  **How can state institutions, national and international policies work better to help local people protect ecosystems?** 

 The ENU and KMFRI teams, with Professor Caroline Upton \(Leicester University\) and Professor Fiona Nunan \(Birmingham University\), worked with government agencies in Kenya and Tanzania to understand their practices and help them support communities, identifying institutional factors – including poor communication and understanding of powers \- hindering this work, and helping them incorporate research findings into local action **\[O6,P4\].** New projects with IUCN and Dr Dan Friess \(Singapore University\) are linking local lessons to national and international climate policy under the Paris Agreement **\[P5, P6\].**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 ENU research led to the development, implementation and on\-going success of the Mikoko Pamoja \(MP, launched 2013\) and Vanga Blue Forest \(VBF, launched 2019\) projects. These support the health and well\-being of 14,000 people, improve the local environment, enhance environmental education in Kenya and beyond and influence national and international policy on climate change and coastal conservation. In particular, this work has led to: 

 **Improving lives** 

 Since 2013, MP has sold 11,757 credits raising more than USD130,000 for conservation and development. Most project work – including marketing, administration, technical advice, monitoring and community liaison – is done by Kenyan and international volunteers, so 92% of income goes direct to Kenya. Money is allocated to a community fund, governed by local people and spent on priorities decided through an inclusive and democratic process **\[C1\].** Water is a major focus; from 2015 more than 3,500 people have received water from project investments, saving approximately 170,000 hours/year in water collection time \(a job done overwhelmingly by girls and women\). Rates of diarrhoea have halved since installation of water points. Educational investments are also prominent. New school buildings, furniture and hundreds of textbooks have been purchased, with measurable improvements in achievement in an area with traditionally very low educational outcomes. Dispensaries and schools now have potable water; without the project children had to go the whole school day without a drink **\[C2\].** 33 improved cook stoves have been installed into homes, reducing wood use and indoor pollution. One site frequently floods, causing loss of life and livelihoods; a new footbridge will provide safe access to fields. Free sanitary pads are distributed to 300 girls to help address period poverty **\[C12\].** The projects provide direct employment for 14 people and approximately 50% of the local population have directly participated in project activities including tree planting, forest patrolling and coastal clean\-ups. In addition to strategic investments, MP and VBF respond to emergency need; in May 2020, 1107 people received food following the Covid\-19 lockdown. Surveys confirm overwhelming local support. Independent scrutiny by social scientists in 2017 concluded MP was a ‘unique, care\-based project’ **\[C3\].** 

 **Environmental and climate benefits** 

 MP and VBF have sequestered more than 24,000 t CO2 since 2014 and will capture more than 150,000 t CO2 during their 20 year accreditation \(approximately 10% of yearly emissions of Mombasa city or approximately 395,000 London\-Edinburgh return flights\). Since 2013, more than 20,000 trees have been planted, restoring degraded land, stabilising shorelines and supporting fish, molluscs, crustaceans and other fauna **\[C4, linked with O4,O5\].** 

 **Education and public engagement** 

 Since 2015, more than 3,000 Kenyan students \(primary, secondary and tertiary\) have received on\-site education on climate change, sustainability and mangroves **\[C1\].** The work has recruited over 280 international volunteers, including early career scientists, teachers and African environmentalists, who receive training; many now work in related fields. MP has produced curricula materials used in local schools and developed a network of 13 secondary school mangrove champions. Project work helped establish a bursary for local girls and arrange long\-term sponsorship for 27 local children, allowing them to complete secondary and, for some, tertiary education. 33 Kenyan postgraduate research students have been supported through MP and VBF; some now hold senior positions in Kenyan universities and ministries. For example, Dr Joseph Lang’at says *“I was mentored and trained as an ecologist under the Mikoko Pamoja programme with Professor Huxham as my Director of Studies. After graduating with my PhD I worked as a senior advisor on environmental management in the County Government of Bomet and can personally attest to the influence of Mikoko Pamoja on my own opportunities and on national policy”.* Since 2014, MP has hosted 7 visits by community groups and international delegations wishing to learn from its experience as part of deliberate efforts to share knowledge within East Africa and beyond. Since 2014 it has appeared in multiple media outlets including the BBC, The Guardian, The Scotsman, The Sun, The Economist, The Mail and New Scientist. 

 **Changes in national and international policy and understanding around the importance of mangroves and blue carbon** 

 As the first mangrove PES project MP pioneered the use of local laws and institutions to allow co\-management of forests for community benefit; it is explicitly designed to impact policy and practice elsewhere. Within Kenya, it shaped the development of the 2016 national Mangrove Ecosystem Management Policy, governing over 60,000 ha Kenyan forests **\[C5, linked with O6\].** It informed the 2018 National Climate Change Adaptation Plan. As part of the current ‘local roots and global branches’ project, the team is working the Kenyan government to help incorporate Blue Carbon and the lessons from MP into the Kenyan Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. Submitted on 28th December 2020, the latest NDC explicitly includes a commitment to harness the potential for coastal carbon PES \(p8\), and to invest in five Priority Adaptation Programmes \(Table 2, programmes 11\-15\) dealing with protection of blue carbon. These important national commitments were all suggested by the research team and link directly to our work. They represent notional investments of up to USD0.88 billion for adaptation and USD1.6 billion for mitigation between 2020 and 2030 \(based on proportional contribution to listed items\) **\[C11\].** MP was explicitly cited by President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2020 as an inspiration for the Kenya 2030 Vision strategy. In recognition of this national impact MP was awarded the President’s prize at the 2017 Mombasa Show. In 2019 it was the first project globally to incorporate seagrass conservation into blue carbon PES and is used by the United Nations as an exemplar and case study for other seagrass conservation projects **\[C6\]**, linked with **\[O2,O4\];** hence the projects are sustainable and expanding. Extensive outreach and press coverage includes a 2019 ‘Ocean Protectors’ documentary by The Economist viewed by over 103,000 people. This outreach resulted in technical assistance being provided for free by the team to another 4 international conservation projects aiming to develop blue carbon PES \(in Mozambique, Tanzania, Indonesia and Vanuata\) **\[C7\].** 

 A new charity \(the Association for Coastal Ecosystem Services – ACES – charity no. SC043978\) was registered in 2013 to provide fundraising, marketing and technical support to MP, VBF and similar projects globally. Since 2017 it has supported the Sankandi Youth Association in the Gambia to plant 20,000 mangroves and establish 80 beehives, with impacts for 3,000 people. MP has been showcased at COP 22 \(2016\) and 23 \(2017\), used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and UNEP as a conservation exemplar and cited in a report used for a Resolution accepted by the United Nations Environment Assembly in 2019.  Results informed a Global Environment Forum project worth USD4.5 million **\[C8\].** In 2017 MP won the United Nations Equator prize as an outstanding example of grassroots action against climate change **. \[C9\]\[C10\]**

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Machine translation \(MT\) is inexpensive, fast, and accessible, but it lacks the reliability of human translators. Sheffield research on quality estimation \(QE\) in MT has enabled the identification of the likelihood of error, allowing MT to be used with greater confidence and underpinning impacts for multiple organisations. Microsoft introduced MT for text strings in program code in 37 languages, allowing more than 20% of translated software to be published without human intervention. Facebook improved its offering of approximately 6bn automated translations per day in >300 language pairs. In addition, the research shaped the latest development of the European Commission Directorate\-General for Translation’s \(DGT’s\) MT system. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the context of the global spread of social media and a global population that is mostly monolingual, MT allows individuals to communicate across language barriers in a way that was impossible a generation ago. Professor Specia’s research established the field of QE for MT *,* with the developed approaches summarised in **\[R1\]**, the only book on the topic, written by invitation for the main book series on natural language processing \(NLP\). Specia developed algorithms to score machine\-translated documents for their predicted translation quality at the word, sentence, or document level. These methods can successfully identify text likely to be ungrammatical and poorly written and text that reads fluently but is likely to contain meaning errors. 

 In 2012, Specia and her collaborators established the Quality Estimation Shared Task \(QuEst\) **\[R2\]**, which provides automatic methods for estimating the quality of MT output at run time without reliance on reference translations. The task has run yearly since. In 2013, Specia published QuEst, the first sizeable research output in the area **\[R3\]** and the first framework released as a tool for MT QE. This framework provided the first language\-independent feature set, which made QE applicable to any language pair and offered sentence\-level quality prediction. In 2015, Specia and Dr Scarton expanded the framework to include word\-level prediction and document\-level prediction by adding novel, appropriate features for these two levels, leading to the development of QuEst\+\+ **\[R4\]**. 

 In 2018, Specia and Dr Blain developed and released deepQuest, a version of QuEst relying on deep learning, in response to new developments in MT software **\[R5\]**. Unlike previous approaches, deepQuest avoids the need for “feature engineering”, thereby providing increased language independence as well as improved performance. Standard NLP pre\-processing is extremely computationally intensive, but the lightweight deep learning approach in deepQuest, called the bidirectional recurrent neural network \(biRNN\) approach, does not require pre\-processing or pre\-training. In 2017, deepQuest was shown to perform on par with the state\-of\-the\-art approach, Predictor\-Estimator, with the advantage that it can be trained in a fraction of the time. 

 Finally, in 2020, Specia and Blain developed and released a new version of deepQuest **\[R6\]**; combining the biRNN approach with state\-of\-the\-art, pre\-trained representations. Their investigation of the new version showed that it allowed QE with unsupervised learning and provided state\-of\-the\-art performance based on current benchmarks.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Sheffield research contributed to rapid improvements in the quality of MT services. QuEst\+\+ gives a reliable indication of probable quality, enabling users to focus efforts more effectively \(reducing time and costs\) and increasing confidence and awareness of quality risks when using raw MT texts. These improvements have led many organisations to use MT as their primary translation method, with human translators performing editing. 

 Microsoft E&D Global 

 In May 2018, Microsoft E&D Global introduced MT with automated QE based on QuEst into software localisation \(i.e., the process of adapting software for a specific region or language, by translating text and adding locale\-specific information\). Although Microsoft was previously using MT for \~75% of their content, its use for software proved more complex, as the risks were greater since functional bugs in a product negatively impact customer experience \(and result in a loss of customers\). By 2019, MT was enabled for 37 languages on 90% of the Office product line. QuEst has allowed Microsoft to publish >20% of machine\-translated word count without review, with no measurable negative impact on customer satisfaction **\[S1\]**. 

 According to Microsoft E&D’s Senior Program Manager, *“The key benefit of this process for Microsoft has been savings of 20% in the cost of human translation and post\-editing, but it has also delivered time savings by removing a stage from the translation and publishing process. With over a million words now published using raw MT across 37 languages, these savings are significant. \[…\] Without QuEst we would not have been able to develop and deploy a quality estimation solution fit for purpose, therefore QuEst was <ins>absolutely fundamental</ins> in achieving the volumes we have managed to reach to date. \[...\] QE provided us with confidence without which I don't think we would have had buy\-in from product owners to start publishing raw MT. If they did approve it, we would have been severely restricted in the volumes we would have been able to publish”. Summarising, the Senior Program Manager stated, “We can safely say that QE gave us a 20\-30% relative gain, in terms of volume of raw MT that we could publish, compared with using other mechanisms”* **\[S2\]**. 

 Facebook 

 Specia collaborated with Facebook within the REF assessment period on research to inform Facebook’s development of prediction models of translation quality. The Research Scientist Manager at Facebook AI explained, “ *Facebook offers its users machine translation of posts into their chosen language. Some translations are shown automatically instead of the original foreign language post – and the decision on which translations are shown automatically is based on confidence level. If our system is confident that the translation is likely to be of good quality then it will be shown automatically – if not, then it will not. Professor Specia’s original research and the software she has been pushing forward \(QuEst\+\+ and deepQuest\) largely set the standard for the area and provided inspiration for the prediction model used to make these decisions”* **\[S3\]**. 

 *“Facebook has set up a research agenda around quality estimation based on her work and in collaboration with Professor Specia, creating new corpora and data sets to increase the coverage of the prediction model from higher research languages \(e.g. German, Chinese\) to lower research languages \(e.g. Sinhalese, Nepali\)”* **\[S3\]**. 

 *“Facebook’s goal is to bring down language barriers and allow people to connect regardless of language. This is an important part of our mission, and we take it seriously. Professor Specia’s research has helped us to achieve our mission by enabling the technology that ensures only the highest quality and most accurate translations are shown to our members. Facebook shows more than 6 billion translations daily in more than 300 direct language pairs, and each translation is accompanied by a quality estimation prediction”* **\[S3\]**. 

 European Commission DGT 

 The research on biRNNs played a key role in guiding the introduction of automatic QE into eTranslation, the MT system of the European Commission DGT. The DGT aimed to improve the usefulness of their services through the QE technology and methods developed in Specia’s research, as the previous quality control system was overly simplistic. eTranslation is both a supporting tool for DGT translators \(who translate over 2 million pages of official documents into 26 languages every year\) and a main translation route for other EU institutions and institutions of its member states \(courts, parliaments, etc.\). eTranslation has been used to translate up to 1 million pages of text in a single day, and usage continues to grow **\[S4\]**. 

 The components of the QE module were successfully integrated, and the module became fully operational and interoperable with the eTranslation system. The Sheffield technology estimates the translation quality from two methods: MT and “translation memory” \(the default method used by the DGT, which employs a database of previous translations\). The likely superior version is then recommended. For other users, each MT includes a quality/accuracy “health warning” based on a range of factors. These warnings allow greater confidence in the translated texts and highlight the areas of greatest risk. 

 The Project Manager for Machine Translation at the DGT stated, *“Without the work of the Sheffield Research Group we would not have been able to contemplate integrating quality estimation functionality into eTranslation at this point in time. Specia worked closely to advise and guide our internal IT and translation experts, including delivering a workshop to our staff entirely devoted to quality estimation. Her influence on our direction of travel and our approach to the development of our software has been fundamental”* **\[S5\]**. 

 A pilot of the module is currently underway. 

 Localisation and translation technology specialists 

 Specia’s work is the cornerstone for QE in MT across the industry. A host of localisation and translation technology specialists worldwide, such as Belgian consulting and systems integration company CrossLang **\[S6\]** and ModelFront \(formerly SignalN\) **\[S7\]**, have been guided by Specia’s research or used her products to develop and benchmark their own product offering. The CEO of ModelFront stated, “ *Specia’s work has defined the category of Quality Estimation of machine translation, and all companies working in this area are indebted to her for her early vision and leading the research community for the last decade. As a dedicated provider of Quality Estimation technology, ModelFront is grateful to her for proving this technology both scientifically and in the eyes of the industry*” **\[S7\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Dora’s research has resulted in vast economic, social, ecological, and educational improvements in Rwenzori, Western Uganda, and established a new sustainable partnership between Mountains of the Moon University \(MMU\) and the farming industry. Following the adoption of his research, the regional dairy sector capacity increased by 75%, and MMU received a full institutional accreditation “Charter” by the Uganda National Council for Higher Education \(UNCHE\). This has led to a substantial increase in the University’s endowment, which now stands at GBP1,300,000, and acceptance of 400 extra students due to additional bursaries worth GBP250,000 being offered. MMU subsequently expanded and, as a result, the cost of surrounding land increased by 1,000%. This all directly benefitted the economy and livelihoods of people living in the Rwenzori region. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Dr Dora specialises in applying lean farming principles in the food supply chain to make it more efficient and sustainable. He was awarded a project on *Strengthening agribusiness value chain through community engagement in Uganda* worth EUR2,900,000, equivalent to GBP2,609,420 \(11\-2020\), in 2013 when he was at the University of Ghent, Belgium and continued the research programme when he joined Brunel in 2015. The 10\-year long project \(2012\-2022\), funded by the VLIRUOS Institutional University Cooperation, focuses on capacity building and institutional strengthening in areas of relevance to farming communities in Uganda, providing a pilot for future farming solutions. 

 When Dr Dora joined Brunel in 2015, he conducted further research on the lean farming component of the project to provide effective solutions for a simplified farming process in Uganda. He applied the ‘lean thinking’ approach—originally derived from Toyota’s model to cut waste and later adapted to develop sustainable global food supply chains—to the Ugandan farmers’ economic system. He developed a Lean Tool Box and Readiness Index and then worked collaboratively with farmers, cooperatives, food processors and suppliers to implement a low\-cost management system for Ugandan farmers in order to optimise their resource management and productivity. 

 Dr Dora has contributed to identifying the bottlenecks in the food supply chain management in Uganda \(especially the small holders’ farmers\) and developed a new collaboration framework and management tools to improve their productivity. His research identified hotspots susceptible to losses and waste along the food supply chain \(Primary production, processing, storage, food service and/or consumption\) \(Ref. 1\). Results further revealed discarding and nutrient loss, most especially at the processing level, as the main forms of loss/waste in food, which were adapted to 4 out of 7 lean manufacturing wastes \(i.e. defect, unnecessary inventory, overproduction and inappropriate processing\). In order to ensure successful application of lean practices aimed at minimizing food or nutrient losses and wastes, multi\-stakeholder collaboration along the entire food supply chain is indispensable. 

 Additionally, his research provided practical solutions for using mobile phones in farming communities beyond just normal communication. Dr Dora conducted a study which looked at the applicability of the technology acceptance model \(TAM\) to the use of mobile phones in farming communities in Sub\-Saharan Africa. Using samples from 300 dairy farmers in Uganda, the research presented in the study contributed to the scholarship on mobile phone adoption in the agricultural sector in Sub\-Saharan Africa and promoted the practical benefits the use of mobile phones can have on the agricultural sector. The majority of farmers only use their mobile phones for personal communication but Dora et al. identified that a change in mind\-set can have a significant impact on their welfare when they learn how to use their phone to market their produce or exchange information on price. The research results therefore revealed the investment and business opportunities that arise when farmers move beyond familiar processes and instead adopt new socio\-economic thinking with technology. In addition, a mobile application “cow analytics” has been developed to help farmers to manage farms and make informed decisions \(Ref. 2\). 

 Working closely with 528 farmers, 1 co\-operative and 2 food processors in 8 districts of the Rwenzori region \(which has a population of approximately 3,000,000\), Dr Dora applied lean manufacturing as a waste management approach and the theory of organisational readiness to change to assess value chain actors’ readiness to adopt measures against losses and wastes. His findings indicate that farmers are unfamiliar with the term nutrition sensitive agriculture, yet they actually know or do what the concept entails. 

 In addition, he found that unmarketable dairy products were often discarded but sometimes donated to charity. Path analysis revealed that change valence and resource availability positively influence change commitment and efficacy, respectively, to adopt lean measures against losses and wastes. Multi\-actor approach only had a positive effect on change commitment but not on efficacy. In summary, value chain actors were optimistic about adopting approaches to reduce food and nutrient losses or wastes as part of nutrition sensitive agriculture. Consequently, external players such as governments, academia and humanitarian agencies need to create sustainable partnerships with the food industry to implement such initiatives \(Ref. 4\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Rwenzori region has vast natural resources comprised of fertile volcanic soils, ample and reliable rainfall, huge tourism potential, water bodies and rich forest cover. Despite its potential and progress, Rwenzori region is still below the national average on a number of social economic indicators. Agriculture is the major economic activity with the majority of the population practising subsistence agriculture. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the region’s population entirely depend on agriculture. Smallholder agriculture production is hampered by challenges related to marketing, lack of agricultural financing, slow adoption of agricultural technologies and practices, and an increasing nutritional challenge among children. The primary reason of food insecurity in this region is mismanagement of resources and lack of knowledge on best farming practices. 

 The Food Supply Management System designed by Dr Dora has benefited not only the farmers in the region who have implemented the system but also its wider community – Rwenzori region – economically by establishing a new sustainable partnership model between an academic institution and an industry. 

 **Increasing Dairy Production and productivity, and improving efficiency** 

 The Food Supply Management System is now successfully integrated with traditional farming in Uganda and has been replicated by farming communities in South Africa and has generated progressive economic, social, and ecological results across communities. Further, the project established and mobilised a dairy stakeholder Platform in 8 districts of the Rwenzori region bringing together 528 famers for an integrated dairy supply chain between 2013 and 2018. As a result, the programme has \(E1\): 

-  Increased milk production and productivity from 10l of milk per day per cow to 22l \[120% increase\]; 

-  Enhanced the dairy market access through the creation of 10 milk collection centres and the installation 10 milk coolers; 

-  Increased the value of the milk by 72% through processing and marketing milk products such as cheeses, bottled milk, yogurt, ice cream and butter; 

-  Increased the regional dairy sector capacity by 75% by mobilizing 528 dairy farmers \[both small, medium and large scale\]; 

-  Created 6 dairy farmers platforms in the region. Platforms are formed in 6 different areas of Rwenzori region to cater the local needs of the farmers. Each platform includes 70 to 80 farmers. 

 This immediate and direct improvement has led to expanding the scope of Dr Dora’s research to benefit a wider society in the Rwenzori region. 

 **Building a Sustainable Partnership between a University and an Industrial Sector** 

 Dr Dora’s research has directly benefited MMU and its community by providing a sustainable partnership model for a community\-owned University to strategically build and use its academic capacity to tackle community issues. MMU, established in 2004, is solely run by the tribal communities, and serves a regional population of approximately 3,700,000 people which expands at a rate of 4.8% per annum \(E2\). 

 The project responds to the needs of the community and is designed to enable MMU, local farmers and residents to solve the problems of the community. For instance, despite the abundance of natural resources and good weather condition, the agricultural productivity of the region is low compared to other parts of the country. Specifically, farmers in dairy sector have low productivity which results in low income and quality of life. 

 On average, a cow in the region produces approximately 4.4l of milk per day \(1606l per annum\). The major factors that are responsible for this low milk production include poor breeds of dairy cows, pests and diseases, poor nutrition and poor management. High cost of inputs, inadequate financial services and low uptake of improved production technologies also contribute to the low milk production in the district. The main concerns of farmers are lack of training on standard dairy farming practices, quality, food safety, transport, and market access. To address these challenges, a modern test farm which facilitates research and development on a variety of subjects such as animal feed, breeding, health, farm management, milking and cooling has been set up. The community\-based skills training and research on integrated dairy chain and Management Systems includes: 

-  Farming practices using lean principles 

-  Pasture management 

-  Supplementary feeding 

-  Feeds rationing and formulation 

-  Milk handling practices 

 Long\-term sustainability, building infrastructure through knowledge transfer 

-  Training programmes were designed as interventions for the farmers 

-  Better feeding 

-  Better knowledge of the market 

-  Better knowledge to increase milk production 

 Dr Dora’s distinct involvement in the project drew from his research expertise in supply chain analysis and improved the quality of training for dairy farming in the agricultural sector of the Rwenzori region in Uganda. Each year, 3 training programmes have been organised on the above topics. As a result of Dr Dora’s research contribution, MMU has been able to train over 500 farmers. The training resulted in 40 to 50% increase in milk production for most of the farmers. 

 In addition, to drive knowledge exchange between MMU and the farming sector, each UG student is assigned a farmer. Farmers share real\-life problems and students research for solutions, benefiting each other. This is a unique and the only model in the world where each student assigned to a farmer to facilitate knowledge exchange. 

 This capacity building project has helped MMU to get a full institutional accreditation “Charter” by the Uganda National Council for Higher Education \(UNCHE\). Having achieved the charter status in 2018, MMU is one of the few chartered universities that are eligible for Government funding schemes. As a result, MMU saw a substantial increase in public funding and now receives approximately GBP1,3000,000 which creates a range of opportunities the University could not access previously. MMU is now able to offer 871 student bursaries and 63 government loan schemes worth more than GBP250,000. This has allowed MMU to start accepting students who previously have been unable to attend University due to financial constraints. MMU has since been able to accept 520 more students and saw an increase of over 400 students in 2019, the year after the Charter. The extra funding also allowed MMU to improve its infrastructure which contributed to an additional increase in student numbers \(E2\). 

 **Contributing to the regional and national economy** 

 In Uganda, over 80% of the population is involved in small scale agriculture conducting mainly subsistence mixed crop and livestock farming on small land holdings \(approximately 3 hectares of land on average\). Agriculture contributes 31% to the GDP and the dairy sector is the second to cereal products contributing over 50% to the GDP of the total output from the livestock subsector. Small\-scale farmers dominate Uganda’s dairy production, owning over 90% of the cattle population in the country. Out of the 96% of the poorer citizens who live in rural areas, approximately 60% keep indigenous cattle. 

 MMU’s significant expansion opportunities have contributed to the development of the local economy. In 2017, the University started to expand and moved their offices from Fort Portal to the town of Saka, acquiring 200 acres of land in the process to establish a Dairy Technology and Innovation Centre. Because of the expansion, Saka has seen a rapid increase in investors establishing hotels, student hostels, restaurants and accommodation to meet the growing needs. The new student accommodation block can house over 1,000 students. Moreover, since 2017, there are 10 additional hostels in Saka and the cost of land has increased by 1,000% because of the presence of MMU: a 15x30m plot of land, which was worth approximately GBP630 in 2005 now stands at approximately GBP6,300 \(E2\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at DMU into the design of clinically meaningful and technically robust quality measures for NHS maternity and perinatal services in Britain has led to: \(1\) better care outcomes for women and babies, including reductions in maternal haemorrhage and 3rd/4th degree tear rates, \(2\) improved maternity data capture and quality for comparative purposes nationally and internationally, \(3\) increased awareness of unexplained geographical variation in maternity care outcomes, which has driven quality improvement strategies, \(4\) integration of research\-based clinical measures into data strategies of the NHS and changes to regulatory and policy processes for maternity care. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Most women giving birth in the UK receive a safe, effective service. However, the stillbirth rate is higher in the UK than in many European countries. There is evidence of significant variation in maternity care outcomes between NHS Trusts in different regions, which has led to concerns over a postcode care lottery for women and babies. 

 Research led by Harris at DMU has used novel methods to identify geographical variations in maternal and perinatal care so that unwarranted variation can be investigated and reduced. This work involved designing clinically relevant measures and being at the forefront of linking established datasets to report maternal and neonatal outcomes. Her studies were carried out as part of the GBP4,000,000 National Maternity and Perinatal Audit \(NMPA\), funded by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership and the first comparative analysis of maternity care across England, Scotland and Wales, for which Harris is Senior Clinical Lead. Novel clinical measures were derived from the use of explicit criteria \(validity, fairness, sufficient statistical power, adequate technical specification\) and balanced to cover various dimensions of care. These methodological approaches were peer reviewed through consultation with clinical researchers and the Royal Colleges; they underpinned the publication of peer\-reviewed clinical evaluations and technical studies, and a cohort study of 276,766 women across 87 NHS Trusts to determine the risk of complicated birth, published in *The BMJ* \[R1\]. 

 In August 2017 the first evaluation of how the NHS delivers maternity care was published \[R2\]. New measures were designed to evaluate variations in the availability, configuration and staffing of services; Harris led on identifying and defining the measures. Significant variation was found in the types of maternity units available to women, with only a fifth of Trusts/​Boards offering the full range of birth settings and there was a wide variation in numbers of beds per midwife. The results provided a baseline for the reconfiguration of services in the wake of government maternity care reviews in England, Scotland and Wales. A second organisational evaluation \[R3\], in 2019, revealed that data from the first study had been used to improve clinical practice and the organisation of care. 

 The first evaluation of clinical outcomes was published in November 2017, based on 696,738 births between April 2015 and March 2016 \[R4\]. Representing the largest ever study of the state of maternity care in Britain, it presented 16 clinical measures of maternity and perinatal care, with each evaluated for feasibility, quality and statistical power. Rates of measures were adjusted for risk factors, such as age and ethnicity. For the first time the study, led by Harris, identified outliers, i.e. units with clinical outcomes outside of the expected range. Key findings, which led to improvements in data collection, quality assurance processes and improvements in care, included: 

-  Significant unexplained variation in rates for maternity process and outcome measures. 

-  Women were twice as likely to suffer postpartum haemorrhage \(PPH\) and severe tears during childbirth in some hospitals. 

-  Wide variation in proportion of babies receiving skin\-to\-skin contact within their first hour. 

-  Significant issues in measuring outcomes due to poor quality data and data missingness. 

 A number of peer\-reviewed research reports were published in 2019/2020 \(and are available at www.nmpa.org.uk\). One of these publications established the feasibility of linking maternity data with intensive care data for the first time, finding that women with a higher BMI, an older age at birth or of black ethnic origin are more likely to require admission to intensive care \[R5\]. Harris led on identifying and defining the clinically relevant measures, which linkage of the datasets made possible. These findings were used to influence the development of new definitions to improve data gathering. The second clinical report, based on 728,620 births from April 2016 to March 2017, was published in September 2019 and included three new neonatal clinical measures and one composite measure: Birth Without Intervention \[R6\]. Harris led on defining clinical measures and identifying the clinical implications of the findings. Media coverage raised awareness of the impact of obesity on maternal outcomes. 

 Further research led by Harris involved the analysis of specific elements of maternity care to further inform care improvements and health policy changes. Harris sought to improve the classification of risk of complicated birth. This study, published in *The BMJ* and shared widely on social media \(reaching an upper bound of 821,000 people on Twitter according to Altmetric\), found that parity and obstetric history are the key determinants of the risk of a complicated birth at term. It demonstrated a need for services to give greater weight to parity in determining risk \[R1\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The collection and analysis of high\-quality linked data, led by Harris at DMU \[C1\], made it possible, for the first time, to compare the care that maternity units provide to women in Britain. The evaluation, the largest of its kind, identified priorities for improvement in care, where unexplained variation in outcomes for women and babies exist, identified areas of good practice and detected gaps in policy and guidelines. Harris led on a strategy to engage the midwifery community in the findings and drive quality improvement with published articles in *Midwives*, the RCM’s magazine \(48,000 members\), and *Midwifery Matters*, and presenting at conferences. Evaluation findings are freely accessible to healthcare professionals, policymakers and members of the public via the NMPA website \(www.nmpa.org.uk\). For the first time, units in England, Scotland and Wales are comparing their risk\-adjusted findings with those of others and against the national mean to take action accordingly. 

 **\(1\) BETTER CARE OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN AND BABIES** 

 The research identified a significant percentage of NHS Trusts/​Boards as potential outliers for one of three measures \(>3 SD above the mean\): PPH \(18%\), Apgar score \(13%\), third\- or fourth\-degree perineal tear \(14%\) \[R4\]. A quarter of all Trusts/​Boards \(38 out of 155\) said they had reviewed their local data following the 2017 clinical evaluation \[R4\] and conducted case note reviews and internal audits \[C2\]. Fourteen services carried out staff training and 21 undertook formal investigations into cases or systems, demonstrating the powerful impact that the research has had on quality assurance processes to drive improvements in care \[C2\]. 

 Fifty\-one services volunteered as case studies to present the work they had done in response to the findings in R4 and the effect this has had on clinical measures. There is clear evidence from testimonials that changes in practice as a result of the research have improved care for women and babies. Northampton General Hospital reports that, following implementation of an action plan, the percentage of women experiencing a PPH of 1500ml or more was reduced by more than one\-sixth, or 0.7 percentage points, from 4.1% to 3.4% by September 2018 \[C3\]. Stockport NHS Foundation Trust implemented the Stockport Perineal Care bundle and reported a reduction in the incidence of severe perineal tears \[C4\]. Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust reported a significant improvement in PPH rates following their response to the clinical evaluation findings, which included improvements in calculating blood loss accurately, documentation and multidisciplinary training \[C4\]. 

 Data collected as part of the second organisational survey \[R3, C5\] found that NMPA data had been used to make improvements in the organisation of care within Trusts/​Boards \(59% of respondents\) in collaboration with Local Maternity Systems/​networks \(32%\). Services also used the data to inform women about their services \(15% of respondents\), to guide local audit \(50%\) and to make improvements to data \(44%\) \[C5\]. 

 **\(2\) IMPROVED MATERNITY DATA CAPTURE AND QUALITY** 

 Many services contacted Harris and other members of the research team to request additional support on how to improve the quality of their data, as a direct response to concerns around missing data that were identified through the research \[R4\]. This led to alterations in data fields in local Maternity Information Systems as well as the flow of data through the local system before reaching national initiatives like the NMPA. Data capture improved from 92% in the 2017 clinical report to 97% for the 2019 Clinical Report with a similar improvement in data capture of individual items \[R4: 11, R6: xi\]. 

 **\(3\) INCREASING AWARENESS OF UNEXPLAINED GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION IN MATERNITY CARE OUTCOMES AND EMPOWERING INTEREST GROUPS TO PUSH FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS** 

 NMPA advisory groups include third\-sector groups and members of the public; advice and support are provided by the Women and Families Involvement Group. The NMPA findings have been published in user\-friendly reports on its website, which are designed to inform women’s choices over where and how to have their baby. The website has seen 10,100 new users and more than 99,000 unique page views\[C6\]. The average time spent on the site is five minutes, with an average of six pages viewed, indicating high levels of engagement with the data. Users are predominantly based in Great Britain \(78%\) but there is significant interest from the USA \(6%\), China \(5%\) and other countries \(11%\), illustrating the data is relevant to the international maternity community. This is supported by the research literature; for example, Souter et al \(2020,  [https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000663696.09421.af](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.AOG.0000663696.09421.af)\) have benchmarked outcome measures in a US birth cohort against those published by the NMPA. The website has seen significant spikes in visitors coinciding with the publication of key reports \(and accompanying media coverage \[C5\]\), with 200% increases in weekly traffic \[C6\]. 

 Both the 2017 and 2019 clinical reports received significant media coverage in the UK \[C5\]. Upon publication of the 2017 findings, the BBC reported on calls from the RCOG to investigate unexplained variation, quoting its president as saying: ‘We urge all maternity units to examine their own results and those of their neighbours both to identify role models and to drive quality improvement locally’ \[C5,p4\]. A *Guardian* article \[C5,p2\] highlighted a finding that fewer than one in six women who give birth every year sees the same person throughout her pregnancy and aftercare, despite promises that this should happen. It quoted a senior policy adviser at parenting charity NCT as saying that the research ‘reveals a number of problems including staffing shortages that puts safe care at risk, and postnatal care that often leaves mothers struggling alone’. 

 The clinical findings published in 2019 \[R6\] reported that the proportion of pregnant women overweight or obese had risen to more than half for the first time \(50.4%\), and increasing risk of miscarriage and stillbirths, was covered widely \[C5\]. *The* *Daily Telegraph* quoted the director of the National Obesity Forum as saying the figures were ‘hugely depressing’ and calling on the UK Government to do more to ensure the risks of a high BMI were taught to girls in schools \[C5,p5\]. The 2019 Clinical Report was widely reported across local news media to highlight regions in which there were concerns around care outcomes. For example, *Wigan Today* reported that women who give birth in Wigan were more likely than average to suffer serious blood loss; it also gave the Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust the opportunity to clarify that the Trust had bettered the national average for 10 of the 13 NMPA clinical outcome measures \[C5,p5\]. 

 **\(4\) INTEGRATION OF CLINICAL MEASURES INTO DATA STRATEGIES AND CHANGES TO MATERNITY REGULATORY AND POLICY PROCESSES** 

 Harris and the project team have worked closely with national dataset teams, regulators, clinicians and service providers to share learning related to data collection and quality. NHS England has acknowledged that the study programme acts as ‘an important benchmark for local areas, helping identify where improvements can be made, including ensuring the right staffing levels for the women and babies they care for’ \[C5\]. Crucially, three of the 16 clinical measures in R4 \(PPH of 1500ml or more, low Apgar score and third/fourth\-degree perineal tear rates\) were adopted as quality improvement metrics by NHS Digital’s Maternity Dashboard, a dataset that helps maternity teams improve their clinical outcomes, and which was set up in 2016 in response to NHS England’s ‘Better Births’ five\-year vision \[C7\]. Study findings have also influenced the development of new metrics for Version 2 of NHS Digital’s Maternity Services Dataset \(MSDS\), a patient\-level dataset that captures information about activity carried out by maternity services in England \[C8\]. Another HQIP\-funded programme is the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK. A November 2019 report from this enquiry endorsed the following NMPA recommendation, which was published in \[R5\]: ‘data gathering on maternal critical illness should be re\-examined and strengthened by new definitions in order to capture lessons about good care and near miss events’ \[C9\]. The research team shared its ‘outlier’ findings with the Care Quality Commission \(CQC\). As a result, CQC uses NMPA metrics in its regulatory process \[C10\]. This ensures maternity services are held accountable for their findings and called to respond as appropriate, with action or justification for results that are unexpected.

#  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers at Queen Mary produced breakthrough algorithms for detecting computational memory violations. Using these algorithms, they developed the program analysis tool Infer, initially commercialised by the Queen Mary spin\-off Monoidics, and since 2013, when Monoidics was acquired, by Facebook. Infer enables highly\-scalable automatic verification of memory violations, which are a major cause of security breaches and operational flaws in software systems. Infer is open source and used by companies \(including Amazon, Spotify, Uber, Mozilla\) and developers around the world. 

 At Facebook, Infer analyses every change of infrastructure and mobile code. Every month, thousands of bugs are fixed before Facebook’s apps \(ie Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus\) are shipped to its 1,600,000,000 users. In the second half of 2017 alone, more than 25,000 bugs reported by Infer were fixed by Facebook developers saving tens of thousands of hours. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Verifying that computer programs correctly and safely manipulate computer memory is imperative, as memory errors can cause operational flaws and have fatal consequences for the missions of systems \(eg safety of a plane in flight\). However, previous program verifiers had only been tested in toy programs of tens or hundreds of lines of code. Large systems need a reliable verifier for hundreds of thousands or even millions of lines of code. The program verifier, Infer, enables this level of verification. 

 Infer is based on research on logics for reasoning about memory use and a type of algorithm that gives partial decision procedures. Two areas of research were brought together to develop ‘separation logic,’ the first effective theory for reasoning about computer memory. Pym and O'Hearn at Queen Mary \(both now at UCL\) brought their research on substructural logic together with joint work \(between researchers at Queen Mary and Carnegie Mellon\) on a type of data and data structure – primitives to describe heap structure – to develop the theory of separation logic. Based on these theories, Distefano, at Queen Mary, produced the Space Invader tool \[3.1\], the first program analyser based on separation logic. Space Invader opened up, for the first time, the possibility of automating the theoretical ideas of separation logic. 

 To move on from the Space Invader tool to automatic proofs that can be used in real\-world industrial code, several steps were necessary. The first milestone was reached when Distefano, in collaboration with Calcagno at Imperial College and other researchers at Microsoft, developed a technique where an analyser can tune the precision of its analysis on\-the\-fly to different data structures of the analysed program \[3.2\]. 

 The second milestone was the development of automatic proofs concerning the use of pointers. Pointers are variables whose value is a location in the computer’s memory. They are one of the major sources of error in memory manipulation in entire industrial programs \(Linux and Microsoft device drivers of up to 10,000 lines of code\) \[3.3\]. After this development, Distefano and researchers at Microsoft introduced a fully automated verification approach for object\-oriented languages using separation logic \[3.4\]. 

 Finally, Distefano proposed the notion of bi\-abductive inference \(a form of logical inference that automates the key ideas about local reasoning\), a breakthrough that allowed partial properties of entire open\-source projects in the hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code to be shown \[3.5\]. To put these results in context, just a few years before, proofs of memory safety had been done only for toy programs in the tens or sometimes hundreds of lines of code. 

 Infer is based on these foundations and was initially commercialised by the Queen Mary spin\-off, Monoidics Ltd, from 2009. Monoidics’ Infer product attracted customers from across the world including government agencies and industrial clients such as Airbus, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and ARM Holdings.

#  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Infer detects memory violations in computer programs with hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of code. Before its development, proofs of memory safety had been done only for programs in the tens or sometimes hundreds of lines of code. 

#  Facebook acquisition of Monoidics 

 Monoidics is a Queen Mary spin out company co\-founded, in 2009, by Distefano, which grew to include offices in the UK, USA and Japan. Monoidics marketed Infer, an automatic program verification tool built on Distefano’s proofs \[3.1\-3.4\]. In July 2013, Monoidics was acquired by Facebook to improve the quality and the security of their code base. 

 Since the acquisition, the development of Infer has been carried out at Facebook, where Infer is now an established technology for software quality. The Facebook code is an evolving system, updated frequently and concurrently by many developers. It is not unusual for more than a thousand modifications to the mobile code to be submitted for review in a given day. Infer reports quickly on these code modifications, in the region of 10 minutes, to fit in with developers’ workflow. Coping with this scale and velocity required the advanced mathematical techniques of separation logic and bi\-abduction provided by Distefano’s research. Bryan O’Sullivan, director of Developer Efficiency at Facebook, said \[5.1\]: “Today within Facebook, the verification technology originally designed by Prof. Dino Distefano and colleagues contributes to the quality of the products we serve to over 2,000,000,000 people every day. Currently Infer analyses every applicable code change within Facebook and its family of apps \(Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus\). Every month, thousands of issues are fixed before these apps are shipped to users. Thus, Infer has saved Facebook engineers innumerable hours that they would have had to spend debugging the problems it detected, had those problems reached production *.*” In the second half of 2017 alone, more than 25,000 bugs reported by Infer were fixed by Facebook developers. 

#  Use of Infer as an Open Source tool 



#  Figure 1: Screen grab from fbinfer.com, showing some infer users. Copyright \[2020\] by fbinfer.com. 

 Infer was open sourced in 2015 \[5.2\].  Since then, it has been used by many companies and developers around the world \(including Amazon Web Services \[5.3\], Uber, Spotify, Mozilla, Sky, Mark & Spencer\) \[5.4\]. Infer is used in diverse ways by these companies: 

 *Facebook and Spotify* use it for user generated content apps, and thus the development of their software as it is continuously released to users. Deniz Türkoglu, Software Engineer at Spotify in 2016 said \[5.5\], “At Spotify we are continuously working on making our codebase better, and in the Android infrastructure team we use a lot of tools: static analyzers, linters, thread/address sanitizers, etc. In our quest to make our code even better, we started using Infer. Infer found several legitimate issues that other tools had missed. Infer is a great add\-on to a company’s toolbox. It’s not intrusive — you can simply add it to your flow and it will tell you where you forgot to close that cursor or leaked that context.” 

 *Amazon and Uber* use Infer for their online marketplaces. Manu Sridharan, software engineer at Uber in 2016 said \[5.6\], ""In 2016, Uber deployed the Facebook Infer tool for static detection of potential NullPointerExceptions \(NPEs\). Alongside our Runtime Annotation Validation Engine \(RAVE\) validation, the tool reduced the number of NPEs observed in our apps in production by an order of magnitude.""

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at the Centre for Biomechanics and Rehabilitation Technologies \(CBRT\) has focused on preventing and treating diabetic foot ulcers. The research has produced impact with new biomechanical assessment protocols for at\-risk patients and with new technologies for prescribing biomechanically informed insoles. Impacts include: 

 **New clinical practice:** Contributed expertise to establish foot\-specific labs at AR Hospitals \(India\) and Koç University Hospital \(Turkey\). Implemented new patient assessment protocols and achieved improved patient outcomes at AR Hospitals, Koç University Hospital, Hospital Militar Geriatrico \(Peru\), and Abbas Medical Centre \(Tanzania\). 

 **New prescription technologies:** Improved, individualised, insole manufacturing at Technofootbed \(Spain\), Cadscan \(UK\), and Podiatry Foot Clinic \(Malta\). Achieved cost savings and improved financial positions for these organisations. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Diabetic foot ulcers are the world’s most common cause of lower\-limb amputations. They lead to around one million amputations annually worldwide. Between 19% and 34% of people with diabetes develop foot ulcers, and these ulcers increase the risk of death after 5 years to 70%. This risk is 2.5 times the risk of death for a non\-ulcerous patient with diabetes. CBRT research focused on new ways to address these problems. The tissue and biomechanical characteristics that make feet vulnerable to ulceration are not well understood. In addition, conventional insoles to protect the diabetic foot from mechanical trauma and ulcers are often prescribed without the clinician considering the individual differences in the way the weight is distributed on the sole of the foot. Seeking to improve treatment outcomes for patients, CBRT has worked with partners to secure almost GBP3,000,000 collaborative funding from the EU, Innovate\-UK and the NHS to conduct the research. 

###  Research into Diabetic Foot Assessment 

 CBRT researchers developed a new, unique approach to using ultrasound elastography to investigate the mechanical properties of the sole of the foot, including its stiffness and thickness. They established that softer heel pads are associated with foot ulceration in diabetic patients \[ **3.1**\]. Further research at CBRT demonstrated that assessing the mechanical properties of an individual’s sole of the foot can improve accuracy in predicting diabetic foot ulceration \[ **3.2**\]. 

 In places where healthcare resources are limited, such as many countries in Africa, where the prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers is high, assessing soft tissue mechanical properties is challenging due to difficulties in getting access to ultrasound elastography machines. To address this challenge, CBRT researchers conducted novel research and established a set of easily measurable parameters, which combine neurological and foot\-specific biomechanical characteristics, to assess the risk of foot ulcers in diabetic patients. They found that clinically viable measurements related to the foot’s neuromechanical aspects, including excessive forefoot load and impaired sensation to touch, can be used to assess the risk of foot ulceration in patients with diabetes \[ **3.3**\]. 

###  Research into Diabetic Foot Insole Prescription 

 Insoles are used to reduce ulcer risk by easing pressure underneath the foot during walking. The systematic review conducted at CBRT revealed a need for an individual\-specific approach to footwear prescription for preventing diabetic foot ulcers \[ **3.4**\]. CBRT research pioneered a systematic approach to insole prescription using a computational method \[ **3.5**\] and validated it using experimental analyses \[ **3.6**\]. The approach uses the patient’s weight to identify the insole stiffness that can best redistribute pressure underneath the foot. This knowledge has led to the development of the Customised Support Structure, which CBRT filed as a patent in December 2017 \(Deformable Support Structure, PCT/ 5170/4243PGB\). In collaboration with Cadscan Ltd, CBRT then developed an ultra\-customisable insole for NHS use. This collaboration won GBP1,100,000 worth of funding \(the University’s share c. GBP160,000\) from NHS England. Initial clinical studies have established the technology’s efficacy in reducing diabetic foot ulceration risk.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has generated impact in two key areas: 

-  CBRT research into *Diabetic Foot Assessment* has directly benefitted a major hospital and its five satellite centres across India, the main Tanzanian diabetic foot clinic, and two major hospitals in Turkey and Peru. They adopted the biomechanically informed assessment protocols developed at CBRT, which led to an improved diagnosis of the foot at risk of diabetic ulcers. The hospitals’ better understanding of diabetic foot ulceration risk factors has benefitted patients and improved clinical outcomes. 

-  CBRT research into *Diabetic Foot Insole Prescription* has benefitted a major Spanish manufacturer of diabetic footwear. This research has led to increased profits at one UK SME. The research has also led to an increase in the number of products, turnover, and profit for a company in Spain. It has lowered costs and improved patient outcomes in a Maltese foot clinic. 

###  4. 1. Improving Diabetic Foot Assessment in Clinics 

 **4. 1. 1. AR Hospitals \(India\)** 

 **Establishing a foot lab:** As part of the 2011\-2015 DiabSmart project, CBRT researchers were instrumental in establishing a foot lab at AR Hospitals in 2014. The Team established the lab’s testing protocol and coordinated selecting appropriate biomechanical tools for purchase. The lab made comprehensive foot assessment possible for all patients \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **New training:** AR Hospitals has five satellite centres in India. There was a general lack of knowledge and experience of biomechanical risk factors for ulceration across these centres. AR Hospitals used CBRT research to provide these centres with new, targeted training. CBRT research that established biomechanical risk factors for ulceration \[ **3.1, 3.2, 3.3**\] formed the basis of this training programme. The CEO of AR Hospitals describes the knowledge transfer process: *‘The collaborative research which revealed the role of biomechanical risk factors in diabetic foot ulceration was used as the basis for the systematic training of 5 of our staff … The knowledge transfer which happened during the project and ongoing collaboration was then transferred to other staff \(circa 80 practitioners\) … This has influenced and provided awareness of the importance of biomechanics within the diabetic foot care provision across all AR Hospital satellite centres which have been treating circa 400 patients each day’* \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **Changes to clinical practice:** This training has enabled these centres to utilise biomechanical assessment in their day\-to\-day clinical practice. An AR Hospitals doctor confirms this improvement in clinical practice: ‘ *research led by CBRT and conducted at our hospital bridged the gap between academic evidence and clinical practice. This has resulted in the assessment of the soft tissue at the sole of the foot to be incorporated in the assessment of the foot for our diabetic foot patients in the clinic*’. The changes in practice led to the establishment of a new role \(headcount 1; FTE1\) in AR Hospitals. The doctor reports: ‘ *One of the key accomplishments of our collaboration was setting up a biomechanics lab in our hospital in 2014. A new foot technician position has been created, with the responsibility for assessing the biomechanical risk factors related to the diabetic foot for patients at each visit*’ \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **Improved outcomes:** The development of a multidisciplinary team for the treatment of diabetic foot disease has improved the quality of practice and patient satisfaction \[ **5.2**\]. The foot lab and training contributed to a more evidence\-based approach to diabetic foot disease diagnosis. They generated measurable improvement in patient outcomes at AR Hospitals, ‘ *Collectively, the engagement with CBRT has influenced a population size of 1,000,000 patients in the geographical area of Chennai of Tamil Nadu and the adjacent states of South India…this could be evidenced through a significant decrease in the number of ulcerations in patients under our care*’ \[ **5.2**\]. 

 **4. 1. 2. Hospital Militar Geriatrico \(Peru\)**New assessment protocols:** The Hospital is a major centre for old\-age care in Peru. The Day Hospital Unit team used the CBRT research to enhance their awareness of tissue mechanics in diagnosis of diabetes complications. The work extended the Day Hospital Unit team’s understanding of the effect of diabetes on tissue glycation and, especially, diabetic foot assessment. Prior to their participation in our study, the Day Hospital Unit ‘ *were not aware of the effect of diabetes on the soft tissue at the sole of the foo*t’ \[ **5.3**\]. **Improved patient outcomes:** CBRT’s ultrasound elastography methods allowed the Day Hospital Unit to provide more evidence\-based assessment and to decrease over\- and under\-treatment of patients. The Hospital reports ‘ *this has led to a stratified approach to assessment and care of diabetic foot in our hospital which have significantly improved our capacity for diagnosing and treatment of patients with diabetic foot disease*’. The collaboration with CBRT has led to significant improvement in health outcomes for diabetic patients, ‘… *all our diabetic patients \(50 per week\) now receive appropriate and related treatment of their feet according to their blood sugar level. This has shown to be effective in decreasing the over and under treatment of patients, and has led to significant saving in the resource at our hospital. We have seen 10% reduction in annual ulceration rate*’ \[ **5.3**\]. 

 **4. 1. 3. Abbas Medical Centre \(Tanzania\)**New assessment protocols:** Abbas Medical Centre operates one of the main diabetic foot clinics in sub\-Saharan Africa, a hub that provides training to healthcare workers in developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. CBRT collaborative work with the Centre \[ **3.3**\] has directly changed their diabetic foot assessment clinical practice. Where the clinic would previously assess many foot\-related parameters, CBRT research led them to focus on specific parameters that are stronger indicators of the risk of diabetic foot ulceration. The Director of Abbas Medical Centre states ‘ *this has resulted in saving an estimated 15 min of appointment time for each patient and … on average has changed from 60 min to 45 min*’. The Director estimates a 20% reduction in ulceration rates ‘ *and significant decrease in the socioeconomic burden of the disease*’ \[ **5.4**\]. **Financial sustainability from Improved patient outcomes:** The changes have led to a priority appointment system for those at the highest risk of diabetic foot ulceration, which has resulted in ‘ *optimised efficacy and savings in \[Abbas Medical Centre\] resources*’, leading to both improved care and financial sustainability. As the Director reports, the research ‘ *has been instrumental in achieving a new standard of care for our patients with diabetes. It has contributed to the present sustainability of our medical centre*’ \[ **5.4**\]. 

 **4. 1. 4. Koç University Hospital \(Turkey\)**New clinical protocols:** In 2018 Naemi designed an audit of diabetic foot patient care at Koç University Hospital. The audit established a need to assess biomechanical factors in diagnosing and treating patients with diabetic foot complications. The Hospital implemented Naemi’s recommendations in 2019. A Hospital practitioner, who sits on the Diabetic Foot and Wound Care Council in Istanbul, explains that Naemi’s work was ‘ *translated into our practice with the endocrine team members \(7 physicians and 2 diabetes nurse\) … being able to use clinically viable methods such as biomechanical assessment to assess the risk of ulceration. This team assesses over 20,000 patients per year. The changes have led to incorporating biomechanics into foot assessment routine at the diabetic foot clinic*’. The practitioner testifies that ‘ *The collaboration with CBRT was pivotal to enhance my team’s research capacity and build our competencies in the area of biomechanics*’ \[ **5.5**\]. **New biomechanical assessment training:** CBRT led research\-based capacity\-building activities to help implement the new protocols. The activities were focused on the role of biomechanics in reducing risk of mechanical trauma to the foot. They were delivered to 20 practitioners, nurses, and doctors who work in diabetic foot care \[ **5.5**\]. **A new foot biomechanics lab:** In 2019, CBRT contributed consultancy and expert advice to set up a dedicated foot biomechanics lab at Koç University Hospital. The lab is equipped with gait analysis and pressure measurement systems for essential biomechanical and diabetic foot evaluation. The lab has significantly improved the capacity for diagnosing and treating patients with diabetic foot disease. ‘ *Despite this being a basic setting, essential biomechanical and diabetic foot evaluation equipment are now used in this lab in our hospital. This has significantly improved our capacity for diagnosing and treatment of patients with diabetic foot disease*’ \[ **5.5**\]. 

 **Improved patient outcomes:** The new protocols, training, and lab have enabled the Hospital’s diabetes team to include range of motion, neuropathy, and foot posture checks into their regular daily clinical assessment. Hospital staff describe ‘ *significant’* improvements in patient outcomes. The practitioner reports that the ‘ *diabetes team now consider measures like range of motion, and neuropathy as well as assessment of foot posture into their regular daily clinical assessment, which has led to significant improvements in patient outcome*’, and that ‘ *Although the improvements were only implemented two years ago, we have already seen more … high\-risk feet without developing ulcers in early stages which is important for diabetic foot ulcer prevention*’ \[ **5.5**\]. 

###  4. 2. Improving Diabetic Foot Insole Prescription 

 A further step after assessment of patients at risk is prescription of appropriate insoles to alleviate diabetic foot problems. Our work has provided this process with new resources: 

 **4. 2. 1. Technofootbed \(Spain\)**Improved insole materials:** In 2015 CBRT research into insole materials selection and weight offloading \[ **3.4**, **3.5**\] led to the diabetic footwear manufacturer, Technofootbed, adopting a superior insole material \(PU\). PU is more durable and shows better cushioning properties than conventional diabetic sandal materials. Sandals with PU insoles last more than a year, compared to conventional diabetic sandals’ six\-month lifespan. Technofootbed now manufactures PU insoles in a systematic, evidence\-based way to ensure their suitability for individual diabetic patients. The CEO states that CBRT research ‘ *has impacted and changed our practice by facilitating evidence\-based manufacturing insoles*’ **\[5.6\]**. **Company growth:** CBRT research has supported Technofootbed’s successful expansion of their product range. Since 2015, their collaborative developments with CBRT have created an increase of 50% in the number of their new footbed/insole products. These products have seen turn\-over increase by EUR300,000. Since the completion of their knowledge transfer work with CBRT, Technofootbed has established a strong diabetic footwear market presence in the UK and in Europe, with a 10% rise in gross profit \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **4. 2. 2. Cadscan \(UK\)**New 3D\-print system for custom insoles**: CBRT research into optimised 3D\-printed insoles \[ **3.6**\] led to a new IP patent application. These insoles assist the treatment of diabetic foot conditions by providing greater comfort and reduced walking pressure for diabetic patients. Since 2018, CBRT has worked with Cadscan, a UK SME, to introduce these insoles into NHS use. With Cadscan, CBRT has developed a manufacturing system to facilitate the automatic creation of these low\-cost insoles that help prevent diabetic foot ulcers. For the first time, the system has allowed 3D manufacturing of fully compliant/soft insoles. Cadscan’s CEO reports the collaboration with CBRT ‘ *has acted as a catalyst leading to a change of direction for the business toward footwear products*’ \[ **5.7**\]. Cadscan now markets 3D\-printed orthotics with the registered trademark ‘Imprints’ \[ **5.8**\]. In 2019 the work enabled Cadscan to win an approximate GBP80,000 contract to supply 1,800 custom insoles to the NHS for use in a trial with diabetic patients in Cheshire and Merseyside \[ **5.7**\]. **Uptake in the NHS:** Cadscan’s CEO reports: ‘ *The 3D printed insoles have been well received by the NHS as a result of their efficacy in reducing pressure underneath the foot during walking. There is currently a trial in progress to assess the effect of these 3D printed insoles in preventing diabetic foot ulceration in a real life setting. This trial involving community foot prevention services located in two CCG areas in Cheshire and Merseyside has shown positive early results*’ and identifies that the work ‘ *can lead to a reduction in the cost of insoles/orthotics by around 10 times per pair*’ \[ **5.7**\]. 

 **4. 2. 3. Podiatry Foot Clinic \(Malta\)**Improved outcomes:** CBRT has collaborated with the Podiatry Foot Clinic to implement our 3D insole printing technology. The Clinic owner, who is also the Chair of the European Network for Podiatry Educators, reports ‘ *we have started using 3D printed insoles within our clinical practice*’ to treat people with diabetic foot conditions, leading to ‘ *significant improvements in patient outcomes*’ \[ **5.9**\]. 

 **Cost savings for patients and service providers:** The Clinic owner reports the technology can mitigate cost concerns. ‘ *Within some of our clinical work*’, he writes, ‘ *we have adopted 3D printed insoles that are more economically viable due to being low cost. The cost of these 3D printed insoles is very low at approximately EUR 50 for two pairs. This is much less expensive compared to the more complex orthotics costing circa EUR 200 each.’* He acknowledges the impact as on\-going, with a *‘significant cost saving for our health services and the patients’* \[ **5.9**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Durham University’s research in marketing and management has enhanced supply chain management \(SCM\) by several UK firms. The impact on these particular firms is important as they comprise a variety of actors including larger firms and SMEs in the manufacturing sector; and thus the benefits they accrue will have further impact on suppliers and customers in their respective supply chains. The impact involves facilitating significant changes in practice to: \(i\) radically improve processes of analysing the marketplace and customer relationships; \(ii\) develop new work practices for managing these relationships, reflecting an improved marketing orientation; \(iii\) improve manufacturing firms’ effectiveness in providing customer value; and \(iv\) develop and implement more responsive operational processes. As a result of the research, organisations have been able to more systematically engage with their supply chain partners and hence improve their performance. The impact has spread from original studies of manufacturing excellence across several organisations to funded projects including a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\) and an ESRC impact acceleration award, thereby combining what was initially a broad level of engagement with more highly focused outcomes. Specific improvements include: better generation of ideas for new product development \(NPD\); greater effectiveness of shared processes across the supply chain; identifying and mobilising partners to contribute value to customer solutions; and the development of a data classification policy which facilitates different supply chain configurations. The impact resulted in significant performance improvements, e.g. for one company, PSP Architectural, turnover increased by approximately 28% and staff headcount by 50% over 2 years. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research that underpins this case study falls into the closely linked areas of supply chain integration and business\-to\-business \(B2B\) marketing. The former refers to the degree to which a manufacturer strategically collaborates with its supply chain partners and jointly manages intra\- and inter\-organization processes; the latter refers to the management of market\-based relationships between organizations, including buying and selling. The research explores how integrating such processes for developing new offerings and planning production can improve organisational performance. 

 During the current REF period, Ellis and Tsinopoulos led a programme of engagement activities which generated impact, through improved business performance, and new research, through the generation of data and business driven research questions. Both the impact and the research focus on the customer and supplier sides of integration, and on the balancing of a strong internal focus \(e.g. on manufacturing processes – R1, R2\) with external awareness \(e.g. the wider industrial network in which inter\-firm relations are embedded \- R4\). The research which underpins the impact falls under three streams. 

 In the **first stream**, the research has compared the integration practices of lead users \(customers with specific needs and innovative skills\) with those of suppliers. Findings indicate that integration with the former is superior to the latter \(e.g. R1 & R3\) and has therefore guided choices on the direction of integration. The **second stream** has examined the underlying dimensions of supply chain integration. It has argued that different combinations of product newness and process structure will determine how a manufacturing organisation will benefit from integrating with customers and suppliers \(R2 & R6\). These two streams are novel due to their combination of the study of supply chain integration practices with those internal to the firm. This has facilitated the explanation of influences on, and barriers to, integration in greater depth than hitherto, including the significance of product newness. Finally, the **third stream** has explored how marketing and purchasing managers in different B2B contexts socially construct boundaries as well as notions of value; and the implications of these constructions for the management of inter\-firm relations \(R4 & R5\). This stream is novel as such relationships have largely been studied from a quantitative perspective rather than this more nuanced interpretive approach. 

 The specific research findings that have led to impact are as follows: 

-  Integration of NPD and production processes between suppliers and customers is multidimensional \(R3, R6\). 

-  The integration of procedures and decision making for NPD and processes that can add value will depend on \(i\) the newness and familiarity of the products and processes \(R6\); and \(ii\) the type of process structure used by the focal organisation \(R1, R2 & R6\). 

-  Managers’ inter\-personal behaviours can help the development of inter\-organizational relationships \(R4\). 

-  The efforts of more peripheral actors beyond the core buyer\-supplier relationship can result in network value creation \(R5\). 

-  Firms should seek to balance external and internal perspectives when developing supply chain strategy \(R4 & R5\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Overall, the impact consists of improvements in the performance of several UK manufacturers through more effective management of supply chain relationships for understanding customer needs, developing new products and improving decision making. Reach and significance of the impact was achieved by engaging with two groups of companies. The first \(project 1\), includes a high number of manufacturers that received detailed research\-led guidance on improving their supply chain integration practices. It includes the manufacturers that participated in the Institute of Mechanical Engineers’ \(IMechE\) Manufacturing Excellence \(‘MX’\) awards \(project 1\). The second \(projects 2 and 3\) includes two organisations with whom the research team engaged closely to significantly improve the processes used to manage their supply chain relationships \(PWS Distributors \(2018 GBP63million turnover\) – see E3 & E9; and PSP Architectural \(2018 GBP9million turnover & 100 staff\)\) \(E8\). 

####  **Project 1 \- Reach: MX Benchmarking project** 

 The ‘MX’ award scheme has served as the basis for increasing the reach of the impact by guiding the change of processes and thus improving the business performance of about twenty UK manufacturers per year \(E1\). MX’s aims have been to: i\) recognise the best manufacturing practices in the UK; and, ii\) improve participants’ business performance by providing detailed world leading and research\-led recommendations for process improvement. Prof. Tsinopoulos has been a key member of the award design team \(2000\-11\) and then member of the executive committee \(2011\-16\) of the awards. He was in charge for the provision of feedback \(benchmarking\) to the participating organisations up to 2016. 

 This has been an iterative engagement during which: i\) Tsinopoulos has used the data submitted by organisations to generate research \(R6\); and ii\) the participating organisations used the feedback to improve how they manage their processes. It is here that we have seen ‘ *the positive impact which this programme has had on the UK manufacturing companies who have participated’* \(E1\). 

 The feedback \(benchmarking\) reports, that all manufacturers received, built on the Durham team’s research and explained what they each needed to do to improve their supply chain relationships so as to enhance their business performance \(i.e. R3 & R6\). For instance, when a manufacturer reported weak integration practices, the report would provide detailed guidance on how to improve them, e.g. by classifying suppliers so as to streamline information sharing and improve decision making \(R6\). Such guidance was based on the second stream of work. Similarly, when a manufacturer reported weaknesses in the generation of ideas, for NPD, the report would provide detailed guidance on how to engage with suppliers and/or lead users to develop product solutions which are technically feasible and marketable. Such guidance was based on the first stream of work. 

 Manufacturers have used this research\-led guidance to improve the integration with their suppliers on the most appropriate dimensions \(E1\). For example, <ins>ZF Lemforder Ltd</ins> \(2018 turnover: USD296million \(12\-2018, E2\)\), who improved their competitiveness by achieving *‘standardisation between our assembly lines, departments and processes’,* both internally and externally \(E4\). These improved practices *have had ‘a direct influence on our quality, cost and delivery’* \(E4\). Since 2017, ZF have worked with a key customer organisation to *‘design the assembly for ease of manufacturer and reduce the risk of mis\-builds*’ \(E4\). Similarly, <ins>AGFA Graphics</ins>, who participated multiple times, \(2018 turnover: USD89million \(12\-2018, E2\)\) have provided clear indications of where the feedback has been used to reduce ‘ *cost and quality risks*’ from holding ‘ *excess material*’ between sites \(E5\). This includes the development of process improvements across the supply chain which led to the survival of a plant: ‘ *without MX participation, the Leeds factory would probably have been closed down’* \(E5\). 

####  **Project 2 \- Significance: KTP with PSP Architectural on the development of closer integration with customers and suppliers** 

 During this Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\), PSP, a Shildon\-based manufacturer of rain\-screen systems and metal fabrications, was provided with ‘ *the knowledge and expertise that PSP lacks*’ \(E6\) to integrate its marketing and supply chain and improve how managers make decisions. 

 The company worked with Profs Ellis and Tsinopoulos to significantly change its processes to better configure its supply chain partnerships \(R4\). This entailed better appreciating where and how value is created across the supply chain \(E6 & E7\). This understanding was based on findings reported in R2, R4, R5 & R6. As a result, the company has been able to identify better product opportunities in its trading relationships and added\-value services \(R5\). This has promoted a more partnership\-based approach to the management of its supply chain, thereby managing its integration efforts more effectively. Resulting strategies acknowledged the significance of customers, competitors and other stakeholders. Indeed, PSP states that ‘ *the biggest impact was on the structure within the company and how we communicate internally and externally’* \(E8\). 

 Prof Ellis and the KTP Associate conducted extensive qualitative research \(underpinned by the methods in R4 & 5\) into managerial perceptions within the construction industry network \(E7\). Based on these studies, PSP set up and implemented processes and systems for customer acquisition and the subsequent management of relationships with the key network actors that contribute to value creation within the sector. This enhanced approach to managing its B2B relationship portfolio included the appointment of new senior personnel with *‘significant experience with project work and a greater understanding of site construction’.* The company states that this has *‘improved both the communication and project control within the business resulting in orders being received regularly from much larger clients’* \(E8\). PSP has also set up a design operation to add value to customers, thus ensuring that the external identity of ‘solutions’ supplier that it was projecting to the marketplace was mirrored by internal practices. By thereby offering a service that many competitors do not, ‘ *this assists significantly in securing projects’* \(E8\). 

 As a result of using improved knowledge of changing customer needs, the transformation in the company’s network positioning, marketing orientation and supporting operations has manifested itself in an increased level of enquiries from potential clients. This has enabled PSP to select higher margin opportunities from a more comprehensive relationship portfolio; opportunities it was better able to serve thanks to closer relations with suppliers. The impact on the company was extensive: sales have increased such that turnover in the year 2017\-18 was GBP9million, from GBP7million in 2014\-15, and staff headcount increased from 66 to over 100 \(E7 & E8\). 

####  **Project 3 \- Significance: PWS Distributors and ESRC Impact Acceleration Account** 

 PWS in Newton Aycliffe is a supplier of kitchen components and work surfaces. Contrary to PSP above, PWS’s products are relatively high volume and standardised, a configuration which dictates a different way of integrating with customers and suppliers. Facilitated by matched funding from the ESRC’s IAA, Prof Tsinopoulos was able to guide the firm in significantly changing its integration practices and in developing and implementing a strategy for business growth. The project applied the findings of his research on supply chain configurations and customer identification \(R1 & R6\) to develop and implement a methodology of proactive information provision and data analysis for the firm. It encouraged the development of a culture of data\-driven decision making which considered modes of supply chain integration on one hand and the way marketing decisions were made on the other, thereby maximising customer value. As the firm puts it, ‘ *This was achieved by implementing product and customer segmentation within a business intelligence \(BI\) system, as identified by a program of engagement with stakeholders*’ \(E9\). 

 They add, ‘ *The project achieved success in allowing individuals to validate their intuitions as a data\-driven assessment via the BI system’* \(E9\), for example in comparing the cost/benefit of a new carrier’s better delivery rate in relation to warehouse work rate and different packing methods. Service improvements were also noted, for instance *‘by adopting a rigorous customer segmentation approach within the warehousing section, customers can receive a service offering which is appropriate for their customer type and position within the supply chain’* \(E9\). This included alternative delivery methods and the need for goods to be labelled and consigned individually, ‘ *including their end consumers’ preferences*’ \(E9\). Moreover, the effects of service changes are more apparent with the improved processes and systems, so that ‘ *when moving a customer onto a premium service method, the effects upon credits can be seen sharply from that point onwards’* \(E9\). PWS believe that the impacts of implementing research findings were seen amongst stakeholders throughout the supply chain \(as suggested by R2, R4 & R5\), for instance in: *‘helping suppliers to optimise their production’; ‘helping increase customer value by enabling carriers to achieve a reduced damages rate’; ‘helping warehousing to function more efficiently’* by examining failure data; and *‘helping customers to increase the value of their business by reducing their failure rates*’ \(E9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Nick Bostrom’s academic research on the dangers of highly advanced artificial intelligence was summarised in his New York Times bestseller *Superintelligence: paths, dangers, strategies* in 2014. The book has sold over 250,000 copies and has been disseminated via a variety of media outlets to over 7,000,000 people online. The impact of this publication, combined with work with researchers at the Future of Humanity Institute \(FHI\), led to changes in public understanding of risks posed by AI, and new policy about future treatment of AI. It has also led to new commercial and non\-commercial policy on safety standards in AI development and deployment as well as the introduction of AI safety as a focus area for philanthropic funding. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Led by and including Prof Bostrom, researchers at the University of Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute \(FHI\) investigated the nature of superintelligent AI systems, how they might help or harm society, and how we should respond. 

  

###  Change in understanding of the ‘control problem’ 

 Bostrom’s 2014 book *Superintelligence* \[A\] has improved the understanding of the ‘control problem’ \(how can we create controls so that machine superintelligence will be beneficial instead of harmful to humanity?\). Prior to the book, there was a distinct lack of rigorous mainstream and academic exploration of the implications of advances in AI and specifically the development of Artificial General Intelligence \(AGI\). *Superintelligence* served to consolidate arguments around the risk of such technologies. It developed many of the core concepts which have come to lay the foundation of the AI alignment field, like the orthogonality thesis \(the assertion that capability and goals of an agent are independent of one another\), and the examination of different types of possible superintelligent systems \(e.g., Oracles, tools\), as well as their associated risks. 

  

 In addition, whereas AI was previously seen primarily as a computer science discipline, *Superintelligence* raised considerations which demanded further engagement from disciplines ranging from philosophy \(e.g., the moral status of digital minds\) and political science \(e.g., how to treat international race dynamics in developing powerful AI; see also \[B\]\) to economics \(e.g., whether an intelligence explosion would lead to Malthusian conditions for the large majority of agents\). 

  

 Subsequent research by Professor Bostrom and researchers at the FHI has built on this platform, focussing on techniques for building safer artificially intelligent systems. Work has included both theoretical \(such as models of causal influence, and the limitations of value learning, e.g. \[F\]\) and experimental \(such as training deep learning models to decompose complex tasks, and to be more robust to large errors\) aspects. 

  

###  Centre for the Governance of AI 

 Established in 2018 and led by Professor Dafoe, this new research centre housed at FHI focuses on the political challenges arising from advanced AI by conducting research on important and neglected issues of AI governance, and advising decision makers on this research through policy engagement. For example, the 2020 report *The Windfall Clause: Distributing the Benefits of AI for the Common Good* \[D\] picks up and extends one of the economic concepts raised in *Superintelligence.* 

  

###  Preventing the malicious use of artificial intelligence 

 A report involving several FHI researchers in partnership with NGOs and other academic partners \[E\] distilled findings from a workshop held in 2017, as well as subsequent research from the authors, to explore possible risks to security posed by malicious applications of AI in the digital, physical, and political domains, and mapped out a research agenda for further work in addressing such risks.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Changed public understanding of risks posed by AI 

 *Superintelligence* has reached over 7,000,000 people. Over 250,000 copies of the book have been sold worldwide, and it has been translated into 31 languages. The book spawned a TED talk with over 4,800,000 views on TED, and over 2,200,000 on YouTube as of October 2020; it was also featured in a profile in the *New Yorker*, and a BBC Hardtalk interview. \[1\] The book has been endorsed by numerous public figures, including Bill Gates and Elon Musk, with Musk saying: 

 “Worth reading *Superintelligence.* We need to be super careful with AI.” \[1\] 

  

 *Superintelligence* sparked a worldwide debate about the dangers of unsafe AI, and motivated parts of the public to change its thinking. Dozens of people publicly claimed that *Superintelligence* has changed their perception of AI risk. Reactions to the book include: 

 “Bostrom has convinced me that once an AI is developed, there are many ways it 

 can go wrong, to the detriment and possibly extermination of humanity“; or “Makes 

 me want to change fields and work on the control problem, given that if this book is correct, it's the single most important problem humankind will ever solve.” \[1\] 

  

 Additionally, the book **inspired the creation of art.** For example, the author Jude Mace wrote about the creation of her book *The Seed of the Violet Tree*: 

 “I had time to read, explore and contemplate the possibilities and risks superintelligence presents to humanity. My interest began after reading Nick Bostrom’s, *Superintelligence: Paths. Dangers, Strategies…*”. \[1\] 

  

###  Changed policy regarding future of AI 

 Nick Bostrom, with other FHI researchers, have informed policy decisions about AI. 

  

 The **UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee recommended a standing Commission on AI** be established. On 24 March 2016, Dr Owen Cotton\-Barratt’s testimony informed the UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee’s recommendation that “a standing Commission on Artificial Intelligence be established…”, which “should focus on establishing principles to govern the development and application of AI techniques, as well as advising the Government of any regulation required on limits to its progression.” \[2, paragraphs 59, 65/66, 73\]. 

  

 The **House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence recommended more funding for AI research** at universities **.** Following testimony from Bostrom on 10 October 2017 and written evidence from FHI, the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence recommended a\) that “the funding for PhD places in AI and machine learning be further expanded” \[3, paras 163, 169\], and b\) that “universities and research councils providing grants and funding to AI researchers must insist that applications for such money demonstrate an awareness of the implications of the research and how it might be misused.” \[3, paragraphs 321, 329\]. 

  

 The All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence recommended placing **more focus on global developments in UK AI policy**. The All\-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence recommended on 30 October 2017 to “commission research or create a forum mapping out the AI global ecosystem and best practices from other countries and intergovernmental organisations”; and to “apply both a national and international lens when addressing AI issues”, both after citing Allan Dafoe stating that “’AI is both. It is an issue on the national and international domain.’ International collaboration is necessary to address many of its issues, but each government must be held responsible for setting the right policy frameworks within its own borders”. \[4, pp 19, 28\] 

  

###  Changes to institutions’ policies on safe and accountable AI 

 Various researchers at FHI, including Bostrom, Dafoe, and Drexler, have worked closely with commercial and non\-commercial partners including staff at Google Deepmind, the G30, the World Intelligence Congress in China, and the Bank of England \[5\]. This engagement has contributed to these institutions’ emerging policies regarding ethical AI. Among other output, researchers at FHI led by Miles Brundage contributed to a report led by OpenAI, one of the largest private AI labs worldwide working on AI safety. Being produced with industry partners \(OpenAI\), the document summarises leading advances in the research into AI transparency, and also **guides AI policies on verification for regulators and companies, including recommendation of stronger third\-party auditing and reporting standards** on AI incidences, **and software mechanisms** like more emphasis on interpretability and privacy\-preserving machine learning. \[6\] OpenAI stated that they will adopt several of the recommendations in their own policies \[7\]. 

  

 Deepmind, a Google division working on advanced AI, acknowledged the value of FHI’s work as well. Discussing a joint Deepmind\-FHI paper on AI safety \[F\], the Deepmind co\-author said of FHI researcher Stuart Armstrong: 

 “It was a real pleasure to work with Stuart on this. … This collaboration is one of the first steps toward AI Safety research, and there’s no doubt FHI and Google DeepMind will work again together to make AI safer.” \[8\] 

  

 **Development of AI safety as a focus area for philanthropic funding** 

  

 *Superintelligence* helped to catalyse a global conversation about advanced Artificial Intelligence, which led to increased funding and interest in the field of technical AI safety, which will in turn give rise to further technological development \(and resultant impact\) over the long term. 

  

 For example, the Open Philanthropy Project \(OPP\), a U.S.\-based grant\-making organisation co\-founded by Facebook co\-founder Dustin Moskovitz, which recommended USD100,000,000 worth of grants in 2018, has committed USD114,813,767 of funding since 2015 for projects relating to potential risks from advanced artificial intelligence'. In their discussion of the reasoning underlying their decision to focus on safe AI as a key area for grant\-making, the OPP recommended reading *Superintelligence* and cited Bostrom’s work throughout. \[9\] The CEO of OPP also explicitly named *Superintelligence* as one of the reasons which convinced him of the importance of risk from advanced AI. \[10\] In a testimonial, OPP referred to FHI as an ‘ *invaluable pioneer and thought partner*’ for their work, that Bostrom’s work had fed directly into their decision making, and that his work on astronomical waste was an important factor in OPP’s early engagement with arguments about long\-run future consequences, where it now concentrates half its funding. \[11\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research leading to the Northern Ireland Model for Shared Education formed an important part of the evidence base for the Ministerial Advisory Group on Shared Education \(2013\). The research directly influenced the statutory duty on the Education Authority to ‘encourage, facilitate and promote’ shared education in the Education Act \(2014\) and, in consequence, the same statutory duty on the Department of Education in the Shared Education Act \(2016\). Our pilot studies influenced the Shared Education Signature Programme \(SESP\) and Collaboration and Sharing in Education \(CASE\) programmes in NI, and related programmes in Israel and North Macedonia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Research by Gallagher \[R2\] and Hughes et al. \[R4\] provided the basis for a model of collaboration between Protestant and Catholic schools in Northern Ireland focused on promoting reconciliation and school improvement. Research on pilot studies involving over 120 schools between 2007 and 2015 led to the development of the Northern Ireland model of shared education \[R3\]. Research led by Hughes has focused on the impact of sustained, regular contact as a mechanism for promoting reconciliation, while at the same time highlighting the need for system level support to maintain reconciliation as a priority goal \[R4, R5\]. Other work has focused on the role cross\-denominational school partnerships can facilitate engagement between communities and a variety of statutory and non\-statutory agencies \[R1\]. 

 Shared Education is now a statutory duty of the Department of Education in Northern Ireland and the Education Authority, and the format pioneered through the pilot programmes has been adopted in the two current official government supported programmes, the Shared Education Signature Programme \(SESP\) and the Collaboration and Sharing in Education \(CASE\) programme. 

 A number of research strands on aspects of shared education have continued and regular briefings are provided to official steering groups as part of the ongoing implementation and evaluation of the initiative. 

 These include in\-depth research into the effects of contact in shared education through a major longitudinal study which has been extended to develop a critique of the underlying purposes of contact in a context of performativity and neoliberal educational policies. There have been a series of qualitative studies providing in\-depth insight into school and classroom practice, including critical examination of how the multi\-strand goals of the model are prioritized. A strand of work on teacher connections using social network theory is leading to better understanding of the dynamics of effective collaboration and to promote sustainability \[R1\]. A series of commissioned studies have focused on issues such as stakeholder views on the optimal means for mainstreaming shared education, evidence on the school improvement processes and the evaluation of professional development networks. 

 International interest in the NI Model of Shared Education has led to a range of comparative studies, including work on the challenges and opportunities of policy transfer of the model to other divided societies \[R6\]. We have also examined the importance of institutional support at school, policy and political levels across different jurisdictions in order to identify forms of leadership that are most likely to promote transformational change in local policy and practice \[R5\]. This work has focused on countries where the NI Model of Shared Education has been adapted for local implementation, such as Israel, North Macedonia and the cities of Jerusalem and Los Angeles, or in other jurisdictions where it is being planned for implementation.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact of this research reported has led to the adoption of Shared Education as a statutory responsibility for the Department of Education in Northern Ireland and the Education Authority. In addition the NI Model of Shared Education has been adapted for implementation in other divided societies most notably Israel and North Macedonia. 

 Throughout the research and development work on school collaboration the research team carried out a high level of engagement with political, policy, education and community stakeholders to ensure they had access to accurate information on the rationale, purpose and outcomes of the work. This engagement included the provision of regular formal and informal briefings for politicians and policy\-makers, and formal presentations to meetings of the Education Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Evidence from the research informed the work of the Ministerial Advisory Group on Shared Education \[CE1 especially pps 49\-56\]. 

 In 2014 an Education Bill was introduced to establish a new Education Authority. An Independent MLA, John McCallister, approached the research team for advice on proposing an amendment to the Bill which would make it a statutory duty of the Education Authority to ‘encourage, facilitate and support’ shared education \[CE2\]. As outlined in his corroborating letter, he felt this would command widespread support in the Assembly which proved to be the case and the amendment formed part of the Education Act \(2014\). The 2014 Act required later legislation, the Shared Education Act to provide a legal definition of shared education, and also extended the statutory duty to the Department of Education. In his supporting letter John McCallister says that he proposed the amendment because he thought, ‘the idea of schools working in partnership across the religious divide in Northern Ireland was a practical and innovative approach to a long\-standing challenge.’ 

 The most recent annual report from the Department of Education to the NI Assembly  \[CE3\] shows that there were 75 pre\-schools, 500 \(63%\) primary schools, 129 \(69%\) post\-primary schools and 21 \(54%\) special schools in Northern Ireland involved in shared education partnerships, with a total of 87,385 pupils involved overall. In addition, independent analysis highlights the positive impact of shared education \[CE4 and CE5\]. 

 The outcomes of the pilot programme has leveraged additional funding of GBP25,000,000 to support the Shared Education Signature Project \(2014\), GBP500,000,000 from the Fresh Start negotiations \(2015\) for the Shared Campuses programme, with an investment of GBP500,000,000 to support capital developments and €35.3m from the European Commission Peace IV programme \(2017\) to support the Collaboration through Sharing in Education \(CASE\) project \[CE6\]. In his supporting letter the CEO of Atlantic Philanthropies, one of the primary funders of the research, describes the shared education journey as ‘quite remarkable … \[moving from\] a theoretical concept to now being part of how hundreds of schools in Northern Ireland do their business.’ 

 Queen’s works closely with the Center for Education Technology \(CET\) and the Abraham Fund in Israel. CET has run three major shared education programmes, with funding support of over USD2,300,000, working with almost 130 Jewish and Arab schools \[CE7\]. CET and the Abraham Fund secured funding of USD1,200,000 and extended this work to 40 schools in the Northern region of Israel. All of these programmes have included teacher exchanges with Northern Ireland organised through Queen’s to support shared learning. 

 The Education Authority in Jerusalem has sent four annual cohorts of principals from Jewish, Orthodox Jewish and Arab schools in Jerusalem to spend week\-long study visits to Northern Ireland to participate in Queen’s seminars and visit Shared Education school partnerships \[CE8\]. As the Deputy Head of the Education Authority in the Jerusalem Municipality says in his supporting letter, ‘we have learned that this model \[for shared education\] is extremely effective \[and weas identified as providing\] a platform that would prtomote an optimal dialogue between Jewish and Arab students.’ 

 Since 2013 Queen’s researchers have made fourteen study visits and run three virtual seminars between Northern Ireland and Israel, involving academics, teachers and policy\-makers. Working relationships have been established between academics in Queen’s and Tel Aviv University and a host of Israeli teacher training colleges. 

 Since 2013 there have been eight exchange programmes between Queen’s and countries in South East Europe. In the Republic of Northern Macedonia Queen’s researchers supported the development of eight pilot school partnerships in separate schools attended by Macedonian or ethnic Albanian children. Relatedly, work between Queen’s and early years’ educators in the Republic of Northern Macedonia led to the development and dissemination of teaching resources to all early years’ facilities. Global Challenges Research Funds \(GCRF\) have supported capacity building programmes in South East Europe from 2017 onwards, including ‘Demonstration school partnerships’ in Northern Macedonia have been matched with school partnerships in Northern Ireland \[CE9\]. 

 In 2019 Queen’s University was awarded a Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education for its work on shared education and the impact of this work in Northern Ireland an internationally. The submission which achieved the award includes letters from a host of principals and international figures on the impact of the research on their work \[CE10\]. The Prize was presented by His Highness Prince Charles at a ceremony in 2020 in Buckingham Palace and received by Professor Ian Greer, Vice Chancellor of Queen’s, and Professor Joanne Hughes, Director of the Centre for Shared Education.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Leoni’s research on the art and material culture produced in relation to Islamic occult practices \(i.e. divination, amulets, etc.\) resulted in a loan exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum which was the catalyst for a fresh public debate on Islamic spirituality and culture. The exhibition engaged diverse audiences \(young adults; BAME; local communities; national and international visitors; regular and occasional museumgoers\) and broadened interest in Islam and Islamic culture both within and outside the museum. The project also generated a number of significant personal, professional and economic benefits which affected the social, cultural and curatorial spheres both locally and nationally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In recent decades Islamic occultism has transformed from a marginalised subject to a burgeoning field of research. Text\-based studies remain prevalent, however, ignoring the fact that being action and purpose\-driven, occult practices cannot be fully understood without considering their material tools and end products. The research project Leoni led beginning in 2013 chose to concentrate on the visual and material evidence produced by well\-documented divinatory arts – astrology, bibliomancy \(divination with books\), dream interpretation, geomancy \(divination with sand\), and lettrism \(divination with Arabic letters\). Between 2015 and 2018 this University of Oxford\-based project received the support of the Leverhulme Trust and the Barakat Trust, the contribution of an early career research assistant \(Dr Farouk Yahya\) particularly through research around the Southeast Asian Islamic occultist tradition and curatorial support, and the advice of an international advisory panel of 8 scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds from the University of Oxford, British Museum, University of Texas at Austin, University of Bonn, Warburg Institute and the University of South Carolina. 

 The key research questions explored were: What kind of objects have Islamic divinatory practices produced in the pre\-modern period and what is their make\-up? What do these objects tell us about their associated methods and their reception and how does this information compare to what we know from historical and technical literature? How does material evidence enrich our understanding of the nature and status of divination and its relationship with canonical religious practices in pre\-modern Islamic societies? 

 These questions were approached through direct object analysis, contextual study of both primary and secondary sources, and subject\-specific conversations in the form of roundtables, workshops, and an international conference \( *Islamic Occultism in Theory and Practice*, 6\-8 January 2017, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford\). These resulted in a number of publications which offered the principal channel for academic dissemination \( **R1\-R4**\). 

 The research concluded that: 

1.  Material evidence is essential for a systematic assessment of occultist knowledge as it both completes and extends what we know from written sources; 

1.  The materials and decorative make\-up of the objects, not always documented in texts, were instrumental for their efficacy and potency and thus require careful analysis and systematic recording; 

1.  The selection and combination of materials and formulas often point at the complex cosmological and philosophical ideas underpinning prevailing Islamic occultist theories, confirming the latter’s pervasiveness and intellectual relevance; 

1.  The merging of formulas generally labelled as “acceptable” \(i.e. pious invocations and motifs\) and “illicit” \(i.e. magical texts and symbols\) on many of the examined objects does not simply constitute a strategy to mitigate theological and juridical objections, but reflects, in fact, a different understanding of their respective spheres and associated powers; such an understanding is one that ultimately assigns a positive role and a status to occult sciences and their methods within a unified vision of the universe emanating from God; 

1.  Practice\-based evidence, including material culture, can help us to challenge polarising ideological stances and dominant assumptions, especially when concerning ideas and experiences of belief in the Islamic sphere; a more nuanced knowledge of the latter facilitates debate and interaction, contributing to improve mutual understanding and acceptance. 

 Generally criticised and disavowed, divinatory and amuletic practices, along with their material expressions, have coloured and continue to inhabit everyday existence within various Muslim societies, intertwined, as they are, with canonical forms of piety and devotion. Thus, a better understanding of their cultural significance and logic ultimately provides the ground for a more complete and less biased appreciation of Islam’s multifaceted nature.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Wider public engagement with the research project outlined above was generated through a large\-scale exhibition \( *Power and Protection: Islamic Art and the Supernatural* \[Ashmolean Museum, 20 October 2016 – 15 January 2017\], **R5**\), complemented by interactives \(e.g., a micro website and sound\-cloud recordings with curatorial comments, **E6**\) and an exhibition catalogue. By offering an accessible and visually engaging entry to a complex and contested topic, the objects selected for the exhibition \(e.g. mechanical instruments, specialist treatises, talismanic garments and weapons, amulets, etc.\) stimulated discussions about the cultural diversity of Islam both within the museum, as documented by visitors’ exit questionnaires \( **E1\-E2**\), and beyond it, as reflected by people’s engagement through social media and blogs \( **E5\-E6**\) and by colleagues in the heritage sector \( **E7\-E8**\), as further detailed below. 

 **1\) Improvement in UK public understanding of Islam and Islamic culture:** 

 While headline news about Islamic terrorism and Islamic State were on the rise prior to and during the exhibition run, the choice of the Ashmolean Museum to propose a different conversation on Islam was valued by its public, thereby **creating an opportunity to broaden current knowledge of Islamic culture** \( **E1\-E2**\). In particular, its diverse audiences appreciated the richness and range of the exhibition’s contents \(a “massive culture – made me aware of holes in knowledge about Islam” as noted by one 16\-24 year\-old male\) \( **E1**\); the discussion of enduring misconceptions about Islam and Islamic art; and the tactful handling of a difficult topic \(“controversial issues addressed in a non\-controversial way”, as observed by one 45\-54 year\-old female, **E1**\). As such, the project created **an opportunity to widen interest in Islam amongst the museum’s stakeholders including Oxford’s various Muslim communities**, as further demonstrated by its endorsement by some of its most prominent members \( **E3**\). In the words of the Founder of educational interfaith charity The Oxford Foundation, “In sharing this aspect of the Islamic tradition – one that is common across many different religions – at a time of such misunderstandings about Islam … this exhibition will help to deepen and enrich people’s appreciation of our faith” \( **E3**\). 

 49% \( **E1**\) to 59% \( **E2**\) of the visitors also felt that by addressing the diversity and complexity of Islamic culture, **the exhibition affected their perception of Islam**. Many were surprised to learn about this tradition’s engagement with the occult and saw their assumptions challenged about what Islam tolerates or not. One 65\-74 year\-old visitor stated that the exhibition was “an eye\-opener, especially the similarities of Islam with other religions” \( **E1**\). This sentiment was echoed by another 35\-44 year\-old female respondent who considered it “a great counterbalance to current discourse on Islam as rigid” \( **E1**\), fulfilling the project’s aim to counter negative presentations of Islam in UK public discourse and promote a deeper understanding of it. Indeed, for 65% of those interviewed it was the opportunity to learn more about Islam that prompted their visit to the exhibition. A total of 85% of attendees further indicated that they would continue to broaden their knowledge of Islamic culture by attending similar events \(61%\) along with travelling \(37%\) and reading \(35%\) \( **E1**\). Even Muslim visitors remarked on how their knowledge changed as a result of visiting the Ashmolean exhibition. Significant in this respect was the comment of a 16\-24 year\-old male visitor who noted “I saw a shape I didn’t know about – sandals of the Prophet; am a Muslim, and am aware of the topic” \( **E1**\). 

 The exhibition was referenced at least 68 times in national and international press \( **E4\-E5**\). Media drew attention to the topic’s complexity and appeal and to the extent to which **the exhibition contributed to challenge conventional ideas about Islamic culture**. Rachel Campbell\-Johnston \( *The Times*, **E4.1** *\)* observed that it “puts firmly to bed the assumption that Islam banned all figurative art,” one of the most ingrained misconceptions associated with Islamic visual culture and one that has polarised public opinion since the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taleban in 2001. Similarly, Sameer Rahim, in the online blog of *Prospect Magazine* \(a leading online platform featuring independent thinking on contemporary issues\) highlighted **the value of object\-based evidence in order to capture the complexity of Islam**:* “Modern\-day rationalists may dismiss such beliefs as mere superstition; many modern\-day Muslims, who prefer the streamlined purity of text\-based religion, will see it as misguided or even heretical. Both miss the point. Such objects offer a window onto the common experience of a culture” \( **E4.5**\). This confirmed the benefits of using material culture and a space like the museum **to stimulate debate and inspire deeper cultural understanding.** 

 **2\) Increased museum attendance and participation of under\-engaged groups and occasional audiences:** 

 The exhibition was visited by 13,306 people and was **particularly** **attractive to various under\-engaged groups \(i.e. students and young adults\).** More specifically, attendance by local community members was 10% higher than Ashmolean general attendance in FY 2016/17 \(35.56% compared to 25.87%\); the young adult audience \(16\-24 years old\) was also greater than the annual average \(22.5% compared to 16.7%\) and more than 3 times the national average \(6.2%, Taking Part Survey 2015/16, or 6.7%, Taking Part Survey 2016/17\) \( **E9**\). BAME \(Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic\) visitors also made up a higher proportion of the audience than the Ashmolean annual average \(14.38% compared to 10.23%\) and considerably higher than the national museums average \(6.58%, Taking Part Survey 2015/16\) \( **E2, E9**\). Furthermore, the proportion of Muslim visitors \(9.6%\) was higher than Oxford’s Muslim population as a whole \(6.8%, UK Census 2011\), and Muslims formed the second largest religious group to attend the exhibition \( **E2**\). 

 Members of the different **Oxford Muslim communities** \(i.e., Muslim students and members of Oxford’s central mosque\) were active contributors to the project \(i.e., contents, marketing, title and overall tone of voice\). Some **proposed and helped to develop new gallery resources.** This included readings of the Qur’an in the gallery by the Imam of the central mosque, which added nuance and credibility to the practice of using this text for healing as much as devotional purposes. Additional help with visitor evaluations enabled others to nourish their interest in museum work. The involvement of an Iraqi refugee with *Power and Protection* and other Ashmolean initiatives resulted in **additional professional development** **and a career move to the University of Oxford’s History of Science Museum** as Collection Officer for Multaka Oxford \( **E7**\). The project therefore **created concrete opportunities for interfaith and cross\-cultural collaboration and for a more inclusive and dynamic curatorial experience**, one replicated in subsequent Ashmolean projects, from the 2018 exhibition *Ibrahim El\-Salahi: A Sudanese Artist in Oxford* to the ongoing redevelopment of the Ancient Near Eastern Gallery, both of which have broadened the participation of relevant local communities of users. 

 **3\) Cultural transformation in the heritage industry:** 

 A further, important effect of Leoni’s project can be traced in the heritage sector. In the recent redevelopment of the Islamic Galleries of the British Museum in 2018, objects associated with divinatory, healing and protective practices became the focus of a dedicated new space. As stated by the then Phyllis Bishop Curator for the Modern Middle East at the British 

 Museum, “Dr Leoni’s project strengthened my resolve to curate an entire case in the new gallery dedicated to the subject” \( **E8**\). The exhibition catalogue produced for *Power and Protection* was also used by the Curator to address the concerns of British Museum visitors, thereby proving useful as an educational tool in other museum settings. As noted in their letter, the Curator is now planning to incorporate the occult in their future reinstallation of the Islamic collections at the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada, where they are now Curator of Islamic Art & Culture \( **E8**\). These initiatives reveal **a growth in confidence in the curatorial and professional sphere in addressing a contested topic in the public space,** **in addition to an increased recognition of these experiences as integral to Islamic culture**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Meek’s research on sport and physical activity in prisons resulted in policy change and improvements for the 80,000 adults and children held in English and Welsh prisons. Her research led to a new cross\-government Sports Forum, an audit of every youth prison and the development of a physical activity strategy for women and girls in custody. Meek’s research facilitated sporting bodies to work in prisons and empowered prison staff to improve physical activity provision. She has given evidence to major government inquiries, prompted the UN resolution on the use of sport to reduce youth crime, and instigated transnational prison sport initiatives. The research has stimulated widespread coverage in national and sports media. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 With a prison population of 80,000, England and Wales have one of the highest rates of incarceration in Western Europe. However, over half of adults and over 70% of children released from prison will reoffend within a year and the total annual estimated economic and social cost of reoffending is GBP18,100,000,000. Working with people in prison and tackling reoffending is one of the biggest challenges our society faces. Professor Rosie Meek’s research demonstrates that sport and physical activity have a unique and important – yet often overlooked \- role to play in responding to this challenge. 

 Research led by Meek has explored the rehabilitative potential of sport and physical activity as a crime prevention technique, demonstrating that sport can offer an alternative means of excitement and risk\-taking to that gained through engaging in offending behaviour. It can provide access to pro\-social networks, positive role models, and offer the opportunity to gain new experiences and achievements. Sport and physical activity can be a positive, cost\-effective and healthy leisure activity representing an alternative to offending which not only has intrinsic value but also provides a relatively easy way to establish a more positive self\-identity and support desistance from crime \(R2, R6\). Meek’s research showed that women and girls in prison are significantly less likely to participate in sport and physical activity than their male counterparts, demonstrating a monthly average participation in physical activity of only 48% of women in prison, with some women’s prisons recording participation as low as 29% in a month \(R3, R4\). It also confirmed that despite an expectation that those held in custodial settings should have the opportunity to be physically active, most prison establishments fail to meet minimum standards in this domain and sedentary behaviour in prisons has consequently been identified as a high\-risk health behaviour \(R1, R3\). 

 Access to and uptake of physical activity and sports based interventions have been shown to improve health and wellbeing, support prisoners’ attitude change and the development of life skills and foster relationships that inspire and motivate adults and children, including those with complex offending histories and challenging and disruptive behaviour \(R5, R6\). 

 Since 2013, research into physical activity and prisoner behaviour has identified the following key findings: 

-  Health promotion and wellbeing of prisoners with a particular focus on the types of activity which have the greatest impact \(team\-based\) and in what capacity/context \(adopting a collaborative approach based on choice and diversity of offering\); 

-  The sport and fitness sector being a route into further education and employment for young people and adults in the Criminal Justice System \(for example as personal trainers, coaches and mentors\); 

-  The manner in which sport and physical activity can be used as a violence reduction strategy in prisons and a way of improving relationships between staff and prisoners and between different groups of prisoners. For example, Meek demonstrated an 83% reduction in incidents of violence among detainees at HMP High Down who took part in their community\-led table tennis programme; 

-  An increase in the number of transferable skills, including communication, goal setting, fostering enhanced interpersonal relationships, prosocial behaviour and the regulation of emotions; 

-  Changes in staffing structures, resource allocation and partnership arrangements between prisons, community groups and sporting bodies to bring about reforms and best support efforts to reduce reoffending. 

 Collectively, this work has led to the increased adoption of sports\-based interventions and evaluations in prison settings, enhanced prison staffing and targeted governance to support effective sport and physical activity in prisons. This includes better sports and Physical Education resources in prisons, a heightened awareness of the importance of access to physical activity in prisons, and a greater commitment to the development of prison\-community partnerships that draw on sports initiatives in efforts to reduce reoffending.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Drawing on her extensive academic research, Meek’s independent review ‘A Sporting Chance’ was undertaken on behalf of the Ministry of Justice in 2018, in order to improve sports and Physical Education \(PE\) provision in prisons, young offender institutions, secure training centres and secure children’s homes throughout England and Wales. Good practice examples were identified and the findings informed a dozen recommendations, 11 of which were accepted by government and have subsequently shaped national policy and practice \(E1\). The key areas of impact resulting from this body of work are as follows: 

 **Enhancing prison governance and staffing to support the effective use of sport and physical activity in prison.** 

 Meek’s research has directly influenced the work of the Ministry of Justice and HM Prison and Probation Service \(HMPPS\), and shaped daily practice in all 122 prisons across England and Wales. There is now a greater recognition and understanding of the role of sport by prison managers and staff, and the profile of sport and physical activity in prisons has been elevated across the prison staffing structure. Job descriptions for prison PE staff have been adapted to reflect Meek’s recommendation that staff engage more closely with community organisations in supporting prisoners to prepare for release. 

 Meek’s work is cited in two key HMPPS operational documents, the 2019 *Strategic Review of Physical Education in Prisons* and the 2018 *Model for Operational Delivery: Young Adults \(18\-25\).* Alongside leading the 2018 independent review on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, Meek’s research featured in the Digital, Culture, Media & Sport Committee inquiry, their 2019 report \(E1\), and in a further ten citations in Hansard parliamentary debates since December 2017 \(E1\). 

 \[text removed for publication\], at HMPPS confirmed in November 2020 that \[text removed for publication\]. Specifically, the resulting governance included a joint action plan between HMPPS and the Youth Custody Service, with the creation of local action plans to address the Review’s recommendations: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). In addition, the governance recommended the creation of the *Sports Forum*: a strategic, cross\-government approach, bringing together Sport England, the NHS, the Home Office and Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). 

 **Improving outcomes for children and preventing youth crime** 

 Meek’s research has been instrumental in improving health and educational outcomes for the 650 children in custody in England and Wales, through improving access to and better integrating sport and physical activity in youth custody settings. Her 11 adopted research recommendations have been integrated into the way that the Youth Custody Service awards tenders for externally contracted work  Overseeing these reforms, Rob Lawman, Senior Policy Advisor in the Youth Justice Policy Team confirms: *“Rosie's piece of work raising the profile of this agenda of youth custody shouldn't be underestimated”* \(E3\). 

 This development has been driven by a commitment from prison leaders to adopt Meek’s recommendation that physical activity and sports\-based interventions are more effectively used to support the most vulnerable and excluded children in our youth justice system: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). On improving outcomes for children in prison, Novus, the educational provider for 570 children held in youth custody establishments within England, confirm that Meek’s research has led to the development of a new specialist post within the staffing team, who has full time responsibility for Sport and Enrichment Coordination \(E6\). 

 This work has also improved access to physical activity for young people at risk of engaging in crime. Meek was the sole academic representative to lobby for better access to sports facilities for socially excluded youth, which was subsequently incorporated into the Conservative manifesto for the 2019 General Election. Huw Edwards, CEO of UK Active testifies that: “ *Rosie’s influence on the framing and engagement of that agenda has been huge… Rosie’s influence on opening up schools and public facilities to lower\-income families and at\-risk young people has also led to practical interventions on the preventative side of criminal justice* \(E7\). Specifically focusing on improving access and outcomes for the BAME children who now represent more than half of all children in youth justice settings, Meek’s work has resulted in the funding and delivery of new initiatives that seek to tackle disproportionality in justice settings: 

 *“Recommendation 8 …led to our launching the £1.7m Levelling the Playing Field project in January 2020 alongside the Youth Justice Board”* \(E4\). 

 Meek’s research has also been instrumental in developing international use of sport for youth crime prevention. Her work with the UN Office for Drugs and Crime \(UNODC\) led to the 2019 adoption of General Assembly resolution 74/170 entitled “Integrating sport into youth crime prevention and criminal justice strategies”. The UNODC have confirmed that: \[text removed for publication\] \(E5\). 

 **Increasing physical activity and improving conditions for women and girls.** 

 Meek’s research highlighting the low rates of physical activity for women and girls and the gendered barriers to engaging in physical activity in prison has led to improved conditions for women and girls in England and Wales, including the construction of a dedicated strategy, the procurement of women’s PE clothing and targeted interventions and programmes: \[text removed for publication\] \(E2\). 

 Focusing specifically on the small number of girls in custody, Novus has provided a clear link between Meek’s research calling for a trauma\-informed approach to working with girls and engaging more effectively with this under\-served and vulnerable group: *“With boys making up the majority of learners at Rainsbrook \[Secure Training Centre\], girls had previously been left behind and put off sport for a variety of reasons. Now, we have sought the girls’ feedback about what they want and have initiated specific girls’ gym sessions, as well as dance and netball”* \(E6\). 

 **Establishing relationships between prisons and community groups.** 

 As well as facilitating prison staff to engage in more community partnership working, Meek has addressed the All Party Parliamentary Group for Sport and used her research findings to support a broad range of voluntary, community and sporting organisations \(including UK Coaching, England Boxing, Table Tennis England, parkrun, UK Active, the Change Foundation, and the Youth Sport Trust\) on the use of sport and physical education in prisons and in reducing crime. Her research findings have been instrumental in establishing relationships between prisons and external providers, leading to the delivery of new initiatives that support people in prison and after release from custody: “ *Rosie’s recommendations in this area have given us personally the opportunity to open up those conversations and we’ve found prison staff more receptive as a result”* \(E6\). Meek’s research has been instrumental in enabling sporting organisations and bodies to deliver programmes in Criminal Justice settings for the first time, as demonstrated by the CEO of UK Active, representing their 4,000 members: “ *We now have partnerships and projects in place, and many ongoing conversations taking place investigating those two key areas from Rosie’s Review that are relevant in our area \- raising physical activity levels and developing employment opportunities post\-release. That narrative wasn’t on the radar of my membership prior to our engagement with Rosie*” \(E7\). 

 In turn, her work has also led to prison education providers engaging directly with sporting bodies: *“We are now empowered to approach local organisations and national governing bodies as the examples cited in Rosie’s report provide all the evidence we need to prove the potential benefits of them getting involved… these fruitful partnerships are what will leave a massive ‘Rosie footprint’ all over the prison estate. It will be her legacy”* \(E6\). 

 In providing the theoretical framework and evidence base for organisations to deliver in criminal justice settings, the research has led to sustained impact in the sports for development sector. Brighton Table Tennis Club and Richmond RFU have enacted programmes using Meek’s research as a ‘way in’ to prison settings. The Head of Community Rugby at Richmond Rugby states *“... we thank Rosie for providing the evidence base which laid the platform for our holistic programme to flourish”* \(Head of Community Rugby, Richmond Rugby\) \(E10\). 

 As well as empowering organisations around the world to develop an evidence\-based approach to using sport as a crime reduction technique, Meek was also a key figure in the establishment of the Alliance of Sport in Criminal Justice, a charitable organisation with a global membership of over 400, *“It’s fair to say that the Sporting Chance Review has positively impacted on the work of all these members. It’s changing the game for sport in criminal justice in so many ways*” \(E4\). With further global reach, Meek’s work has been critical in the development of parkrun in custodial settings, an initiative promoting health and wellbeing, as confirmed by World Champion Triathlete Chrissie Wellington, Head of Health and Wellbeing at parkrun: “ *We drew heavily on her research to inform the development of this initiative, and its evaluation… To date, parkrun events have been set up on over 30 custodial sites in the UK, Ireland and Australia, with the demand for more to be activated. As of December 2019 \- two years on from the first ever prison parkrun at HMP Haverigg in Cumbria \- over 4,000 parkrunners had clocked up over 23,000 walks, jogs and runs within prison walls""* \(E8\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 
 Biological objects imaged using Airy beamlight sheet fluorescence microscopy. 

Our research on the physics of optical beams has led to the commercialisation of a new form of microscopy known as Airy beam light sheet fluorescence microscopy \(LSFM\). It is a powerful new 3D optical imaging technique that finds principal application in cell biology and neuroscience. The key innovation is the use of a special light beam profile, the Airy beam profile, which results in several advantages over existing microscopes: a 20 fold increase in the field of view whilst achieving deep sample penetration and high resolution, up to 20 times reduction in imaging time, and  lower phototoxicity thus causing less damage to cells. 

 The University’s Airy beam LSFM technology was exclusively licensed to M Squared Lasers Ltd. They spun out a legally and financially separate biophotonics business unit, M Squared Life Ltd, in 2016 specifically to develop and sell a new scientific instrument, the “Aurora” light sheet microscope, based on the Airy beam. The economic impact has arisen through the creation of \[text removed for publication\] jobs \[text removed for publication\], the sale of Aurora systems, which has raised over \[text removed for publication\] in revenue up to March 2020, and the securing of \[text removed for publication\] investment to grow both businesses. 

 End users of Aurora work on understanding diseases and processes in neuroscience and developmental biology in Universities, Research Institutes and National Laboratories and are located worldwide, including the UK, across Europe \(e.g. Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine\), South Africa, and the USA. Compared with competing technologies, Aurora enables end users to image a wider variety of biological samples with less photon damage and do so more rapidly and with unprecedented image quality over a larger volume. These benefits are enabling new imaging approaches not previously possible, particularly for live samples. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Optical Manipulation group, led by Kishan Dholakia, within the Centre for Biophotonics in the School of Physics & Astronomy at the University of St Andrews, has an extensive track record in the development of using shaped light beams for imaging studies, including seminal work on the Airy beam shape, published in 2014 \[R1, R2\]. This beam is a curved light field with side lobes that retains its thin size as it propagates in space. It was applied for the first time to light sheet optical imaging by the group, which is the basis of the underpinning research. 

 Optical imaging for biological applications is undergoing a revolution not only to achieve high resolutions at the 10nm scale but also to meet the growing demand for the imaging of larger structures \(100µm to cm\). In contrast to standard microscopes in which light illuminates a sample and one collects an image through the same set of optics, light sheet fluorescence microscopy \(LSFM\) is emerging as a powerful alternative. LSFM irradiates a section of the subject with a thin ‘sheet’ of light and the fluorescence or scattered light is collected at right angles to the illumination. The method is very appealing when compared to illuminating and collecting light through the same optics as it allows rapid 3D imaging of live specimens, has very low toxicity due to dramatically reduced light exposure \(10 to 1,000 times lower than conventional imaging as only the part of the sample from which we wish to extract a signal is irradiated\), and offers high contrast due to the targeted illumination. LSFM is the tool of choice for neuroscience and developmental biology. It also has great potential for drug discovery, histopathology, and phenotypical studies as it allows rapid \(sub\-second\) imaging of 10s to 100s of samples. 

 The LSFM methodology has previously had three challenges that limited its applicability. However, we have now addressed these with our research on optical beams. The challenges were: \(i\) how to create a sheet\-like beam of light that is ideally as thin as possible, which extends right across the field of view of the sample to provide uniform image quality across the whole field of vision; \(ii\) how to address \(i\) whilst keeping the light illumination level as low as possible to avoid any sample damage from excessive light exposure; and \(iii\) how to achieve increased light penetration \(depth\) into biological samples which are scattering and thus allow imaging at more than just the surface. Until now, these three challenges have restricted biomedical understanding and the ability to achieve high sensitivity and specificity in early diagnosis. Our approach of using the Airy beam, a transverse light pattern in two dimensions that does not change as the beam moves across the sample, addresses all three of these drawbacks. As a result, the technology can improve imaging of many biological systems, including the whole mouse brain, histopathology samples from cancer \(colon, prostate, breast\), and model organisms \(zebra fish\). 

 Prof. Dholakia’s group showed that they could overcome the above restrictions in LSFM through the use of an Airy beam in 2014 \[R3\]. The beam’s transversal structure has the unique property that allows the retrieval of high\-resolution information \(via a straightforward mathematical deconvolution algorithm\) to create an image of the whole sample. In 2016, the team showed that the proposed microscope could be developed into a compact solution to imaging in neuroscience \[R4\] and that the approach is also compatible with more advanced fluorescence techniques in 2017 \[R5\]. In 2018, this was extended to tailor the Airy beam to overcome degradation of the beam due to sample scattering, allowing it to achieve deep penetration into a given sample \[R6\].

 The commercialisation of Airy beam light sheet fluorescence microscopy based on our research on the physics of optical beams has led to **economic impact through the creation and growth of a new business**, M Squared Life Ltd. The **sales of Aurora microscope systems to customers worldwide**, based on our licensed technology, **have created \[text removed for publication\] jobs \[text removed for publication\] and generated \[text removed for publication\] in revenue between 2016 and March 2020.** As a result, the M Squared group has **raised GBP32,500,000 in Tier 1 investment** in 2020 to support future growth. The new technology **benefits end users in cell biology and neuroscience by delivering improved imaging performance over that available from previous microscopes** \(20 times wider field of view and up to 20 times faster imaging, lower phototoxicity, and 10 times higher signal to noise ratio\). Aurora microscopes have enabled new forms of live cell imaging for biologists and clinicians. In turn, this is assisting end users in understanding diseases and neuronal processes. 

 <ins>Translating</ins> <ins>biophotonics</ins> <ins>research into commercial products</ins> 

 Prof. Dholakia’s Optical Manipulation group has a broad portfolio of patents in Biophotonics. In 2015 the University of St Andrews completed a major IP licensing deal with M Squared Lasers Ltd \[S1\], a Glasgow\-based SME with 93 employees and an annual revenue of GBP17,700,000 that has specialised in the development of advanced laser systems. Included in this deal was IP associated with light sheet imaging \(Patent WO2013150273A1, 2013\) and the application of such techniques within biology and medicine based on the research described in \[R1\] and \[R2\]. 

 The intellectual steps and know\-how needed for commercialisation of the Airy light sheet technology was undertaken solely by researchers from the School of Physics at St Andrews whilst many collaborators supported the application of the technology to biology \[R2\-R6\]. Colleagues in the Schools of Biology and Medicine, University of St Andrews, the Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford and the Medical University of Vienna provided biological samples and interpretation of biological images. Femtolasers GmbH loaned a laser for multiphoton research, and colleagues from Denmark Technical University supported us in its use. 

 In order to develop successfully the products based on this IP portfolio and to progress into new marketplaces in biomedicine, M Squared Lasers Ltd founded a new business subsidiary, M Squared Life Ltd in 2016 on the University of Surrey’s research park in Guildford. The CEO recruited to manage the new company was chosen for his substantial experience of the biomedical imaging market, having previously been the Head of UK Instrument business at Nikon Corporation’s Instrument Company, a leading supplier of microscopes for the biology and life sciences. 

 Prof. Dholakia and his team in the Centre for Biophotonics worked closely with M Squared Lasers and M Squared Life between 2015 and 2017 as the companies developed the light sheet technology for the market. Prof. Dholakia also assisted in developing the early adopter customer base for the microscope by hosting end user technical visits at St Andrews and providing specialist advice to end users on the specifics of optical system parameters and microscope use. Because of this close collaboration, M Squared Lasers and the University of St Andrews secured an ISCF/EPSRC funded Prosperity Partnership in 2017 to translate the light sheet research and grow the microscopy business, in which the company matched the GBP1,434,010  [EPSRC funding](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R004854/1) commitment \[S2\]. This enabled the company to grow and develop the product range. 

 In 2017 M Squared Life was recognised with a Business Innovation Award from the Institute of Physics for bringing a new physics\-based product to market which had a transformative effect on increased turnover, profitability and jobs. The Airy beam light sheet microscope enables “ *scientists to perform 3D volumetric imaging of live cells and fixed tissue so they can understand more about the biological processes of diseases such as cancer and dementia*” \[S3\]. 

 <ins>Aurora Airy beam microscopes</ins> <ins>contribut</ins><ins>e</ins> <ins>to the</ins> <ins>UK</ins> <ins>economy</ins> 

 M Squared Life developed the Airy beam LSFM technology into the ‘Aurora’ trademarked microscopy product range \[S4\]. The company worked closely with early adopter customers internationally to bring the technology rapidly to market and develop Aurora as a flexible, modular system. The Head of Biophotonics at M Squared Life explained: “ *The technology in this platform has allowed us to create a unique Light Sheet Microscope product in that it is able to image a wide range of biological material unlike our competitors more dedicated systems*” \[S5\]. 

 Since 2016, sales of high value systems have been made to customers worldwide including “ *two Max Planck Institutes, The Nils Bohr Institute, The University of Southern California and the UK National Physical Laboratory.*” \[S5\]. Aurora is now installed in the “ *UK, USA, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland & South Africa*” \[S5\]. The Head of Biophotonics at M Squared Life confirmed that “ *As of March 2020 we generated revenues including contracts in process \[text removed for publication\] worth of systems.*” and that they have created *“… \[text removed for publication\] new high value technical and commercial positions.*” \[text removed for publication\] \[S5\]. As of \[text removed for publication\], they are currently handling end user enquiries worth “ *in excess of \[text removed for publication\]*” \[S5\]. In context, the global light sheet microscopy market in 2019 was valued at USD105,410,000 in 2019 and is expected to reach USD181,900,000 by the end of 2026 growing at a compound annual growth rate \(CAGR\) of 10.27% during 2021\-2026. \[S5\]. 

 The commercial success of Aurora brings wider economic benefit to the M Squared group of companies as the Head of Biophotonics explains: *\[text removed for publication\]* \[S5\]. He added, “ *The momentum the Biophotonics business has contributed to the M Squared group…has helped the company secure \[text removed for publication\] funding to further the next phase of the company’s growth…*” \[S5\].

<ins>Improvements in live cell imaging for</ins> <ins>international</ins> <ins>end users in</ins> <ins>biomedicine</ins> 

 The innovative use of Airy beams in LSFM, which has been translated from our research, is **bringing tangible performance and efficiency benefits** over previous technology to **a diversity of biomedical end users in neuroscience, developmental biology, regenerative medicine and cancer research**. Understanding functional biology requires rapid 3D imaging of large volumes with sub\-cellular resolution. Airy beam LSFM offers significant performance improvements over existing biological microscopes: 20 times wider field of view and up to 20 times faster imaging, lower phototoxicity and 10 times higher signal to noise ratio \[S4\]. These benefits enable end users to perform rapid 3D volumetric imaging of live cells and fixed tissue so they can understand more about the biological processes of diseases such as cancer and dementia. The technology is now used in facilities for neuroscience and developmental biology in Universities, Research Institutes and National Laboratories worldwide. The benefits to end users and the industry are exemplified by the following testimonials. 

 A Senior Research Scientist at UK National Physical Laboratory, where a system was installed in 2017, verified the benefits: “ *We use the Aurora Airy beam light sheet microscope system for a wide range of volumetric fluorescence imaging experiments in our lab. In particular, we find the capability of the system to rapidly image large samples with sub μm spatial resolution make it well suited to studying 3D cell cultures and multicellular models, which is helping us to investigate structural changes in tumour organoids in response to therapeutic drug treatment*” \[S4, p. 5\]. This team has shown that Aurora “technology *is ideal for imaging \[text removed for publication\]*” \[S5\]. 

 The improvements over previous technology are clearly stated by the Manager of the Live Cell Imaging Facility at the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, which provides biological imaging facilities to around 70 medical science researchers: “ *Compared to the capacity we had before acquiring the Aurora light sheet, we have improved greatly the speed of imaging, the ability to image very large samples as well as the ability to image live samples in large gels without phototoxicity.*” Furthermore, she states that “ *Additionally, the Aurora light sheet benefits from a very large field of view over 780x780 µm with a resolution better than 1µm over the whole image which is an exceptional performance.*” \(2020\) \[S6\]. 

 The Head of the BioOptics Service Unit, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Germany, which provides light microscopy services to 150 researchers, states: “ *the Aurora instrument provides an extremely flexible specimen area with an incredible observation volume*” and has enabled them “ *to improve our temporal resolution compared to the classical approach by factor of 4 with an increased observation volume and improved resolution in Z\-direction.*” \(2020\) \[S7\]. 

 The Director of the Wohl Cellular Imaging Centre, King's College London, describes the improvement: “ *we are now able to image 3D neuronal organoids … in 3D, 20x faster than with our previous imaging system. This has allowed us to visualise the 'self\-organisation' of neural stem cells into neural rosette structures in 3D, which we were not able to do with traditional confocal and 2 photon imaging approaches. This system now provides the ability to rapidly acquire overall neuronal architecture uniformly within large volumes of neuronal tissue.*” \(2020\) \[S8\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 LSBU’s research with 5,329 young women in Lambeth provided insight into the factors that influence their participation and attitude to sport and physical activity. Professor Mileva’s team formulated recommendations for effective strategies to engage young women that have informed the practice of exercise providers, shaped public health education, and community sports policy and delivery nationally and internationally. The recommendations have informed Lambeth Council’s approach for future service commissioning and sport and leisure provision. The evidence has influenced Sports England’s 10\-year community sports vision, Uniting Movement, and was cited in The British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences’ evidence to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee’s enquiry into ‘Sport in our community’ in 2020. The research and delivery model were internationally translated and have shaped physical education and sports programmes in the United States and Malawi. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Only 22% of adolescents are sufficiently active, which drops below 10% in ethnic minorities and low\-income families. Data strongly associates sedentary lifestyle in childhood with increased obesity and premature mortality in adulthood, and higher and more sustained physical activity levels with better health. Yet, the question remains: how best to achieve lasting change in physical activity behaviours, particularly in early age. To tackle this issue the LSBU team has undertaken an integrated multidisciplinary research programme concerned with the increasing physical inactivity and mitigating the incidence of poor diet in children and adolescents. The team adopts a co\-production approach with all relevant stakeholders, in which mixed\-method theory\-driven research runs in parallel with programme design, delivery, outreach activities and efficacy evaluation. 

  

 The research improved understanding of the: 

 1.  **Effects of diet and physical activity on health.** Studies run since 2000 on the relationship between nutrient intake and energy expenditure in primary school children and adolescent females demonstrated that: \(i\) insufficient consumption of micronutrients leads to higher calorie intake particularly in already obese individuals; \(ii\) dietary restraints supress physical activity levels, which explains the low popularity of exercise as a means of weight loss at this age; \(iii\) education on how diet and physical activity impact health, built on an understanding of girls’ weight concerns, social pressure and socio\-economic background, is critical for influencing their eating and exercise behaviours **\[R1\]**. 

 2.  * **Determinants of exercise participation and retention.** Data were collected between 2005\-2011 from more than 500 patients referred by over 40 general practitioner practices and community mental health trusts to local exercise schemes or pulmonary rehabilitation services. The ways individuals perceived themselves in relation to exercise \(exercise identity\) and the support and benefit from attending were identified as the core determinants of adherence behaviours. A new model of exercise behaviour was proposed and tested for clinical significance through efficacy analyses of exercise referral and community development programmes for tackling obesity **\[R2\]**. 

 3. **Design of innovative programs tailored to individuals and communities**.* In a pan\-European partnership \(2005\-2008\) the team explored the potential of communal sport delivery to catalyse social transformation and increased participation from marginalised groups. The findings evidenced the need for: \(i\) modular training of community\-based adult activists, leaders and educators at Further and Higher education level to develop, deliver, support and assess such schemes; \(ii\) provision of web\-based delivery and support; \(iii\) recognition of this education within the European credit transfer and accumulation system **\[R3\]**. Follow\-up research \(2009\-2011\) highlighted the benefits of using innovative approaches to motivate people to incorporate physical activity into their daily lives. Linking the use of web\-based services and pedometers to monitor activity levels with incentives for charitable causes produced superior engagement in more vigorous physical activity and mental health \(lowered depression\) improvements **\[R4\]**. 

 4. **Requirements for sustainable exercise provision for young girls and women**.* Inspired by Sport England’s national campaign ‘ *This Girl Can’*, a consortium of local partners delivered a large\-scale community\-based intervention and research programme ‘ *This Girl Can Lambeth*’ \[TGCL; 2016\-2018\]. LSBU studied the benefits from participation in communal sport and physical activities, the barriers and facilitators to participation and evaluated the cost\-effectiveness of the service delivery. The project engaged 5,329 young women \(14\-25 years old, >50% BAME, 10% with disability\) recruited from local schools and colleges \(e.g. Notre Dame Roman Catholic girls’ school, Graveney school, Platanos college, LSBU\) and 5 wards of low participation and high deprivation in Lambeth \(e.g. Coldharbour, Tulse Hill, Brixton Hill, Ferndale, Vassal\). Data were collected through a registration database \(Views, Substance, UK\), health and fitness assessments, a RE\-AIM \( *Reach\-Efficacy\-Adoption\-Implementation\-Maintenance;*  [https://www.re\-aim.org/resources\-and\-tools/](https://www.re-aim.org/resources-and-tools/)\) survey, focus groups and interviews. The research identified that: \(i\) sport delivery settings for young women are limited mainly to educational institutions and intervention effectiveness is mostly evaluated through intrapersonal factors, e.g. health benefits **\[R5\]**; \(ii\) participants perceive family, culture, instructors’ competency and venue safety as their primary barriers to physical activity, whereas sport providers also identify organisational, environmental and legislative factors for sustainability of provision as key characteristics for program success; \(iii\) there is a need to align the often\-contrasting expectations of participants and providers and the funding strategies and deliverables of all stakeholders **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 LSBU research has improved public health education targeted at young women, and has informed community sport and physical activity service commissioning, delivery and evaluation locally \(Lambeth Borough\), nationally \(Sports England, House of Commons\) and internationally \(USA and Malawi\). The primary beneficiaries are the local young women that participated in the TGCL project, community sports leaders, local, national and international sports service providers, and policy decision makers. 

 **Improving physical health, mental well\-being and attitude to sport of young women** 

 In the period between 2016 and 2019, six local sport for development providers \(Fight4Change; St Matthew’s project; BigKid Foundation; Streatham Youth and community Trust; Sustrans and LSBU’s Academy of Sport\) engaged 5,329 young women in 2,538 different sport sessions, community\-based activities \(annual Lambeth Country Shows\), empowerment days, nutrition, leadership and body image workshops, accumulating 51,823 contact hours and 30,714 participant throughput \(visits\). 30% of participants were previously inactive and 53% of them were of UK BAME origin representing the Borough’s demographic profile, showing project effectiveness for reaching participants at risk of inactivity prior to participation. The participants benefited from improved physical fitness, mental health and attitudes to active lives all attained in a cost\-effective manner \(approximately GBP133 per participant; **\[S1\]**\). One participant said:  “ *I remember my first ever session I was like the little scared girl in the corner ‘cos I didn’t know anyone, and I wasn’t confident with anyone and it’s like now I go there and I’m a bit too comfortable with some people*”. 80% of participants stated that they were more likely to continue participation because the programme met their expectations and had made them enjoy sport and physical activity more than before: “ *More self\-improvement and becoming a better version of myself…seeing myself compared to how I was prior to boxing, erm, it kind of motivates me to keep going forward and see how far I can really go*” **\[S1\]**. 

 **Informing and shaping sport and physical activity provision in Lambeth** 

 Despite COVID\-19 pandemic drastically reducing communal sport delivery during 2020, our research has helped TGCL delivery partners improve their services via diversification of their offers to better engage with the targeted \(sub\)populations: “ *The annoying thing about lockdown is the stop and start because we know it takes time to lead in that recruitment and when you stop you have to go back. But the sessions we did do, the feedback is the girls loved it, but it was also a referral into the program from Active Community Network who run a boy’s programme, so it was a crossover of them asking the boys to tell their sisters, which was another bit of the research that came out*” **\[S2\]**. 

 The research showed that young women need role models to influence their attitudes to active and healthy lifestyle and respond better to a focus on both mental and physical health benefits: “… *\[this activity\] improves your mental state and not just your physical state”* **\[S1\]**. This evidence was quickly adopted by the sport providers and used to enrich their programme content by mixing sport sessions with empowerment and educational workshops: “ *We want to continue with the empowerment days …to also incorporate females …from the estates that they live that have maybe gone on and done something… they want to see role models that are in their area…they want to see people from their ethnicity from their background people athletes, businesspeople, lawyers, accountants. Makes it an achievable aim and goal and it becomes more realistic to them*” **\[S2\]**. 

 The research highlighted the particular importance of the instructor’s personality and skills for keeping young women engaged **\[R5\-R6\]**. A sport provider shared: “ *Since the research I’ve actually hired a female lead…an England international brilliant boxer…part of that empowerment role model stuff that we looked at. She’s got a lived in experience of mental health, homelessness and domestic abuse in her childhood so when we talk about hiring the right individuals and the right coach which I think came out in the research, it has to be that right person*” **\[S2\]**. The importance of coaches’ competence also influenced the training programs of LSBU’s Academy of Sport, which prepares and engages students for community sports coaching and volunteering. The Senior Sport Development Officer stated: “ *The evidence produced by the ‘This Girl Can\-Lambeth’ project was used for development of the LSBU Academy of Sport’s Sports Ambassador scheme and the new branch\-out targeted intervention ‘Yes she can\!’ to educate and empower young people as activists promoting physical activity to the target population.*” Since 2016 the scheme has educated and trained 300 ambassadors who have been commissioned by local organisations and charities to deliver sports activities to over 2,000 local children **\[S3\]**. 

 **Informing local governance and national policy for communal sports** 

 The research has influenced and informed the local council’s vision, providing them with data and insights on how their health and wellbeing strategy should be re\-shaped to engage young women in sport and physical activity: “ *…previously it used to just be increase female participation that was always the case now it might be a bit more defined in terms of age groups or ethnicity or focus on a disability or an impairment so it can be a little bit more refined because of the availability of data*” **\[S4\]**. The evidence informed the council’s approach for future service commissioning: “ *I think we will move away from the current contract which is very input based…it will be much more output\-based and target\-based*“; resource development: “ *the recommendation around the improved safety of locations … is something that I believe we can bring in to the Lambeth Made Safer for Young People strategy*”; and local sport provision in the Borough: “ *\[TGCL\] is an important study particularly as we start shaping what we’re going to do with our leisure provision in the future and the sport facilities and parks as well…it is an important study that we really need to utilise in shaping our services and where we go in the future*”. TGCL research provided supporting evidence to the council’s efforts to improve departmental coordination for more efficient resource allocation: “ *… council departments … work in silos and are probably inadvertently funding the same project twice over quite often so that’s a bit of work we’ve been trying to do internally*” **\[S4\]**. 

 TGCL research also informed Sport England’s current *Local Delivery Pilot* program and their new strategy for tacking inequalities going forward. The 10\-year vision ‘ *Uniting the Movement*’ builds on successful approaches identified by TGCL such as “ *the value of co\-design with communities, the importance of developing meaningful impact assessment \(quantitative and qualitative\), and developing leadership across a whole system*”. This is evident in the strategy’s whole systems’ approach for movement, sport and physical activity and focus on creating positive experiences for children and young people, connecting communities and realising the power of people and leadership. The Local Pilots and Priority Places Manager at Sport England said: “ *The learning from TGCL provides an aligned local perspective on this national challenge and is well aligned with local partners to reduce inequalities in physical activity participation.*” **\[S5\]**. 

 The TGCL evidence on the facilitators and barriers to female participation in physical activity across the whole system, from individual through to policy levels, was referenced in the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences’ recommendations submitted in December 2020 to the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on what actions the UK Government can take to guarantee the future survival of the community sports sector and people’s return to sports and physical activity in the wake of the COVID\-19 Pandemic **\[S6\]**. 

 **Influencing community youth sports schemes in the USA and Malawi** 

 TGCL research and recommendations were widely disseminated via national \(e.g., BASES 2017 conference; the UK Sport for Development Network conference 2019; **\[S7\]**\) and international conferences \(e.g., American Association of Adapted Sports Programs 2018, Canada; the European Federation of Sport Psychology; and the European Network of Young Specialists in Sport Psychology 2019\) to sport practitioners, charities, researchers and decision\-makers. This has attracted international interest in the TGCL programme and created opportunities for using the findings to inform projects and shape practice for engagement of young women in sustained physical activity in other countries. 

 In 2017 the research team won support from the UK Fulbright Commission and the US Department of State to host two visits to LSBU of Dr Leeja Carter, a feminist applied sport psychologist from Long Island University in New York, as a Fulbright Specialist, to explore the potential for translation of the unique scope and processes TGCL project in the USA **\[S8\]**. Dr Carter said: “ *…TGCL provides a diversity of physical activity and sporting opportunities to marginalised girls using a mechanism of their current school environment as well as partnering with outside sport programs…the whole introducing girls to something new but in a way that’s controlled and there’s this additional element of emotional and social empowerment …\[I\] felt that this is something that is needed in the US*”. Following a return visit from the LSBU team to New York in 2019 to assist programme translation, Dr. Carter initiated work to secure funding for replication of the TGCL program in New York and Chicago: “ *I see the long term benefits and how that could be very helpful for particularly women of colour in the US”. The COVID\-19 pandemic has postponed the launch of the programme in Brooklyn schools, but plans are in place to get it underway as soon as it is safe to do so”* **\[S9\]**. 

  

 Through LSBU’s sport ambassadors, TGCL research has shaped sports activities delivered to school children in Malawi. In 2019 student and staff ambassadors from LSBU delivered over 1,000 hours of voluntary sports coaching to over 4,000 participants from local primary schools \(Nakundu and Kalenjeka\) in Malawi. LSBU’s Senior Sports Development Officer said: “ *The Sports Ambassadors supported the Charity in the development of local community and school sports education programme as well as informed the local staff training to maintain the sports programmes, which was in line with TGCL project research outcomes*” **\[S3\]**.  The CEO of Naturally Africa Volunteers said: “ *The partnership with LSBU has given a real boost to our sports activities in the local primary schools that we assist. … developing a passion for, and skills in, a variety of sports that would otherwise not be possible*” **\[S10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The novel insight generated by Hemer’s osteological research into early medieval Wales and her commitment to communicating this knowledge has enabled the promotion of the study of scientific subjects in the Welsh\-language. She has generated research stories suited for dissemination via TV, public events, and through online learning media. By contributing to the S4C series Corff Cymru and its online spin\-offs, \(the first of its type for S4C\), Hemer’s research has been used to close the gap in Welsh\-language science programming identified by the Science Advisory Council. She has become the public face of this programming whilst also promoting and encouraging citizen involvement and interest in the archaeology of Wales.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The period of history following the end of Roman rule in Britain is often referred to as the ‘Dark Ages’. However, if we look to the archaeological record, it becomes apparent that such a term is a misnomer, for we are presented with a wealth of evidence reflecting the everyday lives of those early medieval communities including the clothes they wore, the food they ate, the settlements they inhabited, and how they dealt with life and death. Central to our understanding of this period has been the excavation of Anglo\-Saxon cemetery sites from England. However, the contemporaneous burial record from Wales, and the scientific analysis of those excavated cemetery populations have long seemed to offer much potential to archaeologists but have been overlooked by researchers. The presence of ordinary burials, and those of women and children, as well as men, adds to the record provided by more richly furnished burials like those found in England. Hemer recognised and embraced the potential for research into early medieval Welsh cemetery populations, including at St Patrick’s Chapel in Pembrokeshire \(R1\). This work provided a unique opportunity to both add to the archaeological record and engage public audiences with a previously neglected area of Welsh archaeology. Hemer’s osteological, biomolecular, and funerary archaeological research in Wales, conducted at the University of Sheffield and supported by a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellowship \(R2\), has not only shed light on the health status and dietary practices of those ‘Dark Age’ populations \(R3\), it has also provided evidence for a significant breakthrough in our understanding of long\-distance migration to Western Britain, in particular, Wales. Using the study of skeletal remains, Hemer has shown this practice was not, as previously thought, restricted only to Anglo\-Saxon England \(R4\), and that the movement of people may have been facilitated by the on\-going trade of luxury items imported through a network of interconnectivity between east and west. That people moved alongside the transportation of such material has been woefully overlooked until now. Hemer’s research also challenges an androcentric model of past population mobility by identifying the extent to which women and children migrated into Western Britain during the post\-Roman period \(R5\). Her research exploits novel isotope\-based approaches for gathering evidence of transhumance and successive phases of relocation and residence \(R6\). This helps to explain the key role of child migrants in medieval economies, religious practice, the construction of identity, and pan\-familial social structures \(R5\), but not at the expense of advocating for the importance of childhood narratives in the study of Welsh identity in the past. Hemer’s research has situated ‘the child’ in Wales within a growing discourse around early medieval childhood more broadly \(R5\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Science TV programming in Welsh 

 Hemer’s unique approach to the archaeology of Wales garnered the attention of Welsh language TV producers, Boom Cymru, who were looking for content for a new science\-themed series \(Corff Cymru\). This was the first series of its type for broadcast on the Welsh\-language channel S4C and a direct response to concern from the Science Advisory Council that although world\-class research was being conducted in Wales, there was little broadcast on the subject \(S1\). The lack of resources for science in Welsh and difficulty recruiting science teachers to Welsh\-medium schools has also been documented by Estyn, the government inspectorate for education and training in Wales, indicating that this programming could be used to raise awareness of the quality of research in and about Wales and address a significant resources gap \(S1\). Hemer’s speciality in bioarchaeology made her an obvious choice for the producers, who were seeking to address an identified opportunity in S4C’s cultural mission. These were: 

-  to deliver factual programming 

-  bring novel and relevant science based historical research to a broad demographic of the Welsh\-speaking audience, 

-  support independent Welsh TV productions 

-  contribute to internationally significant activities to increase and improve Welsh language use, and Wales’ position in the world \(S2\). 

 Through her insights into the study of the human skeleton and the analysis of historic populations from Wales \(R4, R5\) Hemer provided Boom Cymru with both the overarching story for the production, Corff Cymru, as well as detail for individual episodes. Research utilising historical and archaeological evidence on the biology of the human body enabled Boom Cymru to focus on themes such as how the body works, and the genetic ancestry of the modern Welsh population. As an authoritative, young, female, Welsh\-speaking scientist, she was also offered the role as presenter. This combination enabled the producers to enrich Welsh cultural identity while promoting engagement with science in the Welsh language, and responded to the concerns of the Science Advisory Council and the mission of S4C. 

 Series 1 \(2013\) and 3 \(2016\) focussed on Hemer’s research. Series 1 ‘The Organs’, featured her work on early medieval skeletal remains from Wales, osteological and migratory stable isotope analysis from Llandough in South Glamorgan and work on the Viking Age burials from Llanbedrgoch on Anglesey \(R4\). Series 3 ‘The Body Through the Lifecycle’ was built around her research into child skeletons to explore the development of the non\-adult skeleton and the degeneration of the adult skeleton. 

 Corff Cymru reached more than 210,000 Welsh\-speaking viewers across the UK \(151,000 in Wales, the remainder in the rest of the UK\) and rated consistently at 80% for viewer appreciation \(S3\). Viewing figures equate to approximately 25% of the Welsh speaking audience and are comparable to key Welsh cultural events such as the National Eisteddfod, \(S3\) eight days of competitions and performances, considered the largest music and poetry festival in Europe. Positive feedback provided by the public \(S4\), contributors and the Factual Commissioner \(S4C\) resulted in Boom Cymru submitting the series for a 2013 BAFTA Wales Breakthrough Award. Nominations are bestowed to emerging professionals who have contributed to well produced work of significant impact \(S5\). In addition, Corff Cymru was a significant financial success for Boom Cymru who reported an increase in revenue between 2013\-14 and recommissioned the show for two additional series and a one\-off special \(S2\). All three series continue to be made available for Welsh viewers, via scheduled broadcasts and the Clic Catchup service, reaching audiences of 58,000 for repeat programming and 15,000 for S4C’s service for Welsh language learners Dal Ati \(S2, S3\). 

 Community education and social care in Wales 

 As well as ending a lengthy absence of Welsh\-language science programming \(S1\), the series has been used to support Welsh\-language teaching on scientific terminology by Dal Ati. The bi\-lingual organisation Social Care Wales’ Dementia Hub also uses a production edit to teach carers how activities incorporating art can enrich the lives of people living with dementia \(S6\). This goes beyond the original vision for the series, and makes it available to a demographic of viewers who did not previously access this material \(S6\). 

 In addition to Corff Cymru, Rondo Media commissioned an episode of Cynefin on Hemer’s work with Dyfed Archaeological Trust on St Patrick’s Chapel in Pembrokeshire. This long\-standing relationship between researcher and Trust \(which includes her appointment as a Trustee\) has sought to fulfil their mission of advancing the education of the Welsh public in archaeology, and the commissioned programme is the latest collaboration which fulfils this aim \(R1\). Past projects have included exhibitions \(e.g. about St Patrick’s Chapel in St David’s Cathedral, 2015\) and public outreach \(e.g. guided tours\) around live archaeological excavations \(R1\). Bilingual outreach, led and facilitated by Hemer, as part of the St Patrick’s Chapel project owed its success to being embedded within the local community \(many St David’s residents joined the excavation as volunteers\) and “stimulating ‘grassroots’ community interest in local history” \(S7\). The producer of Cynefin said that Hemer’s expertise in the excavation of St Patrick's Chapel was “ *invaluable to me as the program producer in researching and preparing the item*”, and that her “ *willingness to contribute on camera to talk about her work as an archaeologist and the research she has undertaken excavating in the chapel greatly enriches the item*” \(S8\). 

 The research environment for archaeology in Wales 

 Hemer’s research reputation and expertise on Welsh archaeology in particular led to her co\-authoring the 2017 Research Framework for the Archaeology of Early Medieval Wales \(S9\). This publication sets the national agenda for future archaeological research in Wales, in both academic and commercial contexts. Through the Research Framework, Hemer’s knowledge of the early medieval funerary landscape of Wales and her expertise in the scientific study of Welsh skeletal populations \(R3\-R5\) has informed the direction of research undertaken on cemetery sites/populations in Wales, identified aspects of the funerary record which require further research, and argued for the need to incorporate the excavation of Welsh sites and associated post\-excavation analyses into larger, funded research projects. As such, it is considered to be the go\-to document for those engaged in archaeology in Wales \(including academics, commercial companies and the public alike\), and is published on the Research Framework for the Archaeology of Wales website. Since publication, the Framework has been cited c.170 times in books, academic journals, and commercial reports \(S10\).

 **1.Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\)** 

 Bizet’s *Carmen* is one of the world’s most performed operas, but no published edition has reproduced the score of the Parisian premiere \(1875\). Rowden’s work on a new edition considered manuscript performance scores, libretti and staging manuals from the original Parisian productions to produce an authoritative score with unique information on staging, to be used by practitioners to inform new interpretations of the opera. This edition influenced operatic professionals \(directors, coaches, performers, composers\) to revise their performance approaches and transform their interpretations of *Carmen*. In addition, examination of performance in historical and transnational perspectives led to the creation of an interactive website tracing the opera’s cultural and performance history which provides audiences with new understandings of *Carmen*. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Rowden, a specialist in opera and nineteenth\-century France, researches how Bizet’s *Carmen* has developed from its very first performance to the modern day. Rowden’s ongoing research into the musical theatrical world of Paris during the second half of the nineteenth century makes her a leading authority in the field. Her extensive work on Parisian archival sources led to a monograph on opera and parody **\[3.1\]**, new insights on Gounod’s *Faust* **\[3.1\]** and the operatic careers of international singers **\[3.2\]**. 

 **2.1 Unique edition of **Carmen** 

 Rowden’s 2013 edition of *Carmen* **\[3.3\]**, co\-edited with Richard Langham Smith, is a ‘performance Urtext’: it is based on the opera’s first performances and uniquely recaptures both staged spectacle and musical text, including information not preserved in the scores or libretti from Bizet’s time. Published by Edition Peters \(and informally known as ‘the Peters edition’\), it draws on five principal sources: three musical \(one published and two manuscript\) and two dealing with staging. Rowden’s substantial contribution included assembling these resources, comparing and contrasting the different types of information in available documents, making editorial choices about which information to present and correcting proofs accordingly. Her detailed work on the unpublished score of the first performances in Paris \(which underpins the very concept of a ‘performance Urtext’\) is significant as this is the only manuscript source which is not available digitally. 

 The resulting edition is distinct from others in that it **\[3.3\]**: 

-  presents ‘opera as performance’ – it captures not only how the opera was first played but also how it was first staged; 

-  provides musicians with a working score – other scholarly Urtext editions, by including large amounts of material that is never performed, are too unwieldly for practitioners to use in preparing and rehearsing a production; 

-  provides extracts from the original staging manuals, all original dialogues, and prioritises the original French sung text. 

 **2.2 Tracing **Carmen**’s journey** 

 An opera continually evolves as it travels across borders, is translated and adapted. Rowden’s conception of the Peters score as a living document gave rise to *Carmen Abroad*, a transnational study exploring the establishment of *Carmen* in the operatic repertoire and its movement across the globe from its Parisian premiere in 1875 until the Second World War. She convened 20 international researchers \(a third of whom were Early Career Researchers\) at Cardiff University in June 2017 for the conference Carmen Singer of the World, in association with BBC Cardiff Singer of the World, in order to create a community for rigorous investigation and knowledge exchange between academics. 

 This network meeting became the foundation of an edited book **\[3.4\]** identifying the ways in which *Carmen* has been performed, produced, disseminated and interpreted worldwide. Traditional Eurocentric paradigms within opera studies have held that opera in Europe is a quality art form with highly trained performers, whereas operatic performances elsewhere can be seen as second class and derivative. *Carmen Abroad* – by studying performances of one opera over a seventy\-year period – challenges this assumption and, in doing so, remodels operatic history as a global cultural phenomenon. As well as co\-editing the 21\-chapter volume, Rowden contributed a full chapter on the overlooked history of French performance of *Carmen* in the provinces between its premiere and its first Parisian revival in 1883, and a co\-written introduction which draws chapters together and explores transnationalism in opera and opera studies today **\[3.4\]**. 

 Building on momentum from the conference, Rowden conceived of the accompanying website  –  [www.CarmenAbroad.org](http://www.carmenabroad.org/) **\[3.5\]**. Forming part of the emerging discipline of musical mapping in the digital humanities, it presents information and archival sources about performances of *Carmen* worldwide up to 1945. Rowden received a  British Academy/Leverhulme grant **\[G3.1\]** to fully develop the website’s potential to visualise geographical and historical data diachronically and in engaging ways. It is designed for a broad audience – including academics, practitioners, students and operagoers – and provides an interactive map and timeline of nearly 1000 *Carmen* productions, including images, archival documents and video resources for practitioners **\[3.5\]**. The website draws on diverse source materials and a huge variety of data, necessitating careful editorial and curatorial control by Rowden.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 How do you take one of the world’s best\-loved, most\-performed operas and still allow for fresh interpretations? *Carmen* has had a long history of modification and adaptation: Bizet wrote *Carmen* as an *opéra\-comique*, which included both spoken and sung text and, after his death, it was adapted into a fully\-sung version. By generating new ways of thinking about the opera, Rowden’s research: influenced creative practice; helped operatic professionals to create distinctive performances in a competitive market; transformed understandings; and created a new knowledge exchange community. 

 The vocal score co\-authored by Rowden **\[3.3\]** sold over 1,260 copies worldwide and was used for at least 67 performances in six countries \(Wales, England, France, Germany, Czech Republic, Singapore\). Companies who have used it include **\[5.1\]**: 

-  Mid Wales Opera \(2014\); 

-  Singapore Symphony Orchestra \(2016 – praised by *The Straits Times* for drawing *“a lot of inner detail from the \[Peters\] score which was refreshingly revealing”* **\[5.2\]**\); 

-  Dartington International Summer School \(2016\); 

-  Brno National Theatre \(2016\); 

-  Opéra de Dijon \(2019\); 

-  Cologne Opera \(2019/20\); 

-  It was also to be used for a new production at Paris’s Opéra\-Comique \(the site of the opera’s 1875 premiere\) with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, however the scheduled run from September 2020 was postponed due to COVID\-19. 

 The Peters edition offers detailed musicological and theatrical knowledge which allows freedom to create new yet informed spectacles for audiences. Examples of how it influenced directors, coaches, performers, and composers to revise their performance approaches are detailed below. 

 **4.1 Directing **Carmen** 

 Annabel Arden has a distinguished career as a theatre and opera director, encompassing UK productions for English National Opera, the Royal Opera House, the Glyndebourne Festival, the Royal National Theatre, and the BBC. Her wide\-ranging international directorial credits include productions in Lisbon, Barcelona, Salzburg, Chicago, and New York. She used the Peters edition for the innovative and inaugural production of *Carmen* at the Grange Festival \(June 2017\), and twice workshopped scenes with Rowden \(Royal College of Music, February 2017; Cardiff University, June 2017\) when preparing new dialogue \(by acclaimed playwright and librettist Meredith Oakes\) **\[5.3\]**. 

 Arden’s production re\-imagined *opéra\-comique* traditions for modern audiences. In her radical reinterpretation of the opera for an English\-language audience, she played with multiple languages and completely reimagined the dramatic storytelling by recreating the text spoken by the characters to allow for two narrator figures/actors to take their place on stage and interact with both the characters and the audience. She called upon Rowden’s leading expertise to employ conventions of period French revue and parodical theatre, adding the figures of the ‘compère’ and ‘commère’ to frame the spectacle, who step in and out of multiple characters, break the fourth wall to address the audience directly, and comment on what is happening on stage **\[5.3\]**. 

 Arden confirmed the Peters edition’s influence on her creative process and directorial decisions: “ *It helped me to understand the tone of what the opéra\-comique might have been like...This edition, with the research behind it, the images, and all the dialogue, led me to do what I did…I found the score enormously helpful. You do feel you’re linked to a history of performance practice in this score. You feel informed but not tied…\[this score\] was made by people who understood it would be changed, and you \[Rowden\] were really interested in change, so in that sense it’s a performance document”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 **4.2 Performing **Carmen** 

 The Peters edition’s inclusion of detailed stage and performance directions and full spoken dialogue is changing how characters are interpreted on stage. Pierre\-Maurice Barlier \- a nationally recognised expert vocal coach working with Welsh National Opera, Opera North and the Grange Festival, and Rowden’s husband – confirms the difference using the edition makes in musical and stage preparation. 

 Editorial elements specific to the edition have transformed how he and directors rehearse with actors. For example, the availability of spoken dialogue in the vocal score significantly informed Barlier’s creation of new French spoken text \(Welsh National Opera, 2019/20\): “ *I could easily draw on phrases from the original dialogue to give a traditional French or Parisian flavour, a “je ne sais quoi”, to the more modern and realistic text I was working with”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 The inclusion of the dialogues provides detail missing from the condensed recitatives composed by Guiraud after Bizet’s death. The ability to refer to dialogue in rehearsal transformed Barlier’s processes of reconstructing character motivation. He used the Peters score when coaching mezzo\-soprano Mirouslava Yordanova for the DomStufen\-Festspiele production in 2018 and found that “ *being able to refer to the Peters score was very helpful to take decisions. Especially in an older production where dialogue has been cut to a very thin skeleton, you end up with a superficial view of the character when actually the dialogues, all the threads, are there \[in the Peters score\] to give more depth to your character”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 Yordanova confirmed it was *“crucial in the composition of my role to be able to use the dialogue in the Peters score to be able to fill in plot details, character motivation and traits, and to find the right tone for each musical statement”* **\[5.5\]**. For Carmen’s final duet, she added that “ *the Peters score gives staging detail lacking in other editions but which provides clear details of characterisation from the original production which I was able to integrate into my work on the role”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 Industry professionals working with opera companies around Europe responded to a survey **\[5.6\]** regarding the score. Feedback on how they benefited from the score’s format and musical detail includes **\[5.6\]**: 

-  *“It’s always helpful to have the entire libretto and dialogue in one score, rather than having to refer to several copies. It helps to have a deeper understanding of the story and to see the development of the characters and plot, especially in the dialogue”;* 

-  *“They \[the critical indications\] are very informative and they give more knowledge to explore different ways of approaching the music and text”;* 

-  *“The detail provided in the score and musicality matched perfectly when learning it and provided ease when rehearsing the number. In addition, the spacing of the score aided phrasing and breathing structure”*. 

 **4.3 Orchestrating **Carmen** 

 Stephen McNeff is an award\-winning opera and musical theatre composer who has been commissioned by the Royal Opera House, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Welsh National Opera, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Chamber Choir Ireland, and Canada’s Banff Centre. He turned to the Peters Edition when commissioned to reorchestrate *Carmen* for Mid Wales Opera \(2014\), saying “ *I don’t think there was ever any question of not using the Peters edition because it is the authoritative edition…The Peters edition offers musicological details whilst allowing me the autonomy to create a new, yet informed ensemble; it can provide music and theatre professionals with a firm foundation on which to base their own work”* **\[5.7\]**. 

 The Peters edition helped him achieve his objective of reinventing the score for diverse audiences in small venues. The performance detail in the score \(both musical and staged\), and its conception as a living score that will necessarily be changed in performance, provided him with a working edition which stimulated and challenged his aesthetic choices; he noted that *“using the Peters edition as a primary tool generated compositional ideas which underpinned the success of the final orchestration”* **\[5.7\]**. His reorchestration of the score for ten instruments was described by arts critics as *“an inspired reduction”* \( *Wales Online*\), *“an extremely skilful reduction”* \( *The Arts Desk*\), and *“opening the door to a rich and intriguing Carmen”* \( *Wales Arts Review*\) **\[5.2\]**. 

 **4.4 Understanding **Carmen** 

 Rowden communicated her research findings publicly through specialist magazines, programme books and public events. For example, she organised an event on *Carmen* for operagoers with the Friends of Welsh National Opera in September 2019. When the audience was asked what most transformed their understanding of *Carmen,* responses included:, “ *Thinking about why we still perform it/see it today – the issues are not new but can be adapted to suit modern issues that modern audiences feel is relatable”* and “ *Understanding different ways in which the character of Carmen can be portrayed – much more nuanced than might appear on the surface”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 In bringing together a network meeting of scholars for Carmen Singer of the World in 2017, Rowden created a knowledge exchange community which had “ *a significant impact on the wider musical community in this country and throughout the world”* and *“helped to stimulate new ways of thinking and collaborating”* **\[5.8\]**. The incoming President of the Royal Musical Association identified the Carmen Abroad project as a model for other projects and stated that it “ *directly informed”* her approach to organising a conference \(with Rowden\) celebrating the centenary of the composer Saint\-Saëns **\[5.8\]**. She highlighted the project’s engagement with Early Career Researchers \(quoting an ECR who described the project as “ *a model for creating a research community and engaging ‘mobile’ postdoc researchers in a transnational community”\)* and noted that its model is “ *informing the establishment of a Network of European Musicological Societies, which is focusing on how to support younger postdoctoral scholars”* **\[5.8\]**. 

 The community collaboration which grew from Carmen Singer of the World is evident in the accompanying Carmen Abroad website. Edited and curated by Rowden, it offers a new way for audiences to engage with the opera’s history. Through its map and timeline, users can navigate performances while accessing performance data in textual, visual and aural formats. It extended the project’s reach \(original collaborators were from the UK, continental Europe, Ireland, Japan, the US and Australia\) as academics and specialists from around the world – including China, Singapore, and North Africa **\[5.8\]** – have made their research data readily available to a wide public through the site. 

 The Peters score has an increasing presence in higher education. McNeff uses the score as an *“example of good practice as it is unique in its consideration of both staged spectacle and musical text”* **\[5.7\]** when speaking to composers and librettists about incorporating stage directions into their scores. This was as part of his teaching role on the Operamakers MA programme at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, in residences at institutions including the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the University of Ljubljana \(Slovenia\), and in guest lectures at the Royal Northern College of Music, Trinity Laban, and Cambridge **\[5.7\]**. 

 Overall, Rowden’s research generated new ways of thinking about one of the world’s most\-performed operas. It underpinned new performances around the world, transformed the approaches of creative professionals, and stimulated new, critical responses from audiences.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Multidisciplinary research from the University of Bristol formulated a new fluid mechanical model that increases the accuracy of predictions of volcanic ash dispersal. The new mathematical model was embodied in a free\-to\-use, on\-line tool, PlumeRise, with over 500 registered users, including 170 practitioners with responsibility for advising on airspace restrictions and closures during eruptions. The model and tool are used by UK and international regulatory bodies, including the Icelandic Meteorological Office and Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre \(Australia\), for real\-time aviation decision making on airspace closures and during planning for eruptive scenarios. Predictions from the model and on\-line tool also inform civil risk planning globally. The Bristol team has additionally trained practitioners, helped build capacity within international agencies and have engaged with the general public to improve understanding of volcanic plume dynamics and the hazard to aviation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Volcanic plumes rise through the atmosphere because they are buoyant due to the rapid transfer of heat between the erupted ash and the gases in which it is suspended.  As the plume rises, it mixes with the denser atmospheric air, increasing its bulk density until it is no longer buoyant and begins to intrude horizontally through the atmosphere.  The height to which the plume rises is determined by the strength of the source \(i.e. the rate at which ash erupts from the volcanic vent into the atmosphere\) and the atmospheric conditions, such as the atmospheric stratification and the wind field. 

 During the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull \(Iceland\) and earlier eruptive events, the strength of the source was deduced from empirical relationships between observations of the height of the rise and estimations of the eruption rate for historical eruptions.  These relationships, the ‘Sparks’ or ‘Mastin’ curves, are dominated by the larger eruptions in the dataset, for which wind played little or no role.  The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull challenged the international community to develop better forecasting tools. As part of the UK NERC funded VANAHEIM \(Volcanic and Atmospheric Near\-to far\-field Analysis of plumes Helping Interpretation and Modelling\) consortium, and with specific funding from NERC \[A\], Hogg and Woodhouse \(School of Mathematics\), together with Phillips and Sparks, \(School of Earth Sciences\), formulated a new quantitative mathematical model of the fluid dynamics of this motion. This model was based upon a representation of the fundamental fluid\- and thermo\-dynamics, expressed through conservation, or balance, laws and encapsulated in coupled differential equations. Crucially, they included the effects of the atmospheric wind field on the mixing processes to show that the height of rise is reduced by the wind if all other atmospheric processes remain constant. This is due to the increased rate of mixing between the plume and its surroundings \[1\]. This predictive mathematical model allows the height of rise to be calculated as a function of the source strength and other measurable atmospheric properties; alternatively, the model can be run in reverse to determine the source strength as a function of the observed height of rise and the atmospheric parameters. 

 Woodhouse et al. \[1\] showed that for the eruptions at Eyjafjallajökull, the temporal variations in the observed height to which its plume rose could be fully rationalised by the recorded variations in the wind speed.  Furthermore, estimates of the eruption rate based on empirical relationships that do not feature any dependence upon the wind speed, could be underestimated by up to two orders of magnitude and thus ash concentrations may be similarly underestimated. 

 Subsequent research by the Bristol research team has applied history\-matching methods to deduce statistical estimates of plume properties from observations \[2\]; investigated calibration and sensitivity of the mathematical model \[3\]; contributed to the international inter\-model calibration exercise \[4\]; formulated a novel, well\-posed model for the time\-dependent motion that may result from temporal variations in the source strength or other processes \(and demonstrated that previous models are ill\-posed\) \[5\]; and has contributed to the development of practical systems that allow for multiple observations to be combined within a suite of models \[6\]. 

 The Bristol mathematical research into modelling volcanic plumes and the online tool, PlumeRise, were highlighted in *The Business of the Environment* \(NERC Strategy 2013\-18\) and contributed to the award of Queen’s Anniversary Prize \(2015\) to the University of Bristol volcanology research group.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Airborne volcanic ash is a long\-range hazard to lives and livelihoods and prediction of its atmospheric dispersion is vital for the accurate assessment of the risk that it poses. The Bristol model \[1\], enabling estimation of the mass eruption rate, and quantifying the strength of the volcanic source has been implemented in PlumeRise a free to use, web\-based tool \( [www.plumerise.bris.ac.uk](http://www.plumerise.bris.ac.uk/)\).  PlumeRise has over 500 registered users and more than 95,000 separate calculations have been made for various eruptive scenarios from around the globe \[a\]. Users include over 170 practitioners and researchers in international and non\-governmental agencies, including representatives from eight of the nine Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres \(VAACs\) and extensive usage by national agencies in Chile, Italy and Montserrat \[a\]. 

#  Increased safety and reduced disruption for aviation 

 Airborne ash poses a significant risk to the safety of aircraft flights, because of the possibility of severe engine damage.  Nine global VAACs, created in 1997 by International Civil Aviation Organisation \(an agency of the United Nations\), advise airlines and regulatory authorities with the potential outcome that airspace is closed.  Notably within UK and northern continental Europe, the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull \(Iceland\) led to the closure of airspace, the cancellation of more than 100,000 flights and an estimated economic loss across all sectors of USD5bn \[b, c, d\]. 

#  i\) Real\-time support to the Icelandic Meteorological Office 

 The most recent significant volcanic event in Iceland was the relatively long\-lived Holuhran\-Bardarbunga  eruption \(2014\-15\). The Icelandic Meteorological Office \(IMO\) held responsibility for monitoring and forecasting activities, both for Iceland, but also internationally.  \(During volcanic crises, the IMO, through a memorandum of understanding, feeds information to British Geological Survey \(BGS\) and UK Meteorological Office \(UKMO\), and the latter advises the London VAAC \[b, c, e\].\)  In their scenario planning, researchers at IMO operationally used PlumeRise to compute source conditions for their dispersion models.  The lead scientist at IMO, comments *“At the time of the recent Holuhraun eruption \(2014\-15\), the PlumeRise model was the only accessible plume model that could run with the real atmosphere”* and that *“we used PlumeRise to initialise dispersion models in our operational preparations and assessment of the potential hazards”* \[e\].  Furthermore, during the long\-lived eruption, the Bristol team produced twice daily predictions of the potential heights of rise of the volcanic plume for a range of eruptions rates using the latest meteorological data; these plots informed the committee for Icelandic Civil Protection \[e\].  For future usage during volcanic crises, IMO consider PlumeRise to be one of the key tools that they will employ operationally \[e\]. Furthermore, the Group Leader at IMO concludes that *“it is inevitable that future eruptions in Iceland will occur and that some of these will have impacts in Iceland and beyond. The research conducted by the University of Bristol has contributed significantly to the IMO’s institutional capacity to respond to volcanic eruptions.”* \[e\]. 

#  ii\) Long\-term risk planning in the UK and internationally 

 The Bristol team have engaged frequently with the dispersion and air quality group of the UKMO, who work with the London VAAC.  The Strategic Head of the group testifies that research outputs \[1\-6\] have set the agenda for their institutional approach to plume modelling and the determination of the source term \[c\]. Furthermore, the freely available PlumeRise tool with its easy\-to\-use interface is “ *hugely valuable to VAACs*” \[c\]. The operational usage of PlumeRise and \[1\] were explored in the UKMO report “Overview of volcanic ash mass eruptions rate estimation methods” \[c\], which determined that the model provides critical inputs to the determination of the concentration of airborne ash. PlumeRise has been used as part of UKMO training of VAAC forecasters to determine the effects of variations of source conditions on precited dispersion \[c\].  Additionally, the research has impacted the UKMO treatment of natural variability and uncertainty in the usage of relationships between the observed height of rise and the mass eruption rate and in future planning of volcanic scenarios through the EU\-funded project, FutureVolc \[B\], which ran a series of mock events to test operational response \[c\]. 

 The Darwin VAAC, staffed and trained by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, has global responsibilities for monitoring threats to aviation over Indonesia and southern Philippines, regions that feature some of the world’s most active volcanos.  PlumeRise is a tool that they employ operationally, in planning exercises and in post\-activity analysis \[f\].  For example, PlumeRise was used to determine the mass eruption rate of Rinjani, Indonesia \(2016\) to provide source conditions for ash dispersion predictions generated by the VAAC. Furthermore, the VAAC have developed a catalogue of eruption source parameters that are being used in ash dispersion modelling applications and PlumeRise was deployed to provide initial conditions for each volcano in the region \[f\]. This catalogue is now integrated in the operational tool that provides near real\-time information for the VAAC forecasters. Recent examples of its use include the activity at Agung and Krakatau, Indonesia and Ulawun, Papua New Guinea \(2019\-20\) \[f\]. The Bristol team have also provided the team at the Bureau with source code that implements the fluid dynamical model, which has been integrated with the numerical weather predictions.  The PlumeRise webtool has been added to the VAAC forecasters toolbox for use during volcanic crises and the modelling framework and model outputs have influenced the Bureau’s policies, procedures and own operational innovations \[f\].  The manager of the Darwin VAAC concludes that *“The PlumeRise model, web\-interface and under\-pinning research have contributed significantly to the work of VAAC Darwin and the Bureau of Meteorology, and therefore to the management of the ash hazard to aviation within our area of responsibility and more widely through our connections with the global VAAC network. The PlumeRise model supports our operational responsibilities, helping us to provide informative and science\-based advice to the aviation industry.”* \[f\]. 

#  Improved risk planning for civil society 

 Airborne ash has consequences beyond aviation, affecting population health and livelihoods. Following the Icelandic eruption, in 2012 ‘volcanic eruption’ was added to the UK National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies. BGS have used the PlumeRise on\-line tool to compute the effects of source variations and investigate uncertainty, thus *“providing robust information in our advisory capacity”* \[b\], including for the UK National Risk Register.  The head of volcanology asserts that the research \[1\-6\] and PlumeRise have *“led to significant changes in the way BGS assesses the hazard associated with volcanic ash and provides advice to government and non\-governmental stakeholders”.* Additionally, they are adopting a multi\-parameter system for monitoring and forecasting \(REFIR; \[6\]\) in which PlumeRise as a key component \[b\]. 

 In Mexico, over 26 million people live within 100km of Popocatépeti Volcano and are affected by ash fallout from its frequent eruptions during the past three decades.  Ash dispersion is modelled quantitatively by the Centro de Ciencias de la Atmósfera and the national civil protection agency of Mexico \(Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres\) to forecast the hazard to communities. The strength of the volcanic source specified by \[1\] is a vital input to these computations \[g\].  The lead scientist further comments that over 15,8000 forecasts have been computed and that daily alerts have been issued since May 2015 using this methodology in which the source term specification of \[1\] plays a crucial role \[g\]. 

 The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull provoked the international community to improve forecasting tools for volcanic plumes, and \[1\-6\] and PlumeRise was part of the response \[c\].  The Bristol team were key contributors to an international exercise to collate and compare best practice in plume modelling and its operational use \[4\]. This plume intercomparison exercise, promoted by International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of Earth’s Interior \(IAVCEI\) and involving operational institutions as well as academic researchers, led to a volume of benchmarking studies in which the Bristol team played a leading role \[h\]. The outcome of this study underpins hazard assessment worldwide, including in Colombia, Indonesia and Japan, as noted by its coordinator, the Director of Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia \(Bologna, Italy\) \[h\].  He further confirms that the Italian Ministry of Education and Research has initiated an assessment of the resilience to the hazards posed by volcanic ash, motivated and informed by the intercomparison exercise \[h\]. 

 The research \[1\-6\] has also impacted other international agencies, including United States Geological Survey.  Their scientific lead comments that \[1\] *“convinced me, and most of the modelling community that adding a cross\-wind was essential if we were to use models to relate plume height to the mass eruption rate”.*  Furthermore, he remarks that PlumeRise “ *has been a crucial advance*” and “ *should be standard for operational 1D modelling*” \[d\].  Within his role as chair of Volcanic Ash Scientific Advisory Group, a body created in 2010 by the World Meteorological Organisation and International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, he has advocated for the adoption of plume models by VAACs to initialise models of ash dispersion, highlighting PlumeRise *as “an exemplar of easy\-to\-use, robust and scientifically sound modelling tools”* \[d\]. 

#  Capacity building of practitioners 

 The Bristol team have delivered extensive training to international scientists with expertise on atmosphere dynamics \[c, i\]; underpinned the development and delivery of the undergraduate curriculum in volcanology at University of Lancaster; and built public understanding of volcanic plume dynamics.  Woodhouse has delivered lectures and run workshops at the 1<sup>st</sup>\-5<sup>th</sup> International Training Schools on Convective & Volcanic Clouds \(Italy, 2015\-19\) on the dynamics of volcanic plumes, drawing his material from \[1\-6\] and using PlumeRise to run through practical examples \[c, i\].  The organiser of the workshop confirms its reach, with participants drawn globally from 38 countries and several attendees now holding operational roles with national agencies \[i\]. He highlights Woodhouse’s vital contribution in “ *ensuring research methods are propagated rapidly and effectively to operational users*” \[i\] *.* 

 The Programme Director for  [Environmental and Earth Science degrees \(BSc and MSci\) ](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/undergraduate/courses/environmental-science/)at the Environment Centre, University of Lancaster confirms that PlumeRise is an integral part of their module on Physical Volcanology and some final year dissertations \[j\].  Students are lectured on the motion of buoyant plumes and explore the mathematically\-modelled dynamics using PlumeRise, which provides them with access to a state\-of\-the\-art fluid dynamical model, without the entry barrier of research level expertise in mathematics and numerical computation. The use of PlumeRise contributes 30% of the module assessment. For these reasons, PlumeRise is judged to be a crucial part of their curriculum \[j\]. 

#  Improving public engagement with mathematics 

 Finally, the Bristol team has presented its results to the general public through open days, national science fairs \( *Into the Blue*, NERC science showcase, Manchester 2016; *Big Bang* Exeter, 2017 and Bristol, 2017\) and the Bristol\-based *Pints of Science,* 2017.  These events had considerable reach and attracted over 15000 visitors, and at *Into the Blue*, the stand was voted as the best exhibit by the visiting public.  Well\-received sessions with Year 6 classes in Bristol schools have also been run to explain the hazard to aviation from airborne ash and its prediction through mathematical modelling, using interactive games and classroom challenges.  Feedback from the pupils included *“I learnt that you can use mathematics to predict volcanos”* and *“mathematics can calculate the height of ash clouds”,* which evidence success in communicating this research to a wider audience.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 From the 1990s to 2014 United Kingdom guidance to reduce sudden unexpected infant deaths \(SUDI\) advised parents to avoid bed\-sharing with their babies.

Durham University was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for this work in 2018. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Night\-time infant care and parent\-infant sleep behaviour in the United Kingdom has been a core research theme for Durham Anthropology Department’s Infancy & Sleep Centre \(formerly the Parent\-Infant Sleep Lab\). A 20\-year body of work \(1999\-2020\) encompassing qualitative and quantitative studies has been conducted in community, hospital, and lab settings, using sleep diaries, interviews, focus groups, video observations, actigraphy, and large\-scale surveys. Outputs relating to bed\-sharing, co\-sleeping and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome \(SIDS\) include over 50 journal articles and book chapters that are represented below by six frequently cited publications **\[R1\-R6\]**. Key findings from this research include: 

1.  Around half of United Kingdom babies \(350,000 per year\) have bed\-shared with one or both of their parents before they are 3 months of age **\[R2, R3\].** 

1.  Parents bed\-share with their babies for multiple rational reasons, but some do so accidentally and without foresight. These parents need information about when and where to avoid sleeping with their baby, and how to prepare in advance to do so safely **\[R1, R6\].** 

1.  Most babies who bed\-share \(73%\) are breastfed. Breastfeeding mothers bed\-share to cope with frequent night\-time feeds and to maximise sleep. They need information about practical bed\-sharing safety and what to avoid \[ **R2, R3, R4, R5**\]. 

1.  Breastfeeding mothers sleep with their babies in a characteristic way, documented in our home, hospital, and lab\-based videos. This provides safety benefits that parents should be made aware of. Other parents use this position less frequently and need specific guidance to ensure infant safety \[ **R4, R5**\]. 

1.  Parents reject or ignore SUDI reduction information that is dogmatic, inflexible, shames parents or adopts a fear\-based approach. Based on our research we proposed that safe sleep guidance in the United Kingdom would be more effective if moved from the ‘Authoritative’ to ‘Negotiated’ quadrant of Beattie’s \(1991\) Health Promotion model \[ **R5**\]. 

1.  A ‘one\-size\-fits\-all’ approach to infant sleep safety is unhelpful for parents and practitioners; recommendations should be sufficiently elastic to allow for the range of cultural and familial contexts within which infant care occurs \[ **R5, R6**\]. 

1.  How infant care messages are received and perceived by minority groups, and how culturally determined infant care practices are prioritised by immigrant mothers seeking to raise their infants according to the traditions of their culture of origin \[ **R5**\].

Our work showed this position to be restrictive and unsustainable, amplified the voices of parents who chose to co\-sleep, and demonstrated the close link between bed\-sharing \(a specific kind of co\-sleeping\) and breastfeeding. <ins>It has been used to change guidance in</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>U</ins><ins>nited</ins> <ins>K</ins><ins>ingdom</ins> <ins>and</ins> <ins>beyond</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>underpinn</ins><ins>ing</ins> <ins>new practice</ins> <ins>guidelines</ins><ins>, polic</ins><ins>ies</ins><ins>, and</ins> <ins>recommendations</ins> <ins>issued during the</ins> <ins>Research Excellence</ins> <ins>Framework</ins> <ins>\(</ins><ins>REF</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>assessment period.</ins> 

 In April 2012 we launched the Infant Sleep Information Source \(ISIS\) a knowledge exchange and research translation project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\), renamed in 2018 as the **Baby Sleep Information Source / Basis** \( [www.BasisOnline.org.uk](http://www.basisonline.org.uk/)\). In collaboration with three infant care NGOs \(Unicef UK, National Childbirth Trust \(NCT\) & La Leche League GB\) we aimed to provide easily accessible research evidence regarding infant sleep \(particularly research on co\-sleeping, SIDS, and the sleep behaviour of breastfeeding parents and babies\) for practitioners working towards the Department of Health’s target to increase breastfeeding rates in the United Kingdom, and for parents who breastfed their babies. As few researchers were studying the sleep of breastfeeding parents and babies, we drew heavily on our own research \[ **R1\-R6**\]. <ins>The Basis/ISIS website is now endorsed by all 7 U</ins><ins>nited</ins> <ins>K</ins><ins>ingdom</ins> <ins>breast\-feeding support organisations and is widely cited in recommendations and policy documents by</ins> <ins>National Health Service \(</ins><ins>NHS</ins><ins>\)</ins> <ins>trusts, Safeguarding boards, Local Councils and information sources across the U</ins><ins>nited</ins> <ins>K</ins><ins>ingdom</ins><ins>.</ins> We provide evidence of 70\+ United Kingdom sources signposting parents and practitioners to the Basis website **\[E1a\]** during the REF period, and unsolicited testimonials from practitioners and parents who have found the website and its research information helped them in better understanding infants’ sleep, again during this REF period **\[E1b\]**. The Basis website averages 12,000 users per month, with 60% from the United Kingdom, the rest being from 215 different countries **\[E1c, E1d\]** and was mentioned as a key element of our work in the citation for Durham University’s award of the Queen’s Anniversary Prize in 2018 **.** 

 In December 2014 the **National Institute of Health & Care Excellence \(NICE\)** 

 published a review of the international evidence around SUDI and co\-sleeping that examined the international case\-control study data and issued new United Kingdom guidance for health professionals **\[E2a\]**. The Durham Infancy & Sleep Centre director, who served as a topic specific expert on this panel, was invited to explain the relevance of our research \(including **R1\-R6**\) for the panel. This was reinforced by the comments of multiple stakeholder organisations who cited **R1\-R6** in their responses to the draft guidance **\[E2b\]**. The NICE update **\[E2a\]** recommended that parent\-infant co\-sleeping be recognised as a common night\-time caregiving strategy in the United Kingdom and encouraged health professionals to discuss the pros and cons with parents to facilitate informed choice. This was the guidance our research had determined was most appropriate for the United Kingdom \[ **R5, R6**\]. Subsequently NICE endorsed the Basis/ISIS information sheets \(part of the Basis website\) for parents on bed\-sharing as resources for practitioners implementing the new guidance **\[E2c\].** NICE guidance is issued for use by all health and care practitioners in England and Wales and it is expected to be implemented by all NHS Trusts, affecting 700,000 babies born in the United Kingdom every year. 

 This Durham research directly and extensively influenced **Unicef UK Baby\-Friendly Initiative \(BFI\)** guidance to health professionals on co\-sleeping. Unicef BFI produces various resources to support facilities in meeting Baby\-Friendly accreditation criteria. The Unicef UK BFI booklet *Caring for your Baby at Night – A guide for Health Professionals* \[ **E3a**\] \(updated 2016\) assists practitioners in delivering the ‘ *Caring for your Baby at Night*’ information to parents following birth. It provides the rationale behind the guidance provided to parents, with references to the evidence sources used. The Practitioner’s Guide highlights our research extensively, citing **R1, R2, R3,** & **R4, \(**plus an **additional 9 publications** from our work\). The Unicef UK BFI resource *Co\-sleeping and SIDS – A Guide for Health Professionals* \[ **E3b\]** \(updated 2018\) provides information to help practitioners discuss co\-sleeping and SIDS with parents \(following NICE guidance **\[E2a\]**\). It references **R2** and **R3**, plus **2 additional publications** by our team. Both above guides \[ **E3a and E3b**\] signpost to the Baby Sleep Info Source website **\[E1\],** and **\[E3b\]** carries the Basis logo. 92% of United Kingdom babies are born in hospitals that have achieved or are working towards Unicef UK BFI accreditation, therefore our research is used by the majority of the United Kingdom’s midwives and influences the care of 630,000 babies born annually in the United Kingdom. Because they are freely downloadable from the Unicef website, these two resources are also used widely around the world affording our research global exposure and impact. 

 In 2018 we \(as Basis\) were invited to co\-produce the most recent United Kingdom infant safer sleep guidance with Lullaby Trust, Unicef UK BFI, and Public Health England. New national infant sleep safety guidance Safer Sleep: saving babies lives* launched in 2019 supports implementation of NICE CG37 providing parents with an illustrated booklet \[ **E4a**\] and reminder card \[ **E4b**\] and practitioners with more detailed explanations about supportive conversations with parents \[ **E4c**\]. Information in this guidance on safe co\-sleeping \(including key images\) comes directly from our research in **R4**, **R5** and **R6**. All sources underpinning the guidance are in the Lullaby Trust evidence base document \[ **E4d**\] which cites **R3** and **R5**, along with **4 of our other publications**. These leaflets were issued to parents of 125,000 babies born in the United Kingdom in 2019 \(2020 figures not yet available\). Twins Trust also used our information to produce a Safer Sleep information leaflet for parents of twins available from their website \[ **E4e**\]. 

 We spoke about our research in Vancouver \(2015\) at the invitation of the British Columbia Lactation Consultants Association \[ **E5a**\] and 3 talks were live\-streamed to health facilities across the province. The British Columbia Office of Public Health found our research into the uptake of safer sleep messaging ‘particularly compelling’ and requested to use some of our resources in their safer sleep campaigns **\[E5b\]**. Working with the Co\-ordinator of Public Health and Health Promotion in the Perinatal Services Division we delivered a webinar to staff about our research to facilitate the development of ‘more nuanced messaging around bed\-sharing’ **\[E5d\]**. This culminated in the publication of **state\-wide safer sleep guidance and resources** for **British Columbia** in late 2017; the above co\-ordinator noted “…so far it has been very well received. People are so appreciative of the harm reduction approach to bed\-sharing and are find \(sic\) it very helpful in their practice.” **\[E5c\]** The British Columbia materials titled ‘ *Safer Infant Sleep – a practice support tool for health professionals’* \[ **E5f**\] and ‘ *Safer sleep for my Baby – Helping parents and caregivers create a safer sleep plan’* \[ **E5e**\] use a bed\-sharing quiz derived from our research, and information on safe positioning while bed\-sharing from **R4** to implement the risk minimisation / harm reduction approach to co\-sleeping that we recommend in **R1**, **R2**, **R5** and **R6**. British Columbia Perinatal Services Division serves 46,000 new parents per year who receive these new resources. 

 Several United Kingdom and international breastfeeding organisations use our research in the information they offer new parents about infant sleep. **La Leche League GB \(LLLGB\) and La Leche League International \(LLLI\)** use our research in their information sheets, website and published books for mothers. LLLGB’s *Safe Sleep and the Breastfed Baby* leaflet \(revised 2017\) cites **R3** and **R4** as well as 2 other recent publications by our team \[ **E6a**\]. LLLI also provides information sheets for parents on bed\-sharing safety \[ **E6b**\], and information summaries on its website citing our work \[ **E6c** citing **R5**\], \[ **E6d** citing **R4**\], \[ **E6e** citing **R1, R2, R3, R4, R6** and **5 of our additional publications**\], \[ **E6f** citing **R1, R2, R3, R4 and R6** and **2 of our additional publications**\]. *Sweet Sleep* published by LLLI also references our work extensively. La Leche League is the oldest breastfeeding organisation in the world \(61 years in over 70 countries\). LLLGB has 77 active groups supporting 25,876 mothers. LLLI covers 2000 local support groups operating in over 60 countries worldwide. 

 The reach of our work is illustrated by <ins>n</ins><ins>umerous</ins> <ins>international</ins> <ins>professional and parent support organisations</ins> <ins>who</ins> <ins>use</ins> <ins>our work in information for parents</ins>. The Australian Breastfeeding Association cites **R1, R2 and R4** in their 2014 parent\-leaflet *Bed\-sharing and your baby: the facts,* and acknowledge the Infant Sleep Info Source \[ **E7a**\]. The Australian College of Midwives’ *Position Statement on Bed\-sharing & Co\-sleeping* \[ **E7b**\] cites the **Basis/ISIS website**, **R3** and **3 of our additional publications**. The Red Nose \(Australian SIDS charity\) guidance *Sharing a sleep surface with a baby* \(2018\) \[ **E7c**\] cites **R2**, the **Basis/ISIS website**, and **6 further publications** from our research. The Hong Kong Department of Health \(Family Health Service\) refers to our work in their statement on *Co\-sleeping in Infancy: the controversies* \(2018\) \[ **E7d**\] citing **R1**, **R3**, **R6** and **4 of our other publications**. The International Childbirth Education Association uses **R2**, **R5**, **R6**, **4 other of our publications** and the **Basis/ISIS website** in their Position Paper *Safe Infant Sleep* \(2016\) **\[E7e\]**. The *Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine* Protocol on Bed\-sharing and Breastfeeding cites R1, R2, R3, R4, R6 and 15 of our additional publications \[ **E7f\].** 

  

 Our research is also cited in a variety of NHS trust policy documents on infant feeding, infant sleeping, and mother\-baby bed\-sharing. Some indicative examples that were in force during the assessment period include: Blackburn with Darwen NHS Trust *Infant Feeding Manual* \(2010\-2013\) \[ **E8a**\] cites **R1, R2, R3**. Wirral Community NHS Trust’s *Safe Sleeping Guidance* \(2017\) \[ **E8b**\] cites **R2** plus Unicef documents based on **R4**. Chelsea & Westminster NHS Trust & West Middlesex Hospital *Safer Sleep Guidance* \(2016\) \[ **E8c**\] extensively uses information from ISIS \(acknowledged\) and cites **R1, R2 and R3**. Salisbury NHS *Mothers & Infants Bed Sharing Policy* \[ **E8d**\] cites publications **R2, R3, R5, R6.** Basildon & Thurrock NHS policy \(2018\) on *Management of bed\-sharing for mothers and babies* \[ **E8e**\] cites **R3**. <ins>These documents guide practitioners employed by each Trust in the care of mothers and babies</ins> so affect variable patient numbers. NHS Scotland’s *Ready, Steady, Baby\!* \(2018\) guidance for new parents and *Parent Club* \(2018\) website both draw on publications **R1\-R4** and provide links to Basis for information on bed\-sharing. Both sources are free to all new parents in Scotland \[ **E8f & E8g**\]. 

 **Child Death Overview Panels \(CDOPs\) & Local Children’s Safeguarding Boards \(LCSBs\) \(England & Wales\)** review evidence from unexpected infant deaths in order to make recommendations about infant mortality prevention. These deaths may include SIDS, accidents, or infanticides. Some CDOPs & LSCBs issue sleep safety guidance when infant death reviews highlight a cause for concern. Our work is used in several of these guidance documents: e.g. Pan\-Lancashire *Safer Sleeping Guidance for Children* \(2018\) \[ **E9a**\] refers to the Basis/ISIS website, and signposts to our bed\-sharing decision tool; Suffolk’s Safe\-guarding Children’s Board’s *Suffolk Safer Sleep Strategy* \(2017\) \[ **E9b**\] cites **R6** and cites extensively from our research on the **Basis/ISIS website;** Merseyside CDOP’s *Multi\-Agency Safe Sleeping Guidance* \(2015\) \[ **E9c\-d**\] cites **R2** and several Unicef documents drafted in collaboration with our team. Although these CDOP and LSCB recommendations have limited reach in comparison with national guidance they serve an important purpose in highlighting local gaps in implementation. 

 In 2016 we expanded Basis to offer **practitioner training workshops and study days**, based on our research and other information from the Basis website. We have been invited to hold 30 Basis workshops to date, training over 1500 health practitioners, peer supporters and student midwives from Portsmouth to Aberdeen, Chelsea to Port Talbot, and been funded by the Scottish Government \(2019\-2021\) to provide webinar training to all relevant NHS staff in Scotland. <ins>This training</ins> <ins>upskills practitioners around SUDI</ins><ins>/SIDS, infant sleep safety and co</ins><ins>\-</ins><ins>sleeping, providing them with knowledge and confidence to discuss these issues with families and</ins> <ins>help them to understand and follow</ins> <ins>the new guidance in practice</ins>. A synopsis of evaluations from these events confirm the importance of the research evidence we produce and share with practitioners who support parents with breastfeeding and sleep safety **\[E10\]**. 

 The evidence confirms the international reach and the significant depth of impact from our research in underpinning policy, practice and recommendations regarding infant sleep safety.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Through the process of unpicking existing hierarchies surrounding art practice, research carried out between 2014 and 2020 by Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd at Bath Spa University has impacted positively on participants’ and audiences’ involvement and connection with art. At least 250 participants, including engineers, automotive workers, studio assistants and gallery assistants, who traditionally work behind the scenes have been placed at the centre of their research, impacting on their visibility and recognition, and breaking down the notion of the artist as a single author. One participant said that collaborating on a research project with Harrison was a “momentous” experience that “shone a light into my life”, leading to a realisation that “I could go and share my skills with people”. These researchers have brought a minimum of 200,000 people \(between 2014 and 2020\) into direct encounters with art objects and with the process of making art, resulting in new, expanded understandings of what constitutes art and creating new relationships between audiences and art practice *.* 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 How does the perception and practice of art change when the processes, materials and individuals involved in its making and maintenance are made visible? Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have examined these questions together, through a process of extending and interrogating each other’s research practices. Their interactions and connections have been strengthened by a network of relationships with curators and galleries as they work together through new understandings of creating and exhibiting objects. Their research is practice\-led and is focused in three areas: 

###  **Art as process** 

 Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd are concerned with art that invites viewers and participants into conversation with the moment of action. This contrasts with and challenges the traditional notion of an artwork as a finished item or a ‘full stop’. 

 Research by Kidd and Harrison has exposed hidden processes, bringing the act of making out of the studio or the factory and into public view. Kidd brings the process of covering the canvas with paint into the gallery setting \(R6\). Her automated paintings systems or machines \(2014\-2018\) use arterial systems of pipes and pumps to fill paintings from the inside or to drip paint over their surfaces, deferring the application of the paint and the completion of the works. Harrison’s *Heavy Rock* \(2014\-2015; R4\) made public the casting and installation of a 100\-tonne concrete wave breaker at the entrance to Plymouth Sound. Hydrophones cast inside the wave breaker animated the concrete block, relaying the sound of the waves back to the gallery setting. These works foreground the ongoing nature of the object and the process of making art, as well as challenging the boundaries between art and industrial processes. 

 Both Kidd and Dunseath have interrogated the studio as the site of making and have challenged the notion of ‘the exhibition’ as a display of finished artworks. *Curious about Care* presented the act of making the ‘paintings’ within the exhibition space \(R6\), while *Elbow* \(2015; R2\) involved transforming a gallery space into a studio environment through which artists came and went, leaving traces of their activities. Through their research, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd are working to break down the division between making and exhibiting. 

###  Learning with materials 

 Through an emphasis on art as process Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have created new relationships with their materials. Rather than seeking to impose forms or meanings onto materials, their research is centred on learning with materials and matter, as well as enabling audiences and participants to learn and engage with materials in new ways. 

 Harrison is concerned with the unpredictability of materials. Within his research he works with materials, skilled workers and participants/audience members, creating acts of enquiry and experimentation. In this way, he has explored the effect of sound on ceramics \( *Material Soundsystems,* 2014\-2020; R5\), the live firing of clay objects  and the behaviour of automotive clay models \( *Joyride*, 2016\-2017; R3\). The transformation of the materials is witnessed in public, by artist and participants/audience, creating shared moments in which new knowledge about materials and their potential are revealed. 

 Kidd’s painting machines also act as learning resources, as the audience and team tasked to care for them are drawn into the process of making, looking, and talking ‘with’. Dunseath’s research emphasises the ways in which materials play an active role in the creation of a work of art, demonstrating how a material can force a sculptor to bring together multiple studio assistants, with different skills, experiences and understandings \(R1\). 

###  Challenging the perception of the artist as single author. 

 An emphasis on process and materials is tied to a questioning of the perception of the artist as single author. What happens when the idea of a ‘single author’ is broken down and questioned? 

 Harrison’s collaboration with materials and skilled workers with specialist knowledge \(eg casting concrete blocks\) challenges the distinction between studio and industrial processes, and questions perceptions of material as ‘high’ or ‘low’. By basing participants’ roles on their own ‘normal’ work, Harrison’s research creates space for those people \(and challenges the audience\) to reappraise the value and status of their skills and abilities. Addressing the roles of studio assistants working for Sir Anthony Caro \(1924\-2013; an artist who played a pivotal role in the development of 20<sup>th</sup> century sculpture\), Dunseath’s *Artist Boss* \(2014\-2017\) also asks whether identifying Studio Assistants changes the reading of works of art \(R1\). Kidd’s research makes visible the importance of gallery staff to the exhibition of artworks and challenges hierarchies. 

 Questioning the perception of the artist as single author brings its own challenge for the researchers. Are they complicit with a system that prefers to focus on a single named artist? Is their work with undervalued and unseen individuals effective in breaking down hierarchies? What are the consequences of breaking down notions of authorship? The researchers are aware of the tensions involved in making use of other people in the creation of their work, and continue to debate these tensions and to develop research projects that address these complex issues. 

###  Outcomes 

 As a result of their research, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have developed new understandings of materials, processes and objects, and of the relationships people have with art objects, allowing them to create exhibitions and events in which participants and audiences engage directly with objects and processes. Their research into the making of objects has highlighted the range of individuals involved in the creation and presentation of art; making hierarchies within the discipline visible has resulted in them being challenged and changed.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd’s research has unpicked the hierarchies that surround the making and exhibition of art and has impacted on the awareness of the range and value of the work done by skilled individuals, including studio assistants and gallery assistants, within the discipline. Their research has also made a difference to the ways in which audiences relate to and engage with art, allowing them to be involved in the production of art objects, rather than having them mediated through explanatory texts or educational resources. The impact of the research by this group of artists is focused in two areas: increasing visibility and recognition for a range of individuals involved in making and caring for art; and bringing audiences into contact with the process of making art objects. 

###  Increasing visibility and recognition for a range of individuals involved in making and caring for art 

 Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have made a significant impact on understandings of who makes and maintains works of art, and how specific roles \(eg artist, studio assistant, gallery assistant\) are perceived in relation to one another. Greater understanding of these roles and of specialist skills and knowledge, on which artists and their works of art depend, has raised the profile of studio assistants, engineers, gallery assistants and skilled industry workers, as well as aiding the process of picking apart hierarchies within art practice. 

 *Artist Boss* \(2014\-17\) made visible the role of Sir Anthony Caro’s assistants in the making of sculptures, questioning traditional ideas of ownership and authorship. This piece of research \(interviews with 20 studio assistants; 3 exhibitions with over 1400 visitors; E5, E8\) brought to light the collaborations and activities behind the finished works of art. Artistic Director at the Royal Academy of Arts said the research “illustrates how ideas can take shape collaboratively whilst raising important questions on issues such as individuality and authenticity of the pieces” \(E5\). A testimonial from an Arts Advisor/Art Trustee acknowledges the rise in demand for skilled assistants and technicians in recent years, and states that by **“looking specifically at the role of the artist’s assistant \[Artist Boss\] opens up an important discussion about a particular aspect of art production that continues to be largely overlooked”** \(E5\). 

 Harrison’s research has made audiences and reviewers appreciative of participants’ \(including bus drivers, engineers and automotive industry workers\) deep experience and knowledge; an artist\-writer who attended Conductor highlighted the actions of the “ **skilled drivers**” who manoeuvred 32 buses to “perform slowly choreographed movements from the bus bays and across the forecourt” \(2019, Preston Bus Station and *The Harris Museum & Art Gallery*, Preston; 32 drivers, 8 volunteer performers, bus station manager, 8 event marshalls; audience of 200 at performance; 8000 views online; 15,000 visitors to the exhibition; E7, p1; E8\). 

 The act of taking part in Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd’s research has also impacted positively on individuals’ understandings of their own practice, skills and employment. The skilled individuals involved in *Heavy Rock* \(including 2 block casters, 20 Dockyard Diving Team, 24\-piece Royal Marine Band, 2 Babcock Marine engineers, Queen’s Harbour Master, Marine Sound Engineer, Sound engineer, Metal\-Wood fabricator; E3; E8\) and *Joyride* \(including 1 car model maker, 6 ramp builders, 20 volunteer event marshalls; E4; E8\) saw their skills and knowledge being celebrated and placed at the centre of the research. One former model maker at Longbridge Car Factory and co\-maker of the clay Rover 75 central to Joyride, said that taking part in the project had “made me look at the arts in a different way”, and had allowed him to think of car models, once carved from mahogany, as works of art \(E4\). Participating in *Joyride* opened up new possibilities and activities, including a serious \(and continued\) interest in making pottery, and presenting as a keynote speaker in an academic conference \(2017\). He described the keynote as “a tremendous experience” and said that, while sitting around the table with a group of professors, **“I felt as an equal…I was part of the discussion”** \(E4\). 

 A former studio assistant and artist who participated in Artist Boss, talked about the impact of the research on peoples’ perceptions of studio assistants, noting that the Artist Boss Roche Court exhibition had presented studio assistants as **“artists in our own right”** and had “ **re\-examined us, and presented us as equals**” \(E5\). The research had a direct impact on his own career, as the Roche Court exhibition had “spurred me into doing something quite experimental… a departure from how I was normally working”, leading to the creation of a sculpture that was subsequently selected for the Frieze Sculpture Park \(2017\): “ **which is probably the most high profile thing I’ve done and put me in the international art scene**” \(E5\). The *Artist Boss* publication \(2016; more than 400 copies sold\) has helped to increase visibility of studio assistants and has impacted on assistants’ own perceptions of the work that they do \(E5\). 

 Meanwhile, gallery assistants caring for Kidd’s painting machines noticed a shift in visitors’ attitudes towards them, as well as changing the nature of their role in the gallery \(E1\). An assistant at *Test Run* \(2014, Modern Art Oxford, 11,814 visitors; E8\) said that “seeing that the invigilator is actively involved in the process of the work” caused “a greater intrigue and social involvement from the viewers”, while their task of maintaining the paintings “shifted me away from the usual invigilator role” \(E1, p1\). This was echoed at Sullivan Galleries, Chicago, where a minimum of 40 gallery assistants who were involved in caring for the works “were often asked about the work” and found this to be a “profoundly positive consequence” of the works’ “unusual nature” \(2016, Painting in Time II, 20,608 visitors; E1; E8\). 

 As well as impacting on artists, makers and assistants, visitors to the exhibitions and participants in outreach and education programmes gained a greater understanding of collaboration within art practice and acquired knowledge of formerly unknown career opportunities and ways of working. A former art student who took part in the Artist Boss engagement programme said that the research “gave me new insight into how artists navigated their careers, how important other people were to their practice”, while another said: “Artist Boss opened my eyes to the idea of making work that wasn't just my own or for myself” \(E5\). These insights opened up new avenues of professional practice and potential careers for students, including art school technician, furniture maker and studio assistant \(E5\). Testimonials from these alumni demonstrate the lasting impact of the research on their careers, with one saying that: “Artist Boss recognised that this IS a way of living for an artist, and I concur. The influence and physicality of being around working artists and making work for others feeds your own creativity”, while another said that Artist Boss “has continued to influence my studio practice as a multidisciplinary artist” \(E5\). 

###  Bringing audiences into contact with the process of making art objects 

### -  creating new understandings of exhibiting and making art 

### -  creating new understandings of materials and new relationships between objects, materials, makers, carers and audiences 

 Research carried out by Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd has brought audiences closer to the processes and materials involved in the making of art, and in doing so has succeeded in breaking down the distance between art object and audience, as well as expanding and enriching audiences’ understanding of what constitutes a work of art or an exhibition. 

 A visitor to *Elbow* \(2015, C&C gallery, London; 1 blind consultant and 1 assistant, 1 gallery assistant, 2 gallery directors, 2 marketing staff; 400 participants by active involvement, 4230 live audience, 10,000 online, E8\) commented: “Nice to see a gallery looking at disability as an issue rather than just showing paintings, I didn’t know art could do that” *,* while another stated “I really enjoyed learning how the process came about and that the focus is on the process itself rather than what they are making” \(E2, p1\). These comments demonstrate that the research altered visitors’ understanding of art and challenged their notions of exhibiting and making art \(E2\). 

 Dunseath’s outreach and participation work as part of *Artist Boss* has impacted on students’ and teachers’ understandings of materials, technologies, and collaborations \(workshops, crits and talks, over 690 students, teachers and pupils; E2, E5\). Art students responded to technical discussions of joining and making, with one commenting: “Before this project I had not seen how new technologies were being used in art”, while another said: “It supported my interest in sculpture, and supported it as a viable approach. How artists are using, interpreting or trying to push the parameters of a new technology, process or material” \(E5\). Encounters with new materials, technologies and artists impacted on these art students’ perception of the discipline and their own professional practice. 

 By bringing gallery visitors and participants into direct contact with materials and their transformations, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd’s research allows them to play a part in witnessing and creating new knowledge and new understandings. An artist\-writer’s account of Kidd’s *Overfill* \( *Painting in Time*, The Tetley, 2015; 6149 visitors, E8\) discussed the relationship between art object, materials, studio assistant and audience: “the gallery attendants become implicated in the work, the paintings ‘marked’ by their ‘care’ and in a sense becoming ‘documents’ of this ‘care’ – the visitor taking on the role of witness within this process” \(E1\). Director of Exhibition Operations at the Chicago exhibition said that Kidd’s work succeeded in engaging with its audience “in its making” and continues to do so “in the memory of that making”, while a studio assistant at The Tetley said the work had a **“live\-ness”** and **“sparked a real material interest from audiences, an inquisitiveness, curiosity, playful”** \(E1\). 

 Visitors to Mute \(2015, National Museum Wales; 45,775 visitors, E8\) were actively involved in the exhibition, being invited to play brass music from 2 turntables into slip\-filled speakers, with the aim of breaking down the clay and exposing the internal sound. Over the course of the exhibition, visitors added to the record collection on display. Artists, writers, students and photographers who visited the exhibition were moved to write about and share images and videos of Mute; one wrote about how the installation “invites the public” to take part, saying: “being invited to make a load of noise on turntables is always a fun proposition, and I can now \(technically\) claim to have DJd the National Museum of Wales\!” \(E6, p1\). Another visitor, who took along some of his noisiest records to play, witnessed the “deterioration of these ceramics plates through sound” and said “I think it’s the most fun I had all year” \(E6, p1\). These comments demonstrate the interactive and joyful experience of engaging with this artwork, which turned the gallery from a place of quiet, distant contemplation to one of welcoming interaction. 

 As well as creating new ways of engaging with art practice and shifting perceptions of authorship and hierarchy in art, Dunseath, Harrison and Kidd have effected changes in the programming and curating of cultural events. Plymouth City’s Plan for Public Art \(2016\) cites Harrison’s work as a case study that demonstrates “the capacity of the city and the city’s artists to produce ambitious work” \(E3\). A city council commissioned report \(2016\) found that Heavy Rock’s collaborative approach had resulted in Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery creating “valuable new partnerships with a range of organisations in the city, including the Royal Navy and the marine engineers, Babcock International”, while the project had also “forged new working relations between the museum and the visual arts community in the city” \(E3\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Pseudotype viruses \(PV\) developed by Dr Nigel Temperton at Kent are innovative, biosafe virus mimics. PV have been brought to two international companies \(VisMederi, Blue Water Vaccines\), two national companies \(MAP Diagnostics, DIOSynVax\), and a UK Government agency \(NIBSC\), with cost savings, time savings, and increased safety reported as key benefits. This technology has: 1\) enabled the rapid development of reference standards for influenza and WHO Blueprint Pathogens \(NIBSC\-Virology\); 2\) facilitated the development of a SARS\-CoV\-2 clinical diagnostic test \(MAP Diagnostics\); 3\) accelerated vaccine R&D \(VisMederi, DioSynVax, Blue Water Vaccines\); and 4\) enabled screening of antibodies with potential therapeutic applications \(NIBSC\-Biotherapeutics\). Specifically, NIBSC\-Virology produced reference standards for Ebola, MERS\-CoV, and SARS\-CoV\-2. SARS\-CoV\-2 pseudotypes were successfully employed as direct assay standards by MAP Diagnostics. A new PV\-based assay \(PV\-ELLA\) for the measurement of response to neuraminidase in influenza vaccines was co\-developed with VisMederi. A SARS\-CoV\-2 vaccine \(DIOSCoVax\) and a trivalent Ebola/Marburg/Lassa Fever vaccine were developed at DIOSynVax, and have moved to Phase 1 clinical trials, and PV technology has sped up Blue Water Vaccines’ and DIOSynVax’s universal influenza programs.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since 2009, Temperton’s team at Kent have pioneered the design, construction, and deployment of pseudotype viruses \(PV\) **\[R1\-R6; G1\-G3\]**. These are biosafe, replication\-defective viruses \(retroviruses and lentiviruses\) with foreign viral glycoproteins derived from the viral envelope of the pathogen under investigation on their surface. These glycoproteins are important for viral entry into the host cell, and thus PV mimic the pathogenic virus with respect to cell entry, but are safer to work with, as they cannot replicate and make progeny viruses once inside the cell. PV can thus be handled by end users in biosafety level 1/2 \(BSL\-1/2\) instead of BSL\-3/4 laboratories. In research published in 2014, Temperton and co\-workers demonstrated that PV are stable over a range of temperatures and can be freeze\-dried, enabling safe transport to end users and facilitating application in resource\-limited laboratories lacking cold\-storage facilities **\[R2\]**. 

 Pseudotypes **\[R1\-R6\]** developed by the Kent team also carry a quantifiable reporter that is integrated into the target cell genome on viral entry. The product of the reporter gene \(commonly a fluorescent or luminescent protein\) is readily detectable, enabling sensitive, high\-throughput cell entry\-based assays to be performed. Additionally, PV\-based assays are simple to upgrade, as only the nucleotide sequence of the surface glycoprotein\(s\) from the pathogenic virus is required. This makes them ideal for emerging RNA viruses \(avian influenza, rabies, SARS/MERS/SARS\-CoV\-2, ebola, and other WHO Blueprint priority pathogens\), which commonly evolve through mutation\(s\) arising in these sequences. 

 In 2011, Temperton’s expertise in pseudotype technology led to the creation of the Viral Pseudotype Unit \(VPU\) at Kent. Since then, the VPU has acted as an interface between academia, industry and animal and public health laboratories, with the purpose of translating Kent’s basic virus research into *in vitro* cell culture PV\-based assays that can be readily employed for the characterisation of vaccines, antivirals, and therapeutic antibodies **\[R1\-R6\]**. 

 Between 2011 and 2020, the Kent team used the VPU portfolio of pseudotypes to develop PV\-based neutralization assays, which provide a measure of how efficiently antibodies neutralise viral infection and demonstrated their use in immunogenicity testing of vaccines and the characterisation of broadly neutralising antibodies **\[R1, R3, R4\]**. Temperton’s research showed that PV assays are serum and antigen sparing requiring relatively fewer reagents than standard assays, and functional antibody responses correlate strongly with live pathogenic virus assays **\[R1, R5, R6\]**, resulting in a significant safety benefit and cost saving for the end\-user given the exorbitant costs and health risk of undertaking serological \(serum\-based\) assays with high\-containment viruses **\[R1\-R6\]**. 

 Neutralisation assays carried out using bespoke panels of Temperton’s influenza PV have been shown to be exquisitely sensitive for the measurement of responses to the HA stalk \(a conserved region of the hemagglutinin \(HA\) viral coat protein\), one of the primary targets of many big pharma ‘universal’ vaccine approaches **\[R1\]**. The availability of these PV influenza panels for use in neutralisation assays is advantageous to end users as the traditional hemagglutinin inhibition assay \(for which a correlate of immunity exists\) used by the regulators only measures responses against the globular HA head and is not fit for purpose for the licensing of many of these new ‘universal’ vaccines. 

 Isolating single domain antibodies \(sdAbs\) from camelids is a key therapeutic avenue for many viral diseases. Due to their exquisite sensitivity, Temperton’s influenza PV panels have been instrumental in the characterization of broadly neutralizing sdAbs isolated for influenza A and B **\[R1, R3\]**. Using PV\-based neutralisation assays, Temperton with NIBSC\-Biotherapeutics showed that one of these antibodies, R1a\-B6 , which targets the HA stalk, can protect against multiple subtypes of influenza when delivered by an adeno\-associated viral \(AAV\) vector, making it critical for informing universal influenza vaccine design **\[R1, G1, G2\]**. 

 Temperton’s research has also highlighted the use of PV neutralisation assays in the production of accredited reference standards for WHO Blueprint list priority viruses **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1\) Rapid development of reference standards for Ebola, Lassa Fever, MERS\-CoV and SARS\-CoV\-2 using pseudotype technology** 

 The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control \(NIBSC\) has identified pseudotypes as a technology that can facilitate the development of accredited reference standards in a significantly shorter timeframe **\[a\]**, which is particularly important for emerging viruses. Collaboration between Temperton and NIBSC, initiated in 2015, resulted in the development of WHO\-accredited nucleic acid and antibody reference reagents for Ebola **\[b\]**. Mark Page \(Head of the Emerging Viruses Group at NIBSC\) states that ‘most of the WHO R&D Blueprint are pathogens in hazard group 3 or 4’, and that Temperton’s PV have been identified by NIBSC ‘an essential tool for the characterisation of candidate reference reagents, alleviating the need to work at a high containment level, which for Ebola would not have been possible as NIBSC does not possess a CL4 laboratory’ **\[a\]**. Temperton’s PV\-based neutralisation assays were critical for the evaluation of the Ebola plasma standard and PV were essential for production of the nucleic acid test \(NAT\) standards that are made by packaging the Ebola genome inside Temperton\-designed retroviral pseudotype particles. Without access to Temperton’s pseudotype technology, these standards would have taken significantly longer to develop and release. Page confirms that ‘The use of pseudotype viruses for the development of reference material has now been adopted by default at NIBSC and permits the production of standards to a responsive and fluent timeframe for the priority pathogens listed in the WHO R&D Blueprint’, and further states that ‘The impact of this is that NIBSC has been made an implementing partner with Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations \(CEPI\) \[…\] to produce antibody standards to enable vaccine development against priority pathogens’ **\[a\]**. In February 2019, NIBSC, enabled by Temperton’s pseudotype technology, leveraged contracts from CEPI for 1m USD to produce standards for Lassa fever virus **\[a\]**, and, in collaboration with Temperton, NIBSC have also produced reference reagents for MERS\-CoV and SARS\-CoV\-2 ‘with an accelerated time frame’ \[R6\] **\[a\]**. Page concludes that ‘There will always be the potential for \[…\] outbreaks that could have global impact and the VPU and NIBSC alliance is ideally suited to respond to the next emergency’ **\[a\]**. 

 **2\) Employing SARS\-CoV\-2 pseudotypes as direct assay standards for clinical diagnostic tests** 

 In 2020, UKRI funded the Humoral Immune Correlates of COVID\-19 \(HICC\) consortium, which is comprised of a core of founder members in receipt of direct funding \(University of Cambridge, Kent Viral Pseudotype Unit. MAP Diagnostics, Royal Papwoth and Addenbrookes NHS Trusts\) and a large network of collaborators **\[G3\]**, to carry out SARS\-CoV\-2 research into immune correlates. In 2020, a collaboration between Temperton and the diagnostics company MAP Diagnostics \(Bedford, UK\), which develops novel diagnostic tests based around MALDI\-ToF mass spectrometry, was initiated via HICC **\[c\].** This collaboration involves the use of Temperton’s SARS\-CoV\-2 pseudotypes directly as assay standards. MAP Diagnostics is developing SARS\-CoV\-2 clinical diagnostic tests based on direct MALDI\-ToF mass spectral analysis of gargle/saliva samples, and Temperton’s pseudotypes have been incorporated into the company’s protocols, enabling safer and rapid methods development at reduced cost **\[c\]**. Professor Ray Iles \(CEO of MAP Diagnostics\) states: ‘The COVID\-19 pandemic prompted the development of a mass spectral technique for identification of viral envelope proteins direct from gargle/saliva samples. This would not have been possible without the use of SARS\-2 pseudo\-type, and other corona viral pseudo\-types, developed by Dr Temperton’s research’ **\[c\]**. The timely availability of ‘safe to manipulate mock \[pseudotype\] virus; with the same biochemical, conformational and physical biology of the target proteins in situ within a viral\-like envelope exosome, allowed not only the spectral but pre\-processing biochemistry to be developed in a non CAT3 restrictive laboratory setting’ **\[c\]**. Isles further states that their protocol is now ‘being adopted by other mass spectral analysis centres’, and the company is sending Temperton’s pseudotypes ‘to global collaborators as a quality and positive control to be run with every diagnostic test’ **\[c\]**. In addition to using Temperton’s SARS\-CoV\-2 pseudotypes, Isles states that, via collaboration with Temperton, ‘Other viral pseudo\-types are being tested in order to discover the \[…\] “spectral fingerprint” of virus infections’, and highlights that ‘the cost, speed and utility of the technique is going to have major impacts on global health care and disease diagnosis beyond the COVID\-19 pandemic’ **\[c\]**. The assays used by HICC and MAP Diagnostics are all calibrated using the NIBSC SARS\-CoV\-2 reference reagents **\[R6\]**. 

 **3\) Applying the pseudotype virus platform to vaccine research and development for influenza, SARS\-CoV\-2, Marburg and Lassa Fever** 

 Temperton has a longstanding collaboration with VisMederi \(Siena, Italy\), which undertakes serological assays for pharma and towards licensure of influenza, coronavirus, and other vaccines **\[d\]**. Temperton’s influenza and SARS\-CoV\-2 neutralisation assays and know\-how have been successfully translated to VisMederi via this collaboration, and in 2016 a new PV\-based enzyme\-linked lectin assay \(PV\-ELLA\) was co\-developed that enables the measurement of responses to neuraminidase \(NA\) in influenza vaccines **\[d\]**. This new assay is highlighted by CEO Professor Emanuele Montomoli: ‘In 2016, a VisMederi researcher, Fabrizio Biuso, joined Nigel Temperton’s laboratory for refining the \[…\] pseudotypes platform. In particular the project \[…\] aimed to study the development of \[an\] ELLA assay \[…\] to evaluate human anti\-NA antibodies’ **\[d\]**. According to Montomoli, the transfer of Temperton’s PV technology ‘allowed VisMederi to execute several clinical and preclinical studies and it was \[…\] applied to Flu, Rabies and now \[in 2020\] it will be useful \[…\] in SARS CoV\-2 studies in order to accelerate the development of SARS\-CoV\-2 assays’ **\[d\]**. Montomoli states that working with PV will ‘eliminate the need \[… for\] wild\-type virus, meaning \[…\] this assay can be performed at biosafety level II \(BSL2\)’, and that ‘R&D of this nature would be laborious and expensive to perform with the native virus’, confirming that ‘the collaboration with Nigel Temperton \[…\] saved costs to the company and increased the staff safety level’ **\[d\]**. 

 Temperton has been collaborating with DIOSynVax, a Cambridge University spin\-out company, since 2017. Professor Jonathan Heeney, CEO of DIOSynVax, explains that DIOSynVax is focused on vaccine R&D using a technology platform that encompasses a computational approach ‘for the rapid selection of vaccine antigens that are able to elicit cross protective immune responses to an array of different viruses’ **\[e\]**. Temperton acted as a scientific advisor from September 2016, and sought to develop a trivalent vaccine to protect against Ebola, Marburg and Lassa Fever. Heeney states that ‘The project included successful animal trials and the vaccine has now moved to Phase 1 clinical trials’ **\[e\]**. Temperton’s PV\-based serological assays form a key component of the company’s new technology platform, and scientists at DIOSynVax are routinely trained in PV development, production, and deployment with Temperton’s support **\[e\]**. Heeney states that ‘The PV assays are integral to the vaccine development pipeline as the data is fed back into machine learning processes to improve vaccine antigen selection’, and that ‘R&D of this nature would usually be laborious and expensive to perform with the native virus, however, our process design enables adaptability to new virus strains and is \[…\] safer for staff to work with’ **\[e\]**. According to Heeney, results obtained using Temperton’s PV assays have underpinned ‘successful grant applications’ that have enabled the company to ‘move into new areas of vaccine R&D’. Current collaborative projects include vaccine development for influenza **\[G1, G2\]** and coronavirus, with the DIOS\-CoVax vaccine having recently received funding to enter a Phase 1 clinical trial **\[e\]**. Protective Ab responses and critical readouts for clinical trials of COVID\-19 vaccines including DIOS\-CoVax are being addressed in a joint\-funded NIHR project \[G3\]. 

 In 2018, Temperton’s collaboration with Oxford University on the discovery of a new ‘universal’ influenza vaccine epitope, which involved the use of the Kent team’s PV\-based neutralisation assays **\[R4\]**, resulted in a US\-based spin\-out company, Blue Water Vaccines. The company’s vaccine program aims to commercialise a vaccine that could protect against all influenza strains and provide life\-long immunity. Dr Craig Thompson \(CEO at Blue Water Vaccines\) states that ‘our relationship with Dr Temperton has centred around the pseudotyped virus assay technology his lab has developed \[…\]. This technology has become central to the discovery of novel antigen targets as part of our influenza vaccine program’ **\[f\]**. Thompson confirms that the use of Temperton’s PV\-based neutralisation assay has enabled the assessment of ‘protective neutralising antibody responses \[…\] under CL2 conditions’, and that ‘Without this assay we would need to work under more restrictive CL3 or SAPO4 conditions using live influenza virus, which would be impossible to undertake at the scale we require. Consequently, our use of the \[…\] assay has sped up the development of our influenza vaccine’ **\[f\]**. Thompson also states that the provision of laboratory assistance, constructs, and techniques developed by the Kent team ‘has been vital in expanding the range of influenza glycoproteins analysed’ by the company **\[f\]**. 

 **4\) Enabling isolation and characterisation of antibodies with potential immune prophylaxis and vaccine potency application through the use of pseudotype neutralisation assays** 

 Since 2017, Temperton has built a strong relationship with NIBSC Biotherapeutics, which discovers and develops single domain antibodies \(sdAbs\). They have been using Temperton’s influenza pseudotypes in neutralisation assays for first\-line screening to identify broadly neutralising sdAbs with potential therapeutic, diagnostic, and vaccine potency application **\[R1, R3\]**. Live pathogenic viruses could not have been used in such assays owing to the exorbitant costs and safety constraints associated with the running of their R&D screening pipeline under high containment **\[g\]**. Through this partnership, Dr Hufton has additionally leveraged funding from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority \(BARDA\) in the US to ‘develop an influenza vaccine potency assay based on broad neutralising and lineage specific single domain antibodies. This “universal” assay will ultimately reduce the need for the seasonal generation of strain specific reagents and so speed up the influenza vaccine development pipeline.’ **\[g\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Essex research has <ins>revolutionised on\-chip debug, monitoring and analytics to deliver world leading on\-chip diagnostic solutions</ins> via commercialisation by UltraSoC Technologies, a company whose creation and growth has been underpinned by Essex research. These solutions ensure correct functionality of complex microchips, substantially accelerate product development and ensure correct operation of the deployed systems in many, often safety critical, domains.  Since August 2013, UltraSoC has <ins>attracted investment worth over</ins> <ins>USD</ins> <ins>20 million</ins> and has licensed this technology to <ins>more than 20 leading edge start\-ups and Tier 1 semiconductor</ins> companies including ARM, Huawei, Microsemi, Intel, Seagate and Western Digital. Employing this technology enables SoC design teams to <ins>double their profitability</ins> and <ins>reduce their design costs by 25%</ins>. UltraSoC’s technology is also emerging as the <ins>de\-facto standard</ins> debug support interface for RISC\-V processor platform. UltraSoC so successfully enabled semiconductor industry customers to overcome manufacturing defects, software and hardware bugs, device early\-failure and wear\-out, as well as improve devices’ functional safety and malicious attack protection, <ins>that it was acquired by Siemens in 2020 to help the global technology powerhouse provide comparable support.</ins>

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since the early 2000s Multiprocessor Systems\-on\-a\-Chip \(MPSoC\) have become extensively used in electronic systems. Such platforms are now <ins>commonplace in everyday life</ins> and underpin a vast array of consumer items including cars, smartphones and household appliances. The successful development of these products relies on, on\-chip de\-bugging and analysis in a short timeframe. However, the advancement of SoC technology, and particularly the move towards MPSoCs, rendered previous software debugging strategies obsolete, unreliable or insufficient. Traditionally these strategies were focused on providing debug support for chips comprising single processors, or multiple processors of a specific family of processor architectures. 

 Professor Klaus McDonald\-Maier identified the <ins>need for support of software application development in SoC</ins> architectures, especially in cases where <ins>complex software</ins> is required to interact and execute on <ins>multiple processor cores</ins>. In cases where SoCs feature other highly interactive blocks \(which may contribute to undesired behaviour of the system\), this presented a significant technical challenge \[R1, R2\]. Beginning at the University of Essex in 2005, McDonald\-Maier and Hopkins worked on EPSRC funded projects \[G1 – G4\] that developed initial concepts to address this into practical implementations \[R3\]. McDonald\-Maier’s subsequent work \[e.g. G5 and G6\] expanded this technology \[R4\-6\]. 

 The research \[R3\] provided a <ins>highly modular debug support architecture</ins>, consisting of two important stages. Firstly, debug support adapters were provided in order to connect each processor core, peripheral or interconnect, to the debug infrastructure. The second stage then controlled these adapters, combining their debug data streams in order to preserve timing and compress resulting data to an absolute minimum. Critically, this compression meant that debug data could be straightforwardly sent from the SoC to an external development station or PC using a variety of limited bandwidth interfaces. This is an important characteristic because every product chip includes this additional debug infrastructure and therefore it is required in a high volume of devices. 

 The development of this process represented the <ins>first systems\-centric debug support architecture</ins> for SoCs featuring multiple processor cores \(i.e. cores from multiple IP provider such as ARM, MIPS etc. as well as other active peripherals\). The architecture <ins>substantially outperformed</ins> the state of the art \(i.e. <ins>by an order of magnitude</ins>\) and, notably, achieved this in a significantly more compact implementation than existing architectures. The developed process provides debug support for two processor cores using less logic than that required for one processor core when using previous state of the art. Core contributions focus on <ins>ease of integration</ins> of processors and other components from different vendors and improved detection capability for unusual events and capability to provide this during the deployment stage of the respective SoC and for cybersecurity purposes. 

 Further work from 2014 focused on increasing ease of integration and flexibility with a message\-based infrastructure and focus on detection capability for systems security and analytics \[R4\-5\]. The Essex research group continued to contribute to the development of this technology in UltraSoC, the University of Essex spinout established for its commercialisation on it, and Siemens, who acquired it. For instance, as part of EPSRC funded research projects SPIRIT \[G5\] and the EPSRC National Centre for Nuclear Robotics \[G6\], there was extensive direct collaboration, focusing on methods for on\-line detection of faults introduced through exposure to extreme environments such as radiation \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 UltraSoC was spun out to commercialise the debug and on\-chip analytics technology invented as part of EPSRC funded research \[G1\-G4\]. The company has subsequently been built around research undertaken by McDonald\-Maier and his Embedded and Intelligent Systems \(EIS\) laboratory at the University of Essex \[S1\]. The research group at Essex recognised that the outputs of their work \[R1\-R3\] held <ins>broad applicability</ins> for providing debug support to MPSoCs in a vast array of global scenarios that rely on embedded systems. In a marketplace where <ins>nearly half the cost of chip development</ins> <ins>was</ins> <ins>spent on de\-bugging activities</ins>, the novel architecture resulting from the research conducted at Essex enables development of <ins>more reliable software</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>having</ins> <ins>significant</ins> <ins>economic and safety implications</ins> in consumer electronics and safety\-critical applications \[S1\] \(self\-driving vehicle electronics exemplify this\). Essex researchers sought to share the capabilities and associated benefits of this technology with a wide audience and developed a robust strategy in order to transform research insight into practical benefit. This centred on a broad range of dissemination activities that *targeted investment* from a variety of sources, in order to help commercialise the technology via its spin\-out UltraSoC Technologies. 

 UltraSoC has developed significantly since August 2013 with Venture capital funding raised from the original series A investors Octopus and new investors led by electronic design legend and Chairman of UltraSoC, Prof Alberto Sangiovanni\-Vincentelli \(UBerkeley and co\-founder of Cadence and Synopsis, Atlante Ventures\) and expansion to <ins>new design centres</ins> in Bristol and Poland, increasing the number of employees from 12 in July 2013 to over 40 in 2020 \(FTEs: 40\) \[S1\]. UltraSoC raised significant rounds, with GBP 5M led by Atlante for the continued expansion of the UltraSoC team and its product portfolio to support <ins>all mainstream embedded processor</ins> platforms in 2017 \(see C21 of \[S2\]\) and  [UltraSoC secured new investment ](https://www.businessleader.co.uk/ultrasoc-secures-new-5m-investment/69388/)of GBP 5 M \(see C21 of \[S2\]\) and in 2019 an additional GBP 5M to focus on <ins>hardware security</ins> \(see C9 of \[S2\]\) [.](https://www.ultrasoc.com/ultrasoc-secures-5m-investment-to-target-safety-and-security-applications-with-its-embedded-analytics/) Recently, UltraSoC has revisited the work on analytics, originally undertaken in the RESIP \[G2\] and Espacenet \[G4\] grants, where this was employed for  [design space optimisation](https://www.ultrasoc.com/cycle-accurate-trace-boosts-performance-optimization-capabilities-ultrasoc-embedded-analytics-infrastructure/) and  [security applications](https://www.ultrasoc.com/ultrasoc-announces-next-generation-hardware-based-cybersecurity-products/) and expanded this towards applications in  [AI and Machine Learning](https://www.ultrasoc.com/ultrasoc-embedded-analytics-selected-support-wave-computings-tritonai-64-ip-platform/) \[R4\]. In June 2020, UltraSoC was <ins>acquired by Siemens</ins> \[S6\] to enable semiconductor industry customers overcome key pain points including manufacturing defects, software and hardware bugs, device early\-failure and wear\-out, functional safety, and malicious attacks \[S1\] and \[S3\]. \[S1\] confirms: 

 *‘The research undertaken by you and your EIS laboratory at the University Essex has provided the* 

 *technological foundations of the UltraSoC product portfolio and enabled us to build practical debug and analytic solutions which proved to be of such immense commercial and technological value they established UltraSoC as the world leading provider in the debug analytics and cybersecurity technology market. Consequently, UltraSoC was the company Siemens chose to acquire to achieve a step change in its activities in this market.’* \[S1\] 

 UltraSoC’s embedded analytics IP and debugging tools are used to monitor and boost the <ins>performance, reliability and safety</ins> of consumer electronics, safety\-critical vehicle electronics, AI chips, servers and high performance computing platforms. Early customer PMC\-Sierra, the fabless semiconductor company \(acquired by Microsemi in 2016\), used analytics and other monitoring tools within its disk drive controllers, which power a significant proportion of server chipsets globally. The monitors were used to collect detailed data on chip behaviour, while also shedding light on the performance of server infrastructure those SoCs support. “The hardware\-based approach can detect hard\-to\-identify issues \[making\] it substantially easier to home in on non\-fatal bugs.” \(see C23 of \[S2\]\). 

 <ins>Extensive licensing activity</ins> followed this breakthrough with PMC\-Sierra, with UltraSoC’s technology increasingly seen as the <ins>world leading on\-chip analytics capability</ins> to enable companies to bring their products to market rapidly, resulting in a series of technology licenses to global companies like ARM \(2016 see C20 of \[S2\]\), HiSilicon \(Huawei, 2016\), Esperanto \(2017, see C18 of \[S2\]\), Mircosemi \(2017\), Movidius \(Intel, 2016\), Alibaba \(2018, see C17 of \[S2\]\), Kraftway \(2018, see C15 of \[S2\]\), Seagate \(2019, see C9 of \[S2\]\) and Western Digital \(2019 see C9 of \[S2\]\). UltraSoC achieved 100% client retention; all licensees continued their engagement with UltraSoC, renewing and expanding their licenses. This was facilitated by its universal monitoring and analytic system to support rapid ‘plug and play’ integration of semiconductor IP blocks from different vendors \(e.g. processors from ARM, MIPS, RISC\-V etc.\), enabling to effectively support mixed IP SoCs with a minimum of engineering effort \(see C29 of \[S2\]\) and fully support this via respective tools integration through its partners Andes, Arm, Cadence/Tensilica, Imperas, Lauterbach, Mentor, Percepio, Segger, SiFive, and Sondrel \[S1\]. 

 UltraSoC’s technology has had a <ins>distinct impact</ins> on the economics of the semiconductor industry, where its “intelligent analytics’ closed the productivity gap created by the failure of traditional SoC development methodologies to keep pace with escalating systemic complexity. Providing engineering teams actionable insights that shorten the total development cycle time, accelerate debug, and reduce risk and cost to ensure timely market entry. Analysis from SemiCo research demonstrates the bottom\-line value of this approach – SoC design teams can <ins>double their profitability</ins> and <ins>reduce their development costs by a quarter</ins> by using UltraSoC \[S1\]. Thus, UltraSoC’s in chip monitoring is increasingly seen as an essential part of coping with “rising complexity and a spectrum of possible interactions” \(see C23 of \[S2\]\) which is particularly vital for the monitoring and analytics for automotive and safety\-critical systems, increasingly important for self\-driving and autonomous systems \(see C13 of \[S2\]\), where it is necessary to “adopt a new approach of looking inside the electronics.” With “On\-chip monitoring … allowing continuous measurement of previously\-inaccessible information … so that users can actually take corrective action at every stage.” \(see C25 of \[S2\]\). These on\-chip monitoring mechanism also provide <ins>key capabilities for systems level cybersecurity</ins> through its Lockstep Monitor \(See C22 of \[S2\]\) and its Sentinel technology \[S5 and S6\], this is also evidenced by UltraSoCs selection into the major DARPA Automatic Implementation of Secure Silicon programme to enable “scalable defence mechanisms into chip designs” \(see C30 of \[S2\]\). 

 Additionally, UltraSoC provides the only commercial grade debug solution for emerging ARM alternative Open Source processor core platform RISC\-V \(see C1 and C2 of \[S2\]\) with its “standards\-compliant RISC\-V trace solution is a <ins>major contribution</ins> … to create <ins>a comprehensive ecosystem</ins> that delivers robust, commercial grade open\-source platforms” \(C1 of \[S2\]\). 

 UltraSoC’s development of novel chip design technology which addresses the big problem of complex Integrated circuit design was recognised at the <ins>2015 Elektra Awards</ins>. At the European ‘Oscars’ of the electronic Industry, UltraSoC was named <ins>Best New Company</ins>. The judges were impressed by its partnerships with leading firms for its patented IC debug tools, which are already making an impact in global semiconductor markets. \[S4\] Its cybersecurity focused version of the technology was recognised with selection as finalist for the <ins>Embedded Solution Product of the Year</ins> in the 2020 Electronic Industry Awards \[S5\] and with the <ins>Best in Show Security Award</ins> at the globally leading <ins>Embedded World 2020</ins> trade show \[S6\]. 

 Finally, the General Manager, Siemens Digital Industries Software and Tessent Vice President confirms: “ *Siemens’ acquisition of UltraSoC means that for the first time our customers can access not just design\-for\-test, but a comprehensive ‘Design for Lifecycle Management’ solution for system\-on\-chips, including functional safety, security and optimization*,” Adding: “ *By utilizing design augmentation to detect, mitigate and eliminate risks throughout the SoC lifecycle, customers can radically improve time\-to\-revenue, product quality & safety, and profitability. UltraSoC has a fast\-growing business and impressive customer list and, as part of Siemens, can complement Tessent to create a truly unique offering in the market*.” \[S3\].  Siemens also confirms that “ *UltraSoC is a pioneer of embedding monitoring hardware into complex SoCs to enable “fab\-to\-field” analytics capabilities designed to accelerate silicon bring\-up, optimize product performance, and confirm that devices are operating “as designed” for functional safety and cybersecurity purposes*.” \[S3\]. All this from the company with a product portfolio founded on, and practical debug and analytic solutions enabled by research led by McDonald\-Maier at the University Essex \[S1\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 *The Depraved Appetite of Tarrare the Freak* is a practice\-based research project, presented as a puppet chamber opera exploring the true story of 18<sup>th</sup>\-century French medical anomaly Tarrare who had polyphagia \(excessive appetite\), which challenged perceptions of non\-normative bodies and deconstructed the medical gaze \(which pathologises physical difference\). This project addressed negative perceptions of non\-normative bodies that affect public attitudes towards such bodies as well as treatment of patients in medical and arts\-based support and therapeutic contexts. 

 The project changed perceptions of non\-normative and othered bodies by audience members through the show’s portrayal of Tarrare and his story. The main outcome, an original puppet chamber opera funded by the Wellcome Trust and Arts Council England, influenced audience perceptions using puppetry, music and narrative to generate empathy for Tarrare. It also changed perceptions of and approaches to patients by medical and arts\-based support and therapeutic professionals, through experiential work with puppets that allow for new ways of understanding how unique and non\-normative bodies move in the world. The supporting public engagement event and puppetry workshops facilitated new understandings for arts\-based support and therapeutic professionals and medical professionals, by asking them to build and manipulate non\-normative bodies in a way that is led by the body itself and not by their expectations of it. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Purcell\-Gates’ research has developed a model of puppetry as a practice\-based analytic to deepen understanding of ethical and historical issues within the medical humanities. Public attitudes towards anomalous bodies are shaped by negative perceptions of such bodies that circulate in the media and within popular discourses. Additionally, disability rights advocates campaign for a change in perceptions of disabled, injured or ill patients by the medical establishment, which frames their bodies as collections of symptoms \(Foucault’s medical or clinical gaze\) and stands in the way of the patient narrative; instead advocates encourage a system in which the patient’s voice is listened to as part of treatment and healing. This medical/clinical gaze is traced back to the advent of modern medicine in Europe at the end of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, the time frame in which Tarrare’s story is set. The case study of Tarrare was a relatively unknown but deeply significant example of the shift from the holistic medical approach \(focused on the patient narrative\) to the medical/clinical gaze approach \(framing patients’ bodies as collections of body parts\); it is significant that Tarrare’s doctor, the famous surgeon Baron Percy, referred to Tarrare as a ‘monster’. Tarrare’s real\-life medical treatment and autopsy is portrayed in the show to explore this significant shift in medical ideology and the doctor\-patient relationship. 

 In the *Tarrare* project, Purcell\-Gates investigated the use of puppets to both portray and critique the medical gaze. The research focused primarily on determining the unique properties of puppetry that allow for interrogation of anomalous bodies. These were found to include the ability to construct puppet bodies to literally enact embodied experience \(eg an absence of the lower torso of Tarrare made literal the perpetual sense of emptiness in his stomach\) and the ability to use non\-realist modes of embodiment to signify non\-normative embodied experience \(eg a hand reaching out of Tarrare’s mouth to grasp food signified Tarrare’s extreme appetite\). The research was conducted through research and development of the original puppet chamber opera *The Depraved Appetite of Tarrare the Freak* through development sessions and rehearsals of the show \(R1, R4\). 

 Through the research and development and rehearsal stages of the project, the research also considered how puppetry can be deployed to interrogate ethical issues around representing the historical other on stage \(R1, R4\). This included the issue of the absence of Tarrare’s voice in the archive, interrogated through the construction of Tarrare as a ‘corpse\-like’ puppet in the autopsy room, re\-animated by live performers \(R1\). It also included historiographic displacement of conventional historical narratives of the ‘progress’ of modern medicine, interrogated through enacting Tarrare’s medical treatment as the literal manipulation of an object \- the puppet \(R1, R2\). 

 Furthermore, the research examined how puppetry can deepen understandings of the doctor\-patient relationship and modern medicine’s shift to the medical gaze \(R1, R2, R4\). This was accomplished through using puppetry to materialise the medical gaze: playing on the simultaneous subject/object ontology of puppets to frame the puppets as both dead corpses in an autopsy room and apparently living figures within a living story \(R1, R3\). This approach was instigated through collaborative consultations with medical students on the University of Bristol’s Intercalated BA in Medical Humanities \(iBAMH\) course, who conducted research on the emergence of the medical gaze at the time of Tarrare’s life, led by Purcell\-Gates as Creative Director of Puppetry for the show \(R1, R4\). The actions, struggles and failures of the doctor Baron Percy as he attempts to diagnose and cure Tarrare, and the autopsy he performs on Tarrare’s dead body which begins and ends the show, were developed in consultation with pathologist Dr Alan Bates \(University College London\) who was brought on as Co\-Investigator when the Wellcome Trust funded the project, with Purcell\-Gates as Primary Investigator \(R1, R4\). Consultations with disability scholar Professor David Turner on the holistic model of patient treatment informed both the show and the related puppetry workshops on the differences between the social and medical models of disability, which developed the uses of puppetry as an applied theatre practice \(R1, R2, R4, R5, R6\). 

 This additionally resulted in a Research Programme \(R4\) co\-authored by Purcell\-Gates, Bates, Turner and Dr John Lee, director of the iBAMH course at University of Bristol and medical students on the course, which explained to audience members the research behind the show, how this informed the show’s puppet design and libretto, and several of the show’s key themes. This included Bates’s reflections on how participating in the project allowed him to understand the discipline of pathology in a new light and how telling the story of Tarrare casts new light on the medical profession \(‘Looking for the Golden Fork’\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Purcell\-Gates’ research, and the resulting performance, help to deconstruct the medical gaze in relation to perceptions of and behaviour towards people with anomalous bodies. The project changed audience members’ perceptions of non\-normative bodies and influenced perceptions of and approaches towards patients by medical, arts\-based support and therapeutic professionals. By using puppetry to both investigate and portray the Tarrare story, the treatment of puppets was able to be used as an analytic to enact and more clearly understand the act of performing the medical gaze. Puppets can be viewed as literal collections of body parts, dead objects that take on life through human manipulation, much as patient bodies are manipulated by doctors. 

###  Influencing audience perceptions of non\-normative bodies 

 The show prompted audience members and reviewers to think about and question the historical and medical context of Tarrare’s life and prompted them in particular to think differently about non\-normative bodies including Tarrare’s, performers in freak shows, and medical patients. The show provoked empathy for Tarrare in the form of deeper and more nuanced understanding his condition. Audience members articulated this in their perspective on Tarrare: “He's in the grip of something he can't control” and “he is stuck in this image of himself where all he has is hunger and no one can help him as it's such a strong urge”. Another audience member stated: “It also made me wonder whether Tarrare's emptiness was related to his mental health and loneliness as well as a physical cause for his appetite” \(E1\), demonstrating empathy. 

 The show provoked both disgust and sympathy for Tarrare, prompting audience members to feel positively towards a person even as they perceive them as disgusting: 

 It’s very physical, disgusting and it's uncomfortable to watch. But I feel the despair in his emotional and physical state \(E1\) 

 Other responses highlighted this dual response: “\[I feel\] Slight revulsion and sympathy for his vomiting so much” and “I feel disgusted…But I also feel sorry for him because he cannot help the fact that he has this condition” \(E1\). Tarrare’s relationship with Celeste, another main character, also provoked new ways of understanding him as a whole person: 

 She sees through the ‘freak’ side of him as she is also seen as one and can instead see the real human behind the stigma \(E1\) 

 She does not see him as a freak, but as a beautiful and unique being who deserves a life without torment, mockery and shame \(E1\) 

 Through the relationship with Celeste, audiences were moved to share: “He is unique so special”; “He is a special individual like herself”; “a beauty beneath the horror” \(E1\). 

 The portrayal of Baron Percy and the medical establishment in the show changed audience perceptions of how non\-normative bodies can be treated within the medical establishment: “The methods are not suited to him but are the only things the doctors knew so they were trying, he then just sort of became an experiment to any procedure and his welfare did not get thought about” \(E1\). One audience member shared: “I believe that \[the doctor\] truly wanted to help him, but perhaps it was for his own benefit and gain, so that he could be seen as the one who cured the freak?” \(E1\). The show’s final image of the head in the jar provoked deeper reflection on how we perceive non\-normative bodies: “we saw the body but not the insides, seeing this shows how his body worked to some extent and shows what was underneath him, no freak, just organs, genetically different but still human” and **“Tarrare was treated like a “specimen” and not like a human by most around him”** \(E1\). 

 The live show reached 5,083 audience members, and the online video of the show had over 10,000 views between March and December 2020. The show received 23 reviews from publications including *The Times* and *The Stage* and interviews with the creative team were featured 3 times \(including in *The Guardian* and on BBC1 and BBC3; E2\). The reviews reference the show’s creation of empathy for the non\-normative figure of Tarrare as well as the foregrounding of how non\-normative bodies are presented and displayed in freak shows and problematising audience relationship to this form of spectacle: 

 It might well be that this is where the genius of the production lies, that the cast and creative team have really cleverly co\-opted the audience into being exactly who they said they would never be: the people who enjoy freak shows. \(E2\) 

 This was echoed by audience members who saw their own complicity in the positioning of ‘freaks’ in society in new ways: “The audience could be seen as the audience that are just watching the freaks, in a way it's like we let that happen” \(E1\). 

###  Changing perceptions of medical professionals by deconstructing the medical gaze 

 Purcell\-Gates’ research led to medical and nursing students shifting their perceptions of patients and developing new ways of thinking about the relationship between medical staff and patients, including a more holistic approach to patients. This was achieved by the creative team working with medical and nursing students in the development of the show, through workshops on the differences between medical and social models of disability. This was shared as part of the *Performing the Freak* public engagement event which toured to several HEIs and arts venues \(E7\). 

 One of the project’s core partners was the intercalated BA in Medical Humanities programme at Bristol University. Approximately 24 medical students in 2 year groups \(2013\-14 and 2014\-15\) worked closely on the project with Purcell\-Gates, engaging in independent research around key questions of the show, then met with Purcell\-Gates for in\-depth discussions based on their findings \(E6\). 3 students in the 2013\-14 cohort participated in the 2013 public engagement event ‘Performing the Freak’ at Tobacco Factory Theatres \(Bristol\) in which they discussed ways in which working on the show helped them think in new ways about their future vocation as doctors \(E3, E6\). Medical students involved in the project reported a transformative effect on their approach to medicine and their future vocation as doctors, including questioning the ‘monstrosity’ of doctors, realising the ways in which the medical establishment dehumanises patients, and powerful and new understandings of the history of medicine, the medical gaze and the holistic approach to the patient \(E3\). 

 Purcell\-Gates ran a puppetry workshop on differences between the medical versus social models of disability for 17 nursing students at Ulster University on 27 June 2019. The workshop facilitated a change in perception of nursing students’ relationships to their patients, with a shift towards a more holistic understanding of patient experience. From watching puppets in the workshop, the nursing students understood the importance of reading a patient’s body language: “It made me think more about the patients I care for, their body language and what I can read from them” and “Focus and attention on the puppet made me think of the importance of observing patients, paying attention and observing patients from their body movement to identify their needs” \(E4\). Focusing on the patient extended beyond observation and students made connections between interactions with puppets in the workshop and the importance of patient\-focused care: “Focusing on the individual and not what's around you”; “Letting the patient be in control of their care and following/supporting their journey”; “Focusing on puppet is like focusing on 'patient' within hospital setting” \(E4\). The nursing students felt that engaging with puppets in the workshop reminded them of the importance of holistic care, not forcing bodies to do things, letting patients be in charge of their care, and allowing them to empathise with individuals in their care: “The workshop on Puppetry is very beneficial to Nurse training as it allows us to Engage, show sympathetic presence, \[and\] Empathise” \(E4\). This was specifically connected to an intervention in the medical gaze: “Looking at the individual as a person and not the patient”; “Shift in seeing patient as individual \(not as patient\)” \(E4\). 

###  Changing perceptions and practice of arts\-based support and therapeutic professionals 

 The research into medical versus social models of disability also led to practice\-based workshops. A puppetry workshop run by Purcell\-Gates for 29 applied theatre professionals at the Broken Puppet 3 Symposium on 17 April 2019 led to a change in applied theatre professionals’ perceptions around non\-normative bodies and a change in their approaches to their work with people with non\-normative bodies. The applied theatre professionals were from the UK and Europe and included arts psychotherapists, dramatherapists, puppetry therapists, child psychotherapists, puppetry practitioners with hospitalised children, puppetry therapists with refugees and children, and professional puppeteers working in applied settings. 

 Participants gained new understandings of the ways in which puppetry is a useful tool for discussing disability and reframing disability in positive terms, stating: “Take your body/puppet as it is and let it work. Puppet makes disability into more\-ability = mobility = new unknown movements. This seldom works in reality. But the idea of turning something ‘bad’ into something ‘good’ is wonderful and hopeful” and **“Not seeing movement limitations of the puppet as a flaw \- their individual movement can create character”** \(E5\). The use of puppets helped participants to feel empathetic and some thought this was a useful tool to spark empathy and understanding in others. Participants stated this approach was “Ideal for team building activity to allow others to understand struggles others may face” and that they **“enjoyed the idea that the newspaper puppet can represent 'how I feel in the world' not just physical disability”** \(E5\). 

 The workshop sparked ideas surrounding diverse identities, acceptance and how self\-identity and identity formation can be explored and expressed using puppetry: “Acceptance of 'spontaneous' diversity; anybody has his/her own abilities/challenges; much more interesting than starting by brain concepts. The readymade puppet creates his/her own identity”. One participant shared that **“The paper puppet works well for identification with my ‘disabled’ body”** \(E5\). Participants also expressed a new or expanded understanding of what puppetry is able to achieve both as an art form and in applied/ therapeutic settings, stating that “This workshop gave me a lovely insight into how collaborative improvisation, movement, intention, gesture and imagination bring the puppet and story to life more than ‘correct’, ‘normal’ form” \(E5\). Another participant highlighted the importance of the workshop: 

 Very relevant as I work through metaphor and I use puppets/handmade puppets to allow clients to find their ‘authentic self' \(E5\)

###  2. Underpinning research 

 World\-wide, humans have so far produced over 6 billion tonnes of plastic waste, with only 9% of this recycled, often into low\-value products. Since 2007, Prof Iza Radecka has led a team at the University of Wolverhampton, with the mission of investigating alternative plastic and biopolymer products. The team has helped to drive forward the agenda around environmentally friendly solutions, including biodegradable plastics and utilisation of post\-customer plastic wastes. The research has yielded the following findings: 

 <ins>F1. Converting industrial waste into polymeric materials</ins> 

 The use of waste oil and waste plastic as carbon sources for the production of added\-value products is a great opportunity for reducing the environmental impact of non\-biodegradable plastic wastes. Our multidisciplinary collaborative research in bioremediation and applied chemistry has developed a viable integrated biotechnological/chemical process allowing us to transform waste biorefinery by\-products into value\-added biodegradable, non\-toxic natural bioplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoate \(PHA\) \[R1 & R2\]. This process not only leads to environmental benefits, but can also reduce the production costs of PHAs. Biodegradable polymers can be used in the areas of agriculture, cosmetics, medicine and compostable plastic packaging \[R1 & R2\]. 

 <ins>F2. Improvement of biodegradable oligomers</ins> 

 We recently developed a combined extraction\-chemical transformation approach of PHA\-containing biomass using non\-chlorinated solvents or ionic liquid media. In this method, the PHA in the cells is extracted into an ionic liquid medium, and simultaneously undergoes a \(trans\)esterification reaction with the bioactive compound containing either carboxyl or hydroxyl functionality in the medium to form bioactive conjugates \[R3\]. The work focused on the herbicide oligomers, and demonstrated its efficacy to suppress broadleaf weed growth without significant phytotoxicity to crop species, the results of which are important for commercial use in high\-value crop systems \[R4\]. 

 <ins>F3. Development of  biodegradable cosmetic packaging</ins> 

 The use of biobased plastics is of great importance for many applications. An interesting alternative to conventional plastic packaging for cosmetics would be the use of biodegradable polymers. Blending biodegradable thermoplastic polylactide \(PLA\) with polyhydroxyalkanoate \(PHA\) enables the formulation of mechanically superior materials with good biodegradation properties.  PLA and PHA are already used for traditional extrusion processes, but now can also be used in the three\-dimensional \(3D\) printing process. Therefore \(bio\)degradable polymers open up new possibilities for 3D technology \[R5\]. Our research in the area of biodegradable polymers can provide new opportunities for the packaging industry. 

 <ins>F4. Sustainable cleaning systems</ins> 

 Microorganisms are often used within biofilters to facilitate rapid bioremediation of chemical waste. Results from research conducted using immobilised cells have demonstrated that these microorganisms can be trapped within a 3D polymer matrix \[R6\]. The structure of the filter helps to tailor the rate of biodegradation of pollutants by serving as a protective layer limiting exposure of the microorganisms to toxic external conditions, at the same time enhancing bioremediation \[R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>I1. Impacts on public policy</ins> 

 Based on our extensive research into biodegradable polymers and the obtained knowledge of the relationship between structure, properties and function of advanced biodegradable polymeric materials, our research team has been able to produce examples of environmentally degradable packages. This has enabled us to establish a National Information Point \(NIP UK\) for sustainable plastics in the UK \( [https://sites.google.com/site/plasticeuk/about\-the\-nip](https://sites.google.com/site/plasticeuk/about-the-nip)\), with the aim of informing the public about biodegradable plastic standards. Following this, in July 2014, we were invited to become a member of the stakeholder advisory group \(Carrier Bags Team\) at the Department of Farming and Rural Affairs \(DEFRA\) on the development of biodegradable plastic bag standards, and an exemption from the 5p \(GBP0.5\) charge for single use carrier bags \[C1\]. We were involved in discussions around the criteria for inclusion within a standard, the cost implications, test methods as well as technologies and innovation within the sector. The Senior Executive Officer for Environment Quality said “Professor Radecka played a key role in this group and her work contributed to a report on biodegradable bags” \[C2\]. The Secretary of State presented the report in Parliament on the 17<sup>th</sup> December 2015 \[C3\]. The urgent need for development of new biodegradability standards for biodegradable bags has been identified in order to give consumers and the recycling industry confidence that things labelled as biodegradable, really are. 

 <ins>I2. Innovation in new environmentally friendly products</ins> 

 <ins>Prima Makeup Ltd</ins> 

 The knowledge and skills in the area of biodegradable polymers \[F3\] have successfully been shared with the cruelty\-free cosmetic SME “Prima Makeup Ltd” via participation in the “Environmental Technologies & Resources Efficiency Support Service” ERDF project EnTRESS which supports the adoption of technologies and processes for the reuse, recycling and recovery of materials and resources \[G3\]. Prima Makeup sells cosmetics in over 19 countries and through high street partners. After discussion with the company, in 2018 we helped them with 2 products \[C4\]: completely biodegradable glitter, and a biodegradable packaging solution for their cosmetics \[C4\]. We suggested which biodegradable polymers would be suitable for their glitter as well as pots/jars for their products. Without our recommendations, their cosmetics would have been marketed in plastic pots or a glass jars. The additional 3D design / prototype helped the company to secure orders and get both cosmetics and packaging into production. Subsequently, following the work with the University of Wolverhampton, Prima Makeup was awarded both “Best Start\-up” and “Business of the Year” in the Black Country Chamber of Commerce Awards. 

 <ins>Rozone Ltd</ins> 

 Using the group’s understanding of bioremediation \[F1\] and biofilters \[F4\] a project was undertaken between 2017 and 2019 with the commercial cleaning company Rozone, specialising in environmentally friendly cleaning technologies. The overall aim of the project was for the company to enhance the viability of its existing products by developing a new range of innovative products around the principles of ‘low environmental impact cleaning’ and to develop the company’s own USPs \(unique selling points\) and IP \(intellectual property\) within this field. Thanks to the research input from the University of Wolverhampton on the creation of environmentally friendly biofilters using solvent\-free technology, Rozone were able to develop their own unique environmentally friendly parts washer, the ROwasher cleaning system. 

 On their website, Rozone highlights a number of successful case studies of various organisations using the ROwasher. A representative from 1 of Britain’s leading power utility companies referred to the ROwasher as having “brought parts back to life” \[C5\]. An automative and commercial vehicle company highlighted that the ROwasher “produced powerful cleaning results”, managing to remove carbon deposits usually reserved for the likes of aggressive solvent cleaners \[C6\]. Rozone is highly satisfied with the outcomes of the project in terms of the excellent environmentally friendly product they were able to create, but also in terms of the financial benefit \[C7\]. Rozone indicated that the “health and safety consideration and compliance on the ROwasher were the strongest in the bioremediating parts washer sector” \[C7\]. They indicated that up to 31<sup>st</sup> December 2020 they had sold 247 units of the ROwasher, with a turnover of over GBP206,483. Aside from the ROwasher, the expertise provided to the company by the University of Wolverhampton has also allowed them to design their own suite of cleaning solutions, which were previously purchased under licence from the USA. This has saved the company approximately GBP290,000 up until the end of 2020 \[C7\]. Through benefiting Rozone financially, and through the subsequent environmental benefits derived from their customers’ usage of the Rowasher, this project has been an immense success. 

 <ins>I3. Improving public understanding of biodegradable products</ins> 

 The originality of our work and its contribution to the knowledge in the area of biodegradable polymers have been effectively disseminated to the scientific community and general public \[F1, F2\], mainly since 2017. TV and radio appearances have included: BBC Radio 4’s ‘Burn That Fat\!’; CBC Radio Canada’s ‘Quirks & Quarks’; BBC Midland’s Today; and ABC Brisbane, Australia \[C8\]. Other news appearances include 2 Guardian articles, a New Scientist article, and 2 BBC News website articles \[C8\]. In total, along with a number of other media appearances and social media attention, the potential audience has been in the many millions. Public online comments on the Guardian article, “The plastics problem – are natural alternatives doing more harm than good?” suggest the news attention inspires debate around the topic of plastic waste and recycling. 

 Following these media appearances, in March 2018 we were invited to take part in the first of a new series of events entitled 'Reinventing' hosted by the Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy at Chatham House, London. This event explored new designs, technologies, products and practical solutions that could better meet future social and environmental needs in relation to plastic wastes, and was attended by a number of industry professionals and policy makers \[C9\]. 

 Overall our research so far, has had substantial impacts on a range of sustainability issues around plastic waste and other key environmental problems. In the future, such technologies will become vital tools in our battle against environmentally costly and unsustainable manufacturing practices.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research on Anthony Burgess by Professor Andrew Biswell and Dr Paul Wake has created new worldwide audiences for the novelist’s publications, making them available in countries where they had been censored, with translations into Maltese, Chinese, Malay, Turkish and Romanian appearing for the first time. Biswell is the Director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation, which has revived and significantly broadened the cultural appeal of the writer’s legacy among twenty\-first\-century audiences and artists extending public and creative engagement well beyond *A Clockwork Orange* \(1962\) *.* The research has stimulated the proliferation of new cultural productions across various genres and media, including theatrical performances, films, music and public artworks. As a result of this work by Biswell and Wake, the annual royalty income of the Burgess Estate rose by over 70%, from GBP149,970 \(2014\) to GBP255,585 \(2018\) with new works, broadcasts and events reaching a global audience of over 980,000. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Biswell’s and Wake’s research is centred on the Burgess archives and an ambitious editorial project supported by a university press, and underpinned by three interconnected aims: discovery, dissemination and innovation. A long\-term commitment to these goals was confirmed by the secondment of Biswell, who remains a full Professor at the university, to the Directorship of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation in 2010. 

 Biswell’s *The Real Life of Anthony Burgess* \(2005\) has influenced and enlivened public perception of the writer’s legacy well beyond the academy. Based on extensive archival research and more than 200 interviews with Burgess’s friends, editors and peers, this biography traced the trajectory of Burgess’s life for the first time and revealed a fully rounded portrait of a notoriously self\-concealing writer. It sold more than 6,000 copies and received widespread critical acclaim: it was named as a *Guardian* Book of the Year in 2005 and was awarded the Portico Prize for North\-West Book of the Year in 2006 **\[1\]**. *A Clockwork Orange: The Restored Edition* \(2012\) was equally ground\-breaking in revisiting Burgess’s iconic novel. Celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of its first publication, Biswell’s newly edited text includes an introduction, explanatory notes, an expanded Nadsat glossary and critical essays. The introduction demonstrates the depth of Burgess’s knowledge of dystopian literature and positions him as a linguistic pioneer within the genre. Biswell’s annotations illustrate previously overlooked aspects of the text, such as the creative misquotations from Shakespeare and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Penguin has sold more than 61,000 copies in paperback since December 2013 **\[2\].** 

 Conceived, guided and co\-ordinated by Biswell and Wake, the Irwell Edition of the Works of Anthony Burgess \(2017–\) is an ongoing project, published by Manchester University Press. This first scholarly edition of Burgess’s novels and non\-fiction \(including stage plays, film scripts, letters, audio\-visual archives and notebooks\) aims to restore ‘lost’ writing to the canon of the writer’s already available works. Drawing on original research in diasporic archives located in Manchester, Austin \(Texas\), Angers \(France\), Hamilton \(Ontario\) and Caen \(Normandy\), the edition establishes Burgess’s significance within the twentieth\-century canon by relating his work to that of other prominent literary figures, such as Shakespeare, Hopkins, James Joyce, John Keats and J. G. Ballard, as well as artistic media \(music halls, silent cinemas and photography\). The Irwell Edition has also crystallised and reinforced the author’s cultural significance for Manchester—his place of birth—by including novels set in the city, such as *A Vision of Battlements* \(1965\) and *The Pianoplayers* \(1986\), and incorporating appendices that demonstrate and document the writer’s rootedness in the city. Bringing together a panel of international experts, the edition targets a global readership by purposefully reconfiguring Burgess as a cosmopolitan writer whose creative vision encompassed places such as Gibraltar \( *A Vision of Battlements*, edited by Biswell in 2017\) **\[3\]**, New York \( *Puma*, edited by Wake in 2018\) **\[4\]** and Italy \( *ABBA ABBA*, 2019\). Other volumes in the Irwell Edition, such as *The Pianoplayers* \(2017\) and *This Man and Music* \(2020\), focus attention on Burgess as a musician **\[5\]**. 

 *Obscenity and the Arts* \(2018\), a cross\-disciplinary collaboration with the graphic designer Adam Griffiths and feminist critic Germaine Greer, provides an innovative examination of Burgess’s writing and lecturing on literary censorship. Edited and introduced by Biswell, the volume explores Burgess’s struggle with censorship in Malta between 1968 and 1974. It is presented as a montage of biographical narrative, lecture text, feminist response, documentary photography and new artwork, and constitutes a valuable excavation of a little\-known period in Burgess’s life **\[6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The International Anthony Burgess Foundation \(IABF\) has generated significant economic impact and subsequent investment in the arts. The IABF has also curated new national and international cultural production, reinvigorated the celebration, commemoration and critical reappraisal of Burgess’s legacy across diverse audiences, platforms and locales, and contributed to our understanding of literature’s impact on national and local identity. 

 **Economic impact and investment in the arts** 

 As a result of the publications produced by Biswell and Wake, including translations, the annual royalty income of the Burgess Estate rose by over 70%, from GBP149,970 \(2014\) to GBP255,585 \(2018\). The success of this publishing strategy is evidenced by the fact that new editions of Burgess’s work have led to sales of 301,628 since 2014, including translations of Biswell’s 2012 edition of *A Clockwork Orange* **\[A\]**. In addition to generating significant income, this work has made an outstanding contribution to the cultural ecology of the city and the region. 

 Seconded to the IABF as director and CEO since July 2010, Biswell has established it as one of the premier live literature venues in Manchester, hosting more than 200 cultural events in 2019 alone. Under Biswell's artistic direction, the Burgess Foundation presents an illustrious series of book launches and literature readings, concerts, film screenings, archive tours and public exhibitions. Attendance at these events is consistently strong, with estimated audiences of more than 35,000 at the venue from 2013 to 2019. The IABF’s long\-standing partnerships with the *Observer* newspaper and the *Guardian* Media Group provide opportunities for new and emerging writers associated with the IABF to be published and mentored by industry professionals. The Foundation carries out partnership events with external organisations such as the National Portrait Gallery, the Edinburgh International Book Festival, Random House, Carcanet Press, Comma, Faber and Faber, Penguin Classics, Manchester Central Library, Chetham’s Library, Kino Film Festival, the Manchester Comedy Festival and the Manchester Science Festival. Since 2011, the Foundation has been the main hub venue for the annual Manchester Literature Festival **\[A\]**. 

 The growing interest in Burgess among non\-academic audiences is evidenced by the decision of BBC Radio 3 to feature his work in a series of broadcasts since 2012. In 2017 Biswell was the consultant for five BBC radio essays, curating talks on morality, colonialism, class, criticism and language. Biswell also advised on the first radio production of *Oedipus the King* \(1972\), translated and adapted by Burgess. Listener numbers evidence the success of these broadcasts: the former attracted 49,000 listeners per programme \(245,000 listeners in total\); the latter attracted 76,000 listeners **\[A\]**. The current reappraisal of Burgess’s cultural legacy is most clearly demonstrated by the new appreciation of his work as a musician. Radio 3 broadcasts include a two\-hour edition of *Saturday Classics* \(2017\), written and presented by Biswell, which examined musical influences on Burgess \(with an audience of 145,000\), and an adaptation of *A Clockwork Orange* \(2017\), which featured music composed by Burgess and re\-scored for the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra. The latter was recorded before a live audience of 406 at the Middleton Hall in Hull and the broadcast reached an audience of 70,000 listeners. On 22/3/20, the BBC broadcast Burgess’s ‘lost’ play *Schreber*, featuring Christopher Eccleston. Biswell discovered this unpublished play, based on one of Freud’s case histories, in the IABF archives. The radio drama was selected by the *Observer* as one of its cultural highlights of the week **\[A\]**. Following the Coronavirus lockdown in March 2020, new online exhibitions curated by the IABF have included ‘Portraits of Anthony Burgess’, ‘Burgess on Tape’, ‘The Music of Anthony Burgess’, ‘Banned Books’ and ‘Burgess and the Atomic Age’. Collectively, these online exhibitions have received 15,220 hits, demonstrating the popularity and importance of the Burgess Foundation’s digital presence **\[A\]**. 

 **New cultural production** 

 Biswell’s and Wake’s work has directly stimulated new cultural production incorporating writing, film, music, theatre and visual art. In 2017, the Manchester International Festival commissioned *No End to Enderby*, a pair of artists’ films by Stephen Sutcliffe and Graham Eatough, adapted from two novels by Burgess. The artists explained how Biswell’s research had been influential in creating the films: ‘ *The Real Life of Anthony Burgess* was a primary reference point for us in creating *No End to Enderby* \[…\] It provided an invaluable background to Burgess’s life from which we were able to create our central characters \[… \] Throughout the pre\- and post\-production of our films we consulted with Andrew to support our ideas and creative process, and in order to have access to a wider context to our understanding of Burgess and his works. These conversations formed an important part of our application to the Contemporary Arts Society’s annual award in association with the Whitworth Gallery, which we won in 2015’. These films received the GBP40,000 Contemporary Art Society Award and were exhibited at the Whitworth Art Gallery \(2017\) and the Glasgow International Festival \(2018\), where they attracted 95,195 visitors. Biswell participated in public discussions with the artists as part of the Manchester and Glasgow festival programmes and contributed an introduction to an illustrated book of storyboards, based on the two films, published by Lux in 2020 and marketed to visual artists and curators **\[B\].** 

 In the same year, the IABF and the Manchester International Festival jointly commissioned Raymond Yiu to compose *The World Was Once All Miracle*, a song\-cycle based on six Burgess poems. The inaugural performance by the BBC Philharmonic at the Bridgewater Hall attracted a live audience of 2,341, in addition to a worldwide Radio 3 audience of approximately 169,000; a second performance at the Barbican Hall in London generated audience numbers of 1,943 \(live audience\) and approximately 108,000 \(Radio 3 audience\). Yiu commented that ‘\[the\] International Anthony Burgess Foundation has played a vital part in the becoming of the composition… they gave me informed and enlightening guidance in navigating the labyrinth of materials – both in\-house as well as from other Burgess archives in other parts of the world – in order to choose the most suitable ones for my composition. Without their help, it would have been otherwise an extremely daunting task’ **\[C\]**. 

 Further evidence of encouraging new cultural production is provided by the writer Adam Roberts, who in 2018 collaborated with Biswell to produce a new novel, *The Black Prince*, based on an unpublished Burgess film script. Roberts writes: ‘I re\-read Biswell’s *The Real Life of Anthony Burgess*, by way of positioning myself with respect to a “Burgess”\-y creative praxis: not just producing pastiche, but trying to understand what Burgess was trying to do, mimicking his methods of writing \[…\] Prof. Biswell was supportive and helpful, read the first draft of the completed novel and assisted in several ways with the publication process. After publication he staged a public conversation in Manchester at which he and I discussed Burgess as a novelist and talked about the new novel’ **\[D\]**. 

 In 2018, the Liverpool Everyman Theatre presented a stage adaptation of *A Clockwork Orange*. The production showcased a new score by Burgess that had been discovered by Biswell in the IABF archive. Many of the audience \(4,560 over 21 performances\) were young people who had never previously visited the theatre **\[E\]**. In November 2019, The Burgess Foundation hosted ‘Conversations with the Anthony Burgess Cassette Archive’, a performance of new experimental sound art, created in response to materials assembled by Biswell from the Burgess audio archive. Participants explained how the archive had shaped their compositions in a series of publicly available podcasts. Contributing artist Robin Rimbaud, aka Scanner, discussed how the project brought together his interest in analogue technology, hauntology, archives and experimental performance. Dr Alan Dunn, the curator of the project, spoke about the significance of bringing archives into connection with creative practice, thereby ‘keeping them contemporary, getting artists to re\-work them, \[and\] find nuances that perhaps a historian or archivist might not recognise’ **\[F\].** 

 **National and local identity** 

 At a national level, the contemporary reappraisal of Burgess’s reputation in response to the work of the IABF is underlined by the presence of *A Clockwork Orange* on the OCR A\-level syllabus of texts recommended for Comparative and Contextual Study since 2017. This indicates the extent to which Burgess’s writing has become part of the urgent ongoing debate about how the twentieth\-century canon should be configured for contemporary readers of school and college age. In 2020, demonstrating the increased national interest in Burgess’s legacy, Biswell was asked to contribute to the submission for a Blue Plaque installation at Burgess’s 1960s residence in Chiswick **\[G\].** 

 At a local level, the work of Biswell and Wake has significantly raised the profile of Burgess within Manchester. Margaret Drabble, delivering the 2019 Anthony Burgess Lecture, commented that: ‘After a bohemian and adventurous life, much of which was spent abroad, Burgess has been claimed by his own city, Manchester’ **\[H\]**. A mural of Burgess in the city, created by the street artist Tankpetrol in Manchester’s Northern Quarter for the 2016 Cities of Hope Festival, is now a local landmark. Google searching for website and blog responses to this mural alone brings up 429 national and international hits. This public artwork demonstrates both the Burgess Foundation’s impact on the emerging stature of Burgess in the city of his birth, and the ways in which his reinvigorated reputation continues to provoke new creative work from a variety of contemporary artists **\[I\].** 

 **Increased international audiences and reputation** 

 Burgess’s reputation as an international figure has been greatly enhanced by Biswell’s and Wake’s work. During the period of evaluation, articles on Burgess appeared in at least 33 countries, reaching an estimated circulation of over 1,600,000 million **\[J\]**. *Obscenity and the Arts,* published in 2018, examines the question of Burgess’s reputation in Malta, where his books were banned and 50 titles from his private library confiscated by the authorities. The publication of this book has led directly to a new focus on Burgess in the Maltese media, and the first Maltese theatre production of *A Clockwork Orange*, which was staged in November 2019. Reviewing this production, which was aimed at school\-age audiences aged 14\+, the *Times of Malta* wrote: ‘ *Larinġa Mekkanika* was a fast\-paced, intense adaptation which was faithful to Burgess’s vision and final message \[…\] It also facilitates the necessary understanding that free will is an essential aspect of our very flawed, but very genuine, humanity’ **\[K\]**. The repercussions of the IABF’s international reach are demonstrated by the writer’s prominence in Manchester’s successful bid to become a UNESCO City of Literature in 2018. The UNESCO City of Literature website emphasises the significance of Burgess and his legacy to the city of Manchester **\[L\].**

1.  **Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Applied research by Steed at Gray’s School of Art, Robert Gordon University supported an SME in NE Scotland in embedding design competencies through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(KTP\). The KTP resulted in the embedding of design\-led innovation processes that played a pivotal role in the strategic repositioning of the company’s sub\-brands and brought cultural change within the organization. Significant impacts also include the development of a strategic plan for the company with new processes implemented with increased efficiency and quality control, employment of new staff, and creation of a new product range with a sustainability agenda. 
","
1.  **Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Steed’s research applied a new model of collaboration using an inclusive, iterative and objectives\-driven, performance\-based approach focusing on the role of design as a management tool within a traditional textile company. The project demonstrated the impact of creative design and design management tools in the exchange of knowledge and new product development, and transformed the company’s understanding of the value of design towards their economic growth. 

 Previously the business had built a strong client base through their reputation to deliver functional and hard\-wearing products quickly to the Oil & Gas sector. As this sector retracted as a result of the O&G crisis of 2015, the company did not have the internal innovation competencies required to explore new markets within the design sector. This study identified alternative business operations integrating design methods to explore new markets within the fashion sector. This was achieved through a product situational review including both internal and external analysis of their current processes and existing methodologies/technologies towards new markets. As part of this audit, a number of internal consultations with staff were undertaken to understand the perceived challenges. 

 The project emcompassed a review of the company’s product portfolio, in conjunction with the mapping of its manufacturing process and a desktop analysis on competitors’ activities, customer segments/market opportunities, design technologies and methodologies and market trends. In parallel with this analysis, discussions were held with competitors and potential customers, as well as a consultation with external agencies. All findings were reported to management and the new situational environment embedded within the company was communicated via regular reporting/presentations to company staff.  This allowed the implementation of inclusive design\-led initiatives internally by engaging employees as stakeholders in the repositioning strategy. A review of quality control systems revealed that the business needed to make significant improvements in their manufacturing standards to meet the requirements of premium markets. These improvements were successfully achieved through the formation of an internal working innovation group, employment of new staff experienced in quality manufacture, together with a training programme for staff and the employment of an apprentice machinist. In addition, a dedicated manufacturing area for the new product range was created, and the creation of a design studio as a bridge between design with manufacture was achieved, where creative design and management tools were embedded within the company. 

 New business\-to\-business collaboration with Halley Stevensons, a world leading manufacturer in waxed cotton and weatherproofed fabrics, resulted in prototypes exhibited as part of their stand at the international fabric fair ‘Premiere Vision’ to test the potential market. Product diversification towards the fashion market was further recommended through an external business management consultancy who facilitated an internal workshop with staff to develop the communication and marketing strategy for the new product range to the premium fashion market. 

 The project produced three peer\-reviewed journal papers <sup> **R1,R2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>R3</sup>** and conference articles, two under\-graduate and one post\-graduate student industry projects, four invited presentations and showcase events, and received an outstanding grade A assessment award by Innovate UK.

 **Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Embedding design competencies within Montrose Rope & Sail Company Limited has enabled company stakeholders to take control of their brand and design direction towards new premium markets. In a design capacity, the company is now in a position to invest and develop their research, design and brand strategy. This project has enabled the company to actively seek high profile collaborations with fashion brands to develop their positioning within the fashion market, both B2B and B2C. This will support their 10\-year strategy which aims to be recognised in other global markets outwith the O&G sector <sup> **C1**</sup>. 

 **IMPACT 1 –** The project introduced new quality standards and operations that met the demands of premium markets. By its conclusion, new quality assurance and control systems were fully implemented enabling consistency in product quality and bolstering the company’s confidence in their ability to compete in high\-end niche markets<sup> **C2</sup>.** 

 **IMPACT 2 \-** The research transformed how the business identified new markets through the development of a business development strategy which enabled it to diversify and de\-risk its reliance on one market<sup> **C3**</sup>. According to Lynda Paton, Montrose Rope & Sail Company Manager and KTP Company Supervisor, “The KTP has impacted on the whole company structure where through the embedding of design\-led innovation processes has brought about a strategic re\-positioning of all sub\-brands under the core company. Having an Associate as design ambassador has brought significant cultural change within the company where they have acted as the conduit to embed a company\-wide approach to design. The project has initiated the implementation of a design strategy at all levels across the whole company and we are now able to invest internally and externally in design to develop the company strategy. We are now able to continue our work on a transformational repositioning of the company brand<sup> **C2**</sup>.” 

 **IMPACT 3 –** The project collaborated with Halley Stevensons, leading textile manufacturer and main supplier to international outdoor fashion brand Barbour. This collaboration has supported access to new markets as initial prototypes were displayed at the textile manufacturer’s stand at the international fabric fair in Paris \- Premiere Vision \(September 2018\)<sup> **C2**</sup>. 

 **IMPACT 4 \-**  The employment of four new members of staff to the company, one of which included the Associate to a full\-time post as Design & Brand Development manager post\-KTP. This is a 20% increase in the company’s workforce<sup> **C2**</sup>. 

 **IMPACT 5 \-**  The Associate’s appointment to the senior management team as Design and Brand Development Manager illustrates the value of the underpinning research brought to the business over the course of the KTP endorsed by Lynda Paton, Montrose Rope & Sail, Company Manager and KTP Company Supervisor <sup> **C1**</sup>. “Moving into the fashion sector has required a systematic change for the company and our existing culture where the Associate will continue to work closely with staff as part of her new position post KTP to ensure the adoption of change within the business and will oversee and facilitate the embedding of all step changes required in manufacturing to produce high end products<sup> **C2**</sup>.” The embedding of a design graduate within the business has led to a greater focus on design\-led innovation and quality assurance, thus transforming the working practice at the company <sup> **C1**</sup>. 

 **IMPACT 6 \-**  While the economic impacts of the KTP are still to be fully realized due to COVID\-19,   by 2023 the company’s financial projections in net profits from the new range in annual sales turnover is expected to be £428,055 <sup> **C1,</sup><sup>C2**</sup>. 

 **IMPACT 7 \-** The project focused on supporting Montrose Rope & Sail becoming a globally recognised brand in the fashion sector. Through discussions with its Scottish Enterprise Client Manager, an opportunity was identified to attend a workshop run by Scotland Development International \(SDI\) towards a growth plan for the new range. A meeting with SDI’s Japanese Market specialist led to SDI supporting the company to expand into international markets. This is a direct result of this project. The company have been invited by SDI to participate in their virtual trade mission to Japan and Physical Showcase at Project Tokyo, 10 & 11 March 2021  [https://www.project\-tokyo.com/](https://www.project-tokyo.com/) <sup> **C1**</sup>. 

 **IMPACT 8 \-**  The KTP was awarded Grade A \(Outstanding\) by the funding body Innovate UK<sup> **C3</sup>** and has also led to a further KTP project with Harris Tweed Hebrides with AHRC support. The findings of the KTP were presented to the Senior Investment Manager at the AHRC on his visit to RGU, which later led to a further KTP with Harris Tweed Hebrides, starting in the first quarter of  2021<sup> **C2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>C4</sup>.**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Ramirez’s research has integrated Scenario Planning \(SP\) with other scholarly fields such as Social Ecology, Sensemaking, and Design to develop the Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\). The OSPA is a distinctive SP methodology that has been influential worldwide across organisations and industry sectors by enabling a shift in the mind\-set of strategic management from closed to more open and flexible. Approximately 1,000 individuals from several hundred organisations have benefitted from instruction on the methodology to date via the Oxford Scenarios Programme \(OSP\) at the Saïd Business School. The OSPA has served as the catalyst for changes in strategic planning at companies such as Rolls Royce, and influenced policy and funding decisions within public bodies such as the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the World Economic Forum \(WEF\), the International Atomic Energy Authority \(IAEA\), and the National Health Service \(NHS\), charities such as Diabetes UK and Mercy Corps, and even scientific fields such as gastroenterology and the chemical sciences.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Action research conducted by Ramirez and colleagues since 2005 with participants at the Oxford Futures Forum \(OFF\) – a triennial meeting of scholars and practitioners exploring new research collaborations focused on Scenario Planning \(SP\) – has informed the concepts of the Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\). The OSPA is a distinctive SP methodology that contributes to strategic management through an iterative process of framing, reframing, and reperception. This enables an important shift in mind\-set, whose effectiveness lies not in terms of old to new, or wrong to right, but from closed to open and flexible. This is the central value proposition of the OSPA **\[R1\]**. Ramirez developed the methodology with Wilkinson \(Associate Fellow, Saïd Business School \(SBS\); CEO & Secretary General, World Energy Council\), and Van der Heijden \(formerly Associate Fellow, Templeton College; Emeritus Professor, University of Strathclyde\). Ramirez and Wilkinson contributed jointly to the ideas in **R1**, with Ramirez providing 3 of the 6 case studies in which the methodology is grounded, working together with Wilkinson on a fourth. 

 Research with OFF participants has enabled 2 common divides to be addressed in the OSPA’s pedagogy – that between theory and practice, and between SP and other scholarly fields. In **R2** for example, Ramirez collaborated with Churchhouse \(then Director of Digital, Rolls\-Royce plc\), Palermo \(Manager of External Relations, Royal Society of Chemistry\), and Hoffman \(Associate Professor, Skema Business School\) to show how his co\-authors’ organisations had deployed the OSPA in their strategic management. The research has also integrated SP with other scholarly fields such as Social Ecology, Sensemaking, and Design to inform the ontological, epistemological, and methodological foundations of the OSPA, making it distinctive from other plausibility\-based SP approaches in 3 ways: 

 *1\) The OSPA is learner\-centric in terms of its methodological choices.* This reflects its core theoretical roots in social ecology. In **R3**, Ramirez and co\-author Selsky \(Consulting Fellow, Institute for Washington’s Future\) contrast conventional strategic approaches derived from neoclassical economics with a socio\-ecological approach to strategy. They propose that the latter approach better helps strategic planners to engage the unpredictable uncertainty that characterises turbulent environments. Consequently, the OSPA articulates a phenomenological approach to strategy and not a predict\-and\-control mode. Focusing on usefulness makes determining purpose and user a primary condition to establishing success – which differs from considering success on whether the scenarios unfold as imagined. This is taken to be impossible in the turbulent, uncertain, novel, and ambiguous \(TUNA\) conditions in which SP is used. Ramirez and Selsky worked jointly on the manuscript for **R3**, bringing specialist knowledge on SP and Social Ecology to the collaboration, respectively. 

 *2\) The OSPA is designed to produce iterative learning through cycles of reframing and re\-perception.* Reframing occurs at a higher logical order through a process of ‘upframing’, which invites the scenario learners to view their situation from a ‘macro’ viewpoint, situated in the future that encompasses the wider context. A complementary ‘downframing’ process then helps the scenario learners to immerse themselves in the new contexts they learn. In downframing, the learners experience the ‘micro’ specific ‘what if’ implications for practice **\[R1, R2\]**. In **R4**, Ramirez presents the theory and provides empirical support using 2 case studies developed with Mukherjee \(Associate Fellow, Oxford Institute of Retail Management \(OxIRM\), SBS; Lecturer, James Cook University\) and Cuthbertson \(Senior Research Fellow and Director of OxIRM, SBS\). Ramirez was the lead author and provided the overall argument and theoretical lens, with Mukherjee and Cuthbertson providing data and leading on the analysis. 

 Ramirez’s research with Selin \(Associate Fellow, SBS; Associate Professor, School of Sustainability, College of Global Futures, Arizona State University\) underlines the central role of plausibility as it guides and helps assess development of a limited number of contrasting, relevant, and challenging scenarios as part of the above process of upframing. Their joint research found plausibility plays a more significant role than probability in many cognitive processes of deliberation and decision\-making. Plausibility is preferable to probability in TUNA conditions, where probability is either irrelevant or a logical impossibility **\[R5\]**. Ramirez was the lead author on **R5**, with Selin contributing insights on plausibility. 

 Ramirez and Eidinow \(Chair in Ancient History, University of Bristol\) are the only authors in the field who have proposed the aesthetics of storytelling as a technology to create and share plausibility to analyse scenario stories in SP **\[R6\]**. The role of aesthetics in articulating plausibility is one of the distinguishing features of the OSPA. Both authors contributed equally to **R6**, with Ramirez providing insights on SP and Eidinow the classical view on aesthetics. 

 *3\) The OSPA is designed to help strategists and policymakers find more and better options for coping and succeeding in TUNA conditions.* In TUNA conditions, applicability of existing factual evidence to forecast is limited. SP complements and challenges existing strategy development, but it is not the same as strategy. The research underpinning the OSPA examines the wider context that strategy inhabits, independent of the will or control of the strategist, recognising the need for a balance of competitive and collaborative strategic action in TUNA conditions **\[R1\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The Oxford Scenario Planning Approach \(OSPA\) has raised the quality of strategic conversations and led to invention and testing of new options and actions in multiple industries and sectors worldwide, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, energy, security law enforcement, and charities. Approximately 1,000 individuals from several hundred organisations have been through the Oxford Scenarios Programme \(OSP\) to date. The OSP is Saïd Business School’s executive development programme founded on the methodology. Alumnae have deployed the OSPA to the benefit of firms such as Rolls\-Royce, Anglo\-American, and Wärtsilä; intergovernmental organisations such as the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\), the European Patent Office \(EPO\), and the International Atomic Energy Agency \(IAEA\); NGOs and charities such as the World Economic Forum \(WEF\), Diabetes UK, and Mercy Corps; and scientific and professional fields such as Royal Society of Chemistry \(RSC\), BMJ, and United European Gastroenterology. As illustrative examples, participants on the OSP have collaborated with Ramirez on joint scholarly publications that explore the ways in which the OSPA has been employed in their institutions. One such example is Rolls\-Royce **\[R2\]**. 

###  Changes in strategic planning at Rolls\-Royce 

 After issuing 4 profit warnings and witnessing a share price fall of over 50%, in 2016 the OSPA helped Rolls\-Royce develop a new strategic planning process that re\-orientated the company’s investment process. Several dozen top managers had participated in an OSPA\-centred programme the previous summer. This led to an appetite for a company\-wide scenario planning process. 25 mid\-and\-senior level executives selected from different business units, functions, and locations, attended a 3\-day OSP workshop, during which they developed a set of scenarios addressing core strategic questions. According to Rolls\-Royce’s VP Strategy: *‘These are now used…as a stress test of the resilience of the group and business strategic plans carried out at least annually, and also as one of the decision criteria for each strategic investment option being considered. It is acknowledged within the company that the use of scenario planning contributed to the acceleration of some key strategic investments for the company which otherwise may have been delayed until a future time.’* **\[E1\]** 

 According to the VP Strategy, the introduction of the OSPA as a tool to stress\-test the group and business unit strategic plans also yielded several ‘soft’ benefits, including: *‘an “unfreezing” of the senior executives’ thought patterns to become more aware and creative; a mechanism to “make sense” of contextual complexities and uncertainties; a structured thinking approach for considering alternative plausible futures \(even if not probable\);* \[and\] *an ability to collaborate in the wider industrial strategic arenas where scenario planning is more mature/developing.’* **\[E1\]** 

###  Incorporating longer\-term risks and uncertainties into the International Monetary Fund’s \(IMF’s\) analysis 

 The OSPA has supported the IMF’s mission across its 3 major business lines of economic surveillance, lending, and capacity development. According to the IMF’s Director of Strategy, the IMF consulted Ramirez on *‘how to incorporate longer\-term risks and uncertainties into* \[its\] *traditionally shorter\-term analysis.’* **\[E2\]** This led to 2 rounds of scenario planning: the first in 2012, the second in 2016. ‘Prof Ramirez’s research, including his book* **\[R1\]** *…served as important references for guiding scenario planning at the IMF. We have used recent research articles to motivate users* **\[R2\]** *, inform scenario design questions, and tailor scenario planning to users more accustomed to working with probability\-related concepts* **\[R5\]** *.’* **\[E2\]** 

 An ongoing review of the IMF’s economic surveillance activities uses custom\-built OSPA scenarios to identify work priorities that are robust in an uncertain future and will influence how the IMF allocates resources across its 189 member countries. The Director of Strategy confirms: *‘Our Fall 2018 Regional Economic Outlook for sub\-Saharan Africa* **\[E3\]** *used scenario planning – rooted in Prof Ramirez’s research – to call for an adaption of development strategies to demographic, climatic, and technological change.’* **\[E2\]** 

 In response to the 2013\-16 Ebola outbreak, the IMF established the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust to provide grants for debt relief for the poorest and most vulnerable countries hit by catastrophic natural disasters or public health disasters. *‘Scenario planning helped IMF management to respond quickly with this new Trust by sensitizing them to how the Fund can help stop a non\-economic trigger from causing snowball effects on economic growth and stability,’* says the Director of Strategy **\[E2\]**. *‘I can attest that the OSPA has had a considerable impact on the mindsets of IMF staff... It helps us anticipate and cope with ongoing changes… we feel that we have collectively improved our ability to stay ahead of developments and respond with policy options when the need arises.’* **\[E2\]** 

###  Improving reception of the World Economic Forum’s \(WEF’s\) strategic foresight work with key stakeholders 

 The experience of WEF staff at the OSP, combined with WEF’s collaboration with Ramirez between 2012 and 2014, changed the way WEF approached scenarios and improved the reception of the Forum’s strategic foresight work with key stakeholders and communities as a result. According to WEF’s Head of Society and Innovation, WEF’s new strategic foresight project on future availability of natural resources **\[E4\]** ‘ *differed markedly from previous scenario projects because it focused specifically on a critical insight from Oxford research around the power and importance of surfacing assumptions in scenario practice* **\[R2, 5\]** *.’* **\[E5\]** 

 Application of the OSPA meant that participants perceived and experienced the new scenario method as a form of ‘interesting research’ that revealed competing assumptions, new dynamics, and complex contexts for the management of natural resources. Resulting project publications by WEF experienced a significant increase in media mentions and positive feedback from among Forum communities. *‘The project engaged in workshops and dialogue more than twice the number of participants \(300\) as the average project of its type and duration. The main project was also used to “reframe” strategic conversations around resources with stakeholders – for example, with the members of the Minerals Council of Australia, community groups and Australian policy makers in a series of very challenging but productive workshops,’* confirms WEF’s Head of Society and Innovation. **\[E5\]** 

###  Increasing revenues and prioritising the digital agenda at management consultants Kearney and Atkins 

 Between 2011 and 2018, 128 of Kearney’s international clients participated in the OSP, representing 29 countries; 50 of Kearney’s partners attended \(over 15% of partners\), and 16 VPs and Principals from the company \(194 participants in total\). In the words of Managing Director of Kearney’s internal think\-tank, the Global Business Policy Council: *‘The program with Oxford has led to a wider application of scenario planning across the various practices \(both industry and service sector\) of our organization. This impact cannot be overstated. By involving so many of our partners…we have affected a sea change in the firm’s conceptual point of departure, frame of reference, preferred methodology, and intra\-firm “communities” that champion the Oxford approach to serving the scenario needs of clients. The number of Kearney projects involving scenario planning has risen significantly since the onset of our program with Oxford. So too have the revenues associated with scenario\-related client work.’* **\[E6\]** 

 The OSPA led to prioritisation of the digital agenda at design, engineering, and project management consultancy, Atkins. *‘Impacts have mainly been in the justification for, and adoption of, technology\-led strategy, which has steered the priorities of the whole business,’* says the Director of Strategic Planning \(DSP\). Group Information Services were reorganised at the company in early 2016. Referring to **R1**, the DSP confirms that the OSPA *‘informed the strategy workshops undertaken in 2015 and subsequent years – and was instrumental in the prioritisation of the digital agenda within Atkins over the last few years. In particular, the 2014 and 2015 engagements catalysed the introduction of further external thinking into senior level workshops in the early part of 2015 – including the invitation to representatives from a technology provider and data analytics firm. This brought this area of the business to the fore and progressively changed the way it was articulated externally to the market.’* **\[E7\]** 

###  Tackling technological weakness within the Danish National Police 

 In the context of a comprehensive review of its internal strategic governance structure in autumn 2017 and full review of its corporate strategy, an OSP live case forced the Danish National Police to tackle their severe technological weakness and introduced the OSPA as an internal tool for management. *‘The impact of our participation in the OSP can be documented from the amendments that were made to the corporate strategy to the decision to alter the internal governance structure to accommodate semi\-annual reviews of the strategy in the senior management board. The decision to tackle the ICT assumptions head on resulted in a decision to launch a comprehensive review of the ICT organization of the Danish Police in late 2019, early 2020,’* says the Deputy Director, Strategy and Analysis. **\[E8\]** 

  

###  Diversifying income at Diabetes UK 

 66 staff \(16% of Diabetes UK’s workforce\) have been trained in the OSPA following the Director of Operations’ attendance at the OSP in April 2017. *‘* **\[R1\]** *was used as a guide by the scenarios core team we set up in the charity…it was read by our Chief Exec and Head of Strategy amongst others,’* confirms the Director of Operations. **\[E9\]** 

 The OSPA scenarios led to an assessment of the charity’s portfolio of income generating activities. According to the Director of Operations: *‘The scenarios had highlighted for us the need to engage more in digital healthcare and we have seen an opportunity both to bring in funds through our knowledge assets on diabetes in this area, and also to help shape the digital healthcare agenda for diabetes. We have agreed a staged investment process for several £00k in a programme of work to develop this.’* **\[E9\]** 

 In addition, the OSPA led to a new programme of work on inequalities arising from future scenarios: *‘One of the most striking conclusions we came to from the scenarios thinking was the extent of the new inequalities for some groups and individuals with diabetes that each of our scenarios led to. We have therefore set up a whole programme of work around this area…we are investing in this and have agreed that all our work needs to look through the various different lenses of inequalities that the scenarios highlighted. We are seeing this play out with Covid\-19 as it has highlighted the heightened mortality risks to people with diabetes in the lowest income decile,’* says the Director of Operations. **\[E9\]** 

 The above examples illustrate how the greatest value from the OSPA has come from organisations’ embedding the re\-perception that the OSPA has helped bring about as an input to other processes. In this way, the OSPA has contributed to organisations’ agility and adaptability by maintaining a more open sense of future and delivering new and different thriving and coping options, all of which are key elements of organisational resilience.

 **1. Summary of the impact** José Juan Bigas Luna \(1946\-2013\) is one of Spain’s most important filmmakers. He released seventeen feature films, with considerable international success. This was due largely to his interest in Iberian national, gender and sexual identities and to his talent for launching the careers of now international stars including Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem. The international series of Bigas Luna Tribute events was set up by the filmmaker’s daughter Betty Bigas and Santiago Fouz Hernández. The aim was to consolidate and promote globally the films’ cultural legacy and socio\-historical importance and thereby to deepen understanding of contemporary Spain and Spanish cinema internationally. The events have contributed to Spanish cultural diplomacy, enhanced cinemas’ and festivals’ cultural offer, generated additional income and helped to attract new audiences, as well as transforming audiences’ experience and understanding of the films themselves. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Fouz Hernández’s research on Bigas Luna dates back to a 1999 journal article about the ‘Iberian Trilogy’ \(showcased in all the events\). This was followed by five substantial contributions to edited collections \[R1\(introduction and two chapters\), R4 and R6\], two edited volumes \[R1 and R2\] and dedicated chapters in his first two monographs \[R3 and R5\]. 

 This body of work contextualises and reinterprets the filmmaker’s entire oeuvre by examining the evolution of key narrative and stylistic peculiarities of his work. On the one hand, it critically re\-evaluates the central thematic areas of sex/eroticism, gender roles, and national identities \[R1, R3 and R5\]. On the other, it addresses auteurism and the role of stars associated with Bigas’s work \[R1, R2 and R4\]. By engaging with conceptualisations of affect and sensuality, the research foregrounds the relationship between the film and the viewer that is clearly encouraged by these works \[R1, R2 and R4 in particular\]. It is also concerned with the socio\-historical contexts of the films and their critical reception in Spain and globally. The discussion of eroticism that pervades the research makes an important intervention in studies of sex on the screen by focusing on specific national anxieties around sex and rapidly evolving national, gender and sexual identities in post\-Franco Spain \[R1\-5\].

","
 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The ‘Bigas Luna Tribute’ \(henceforth BLT\) events organised by Fouz Hernández in close collaboration with Betty Bigas, a Barcelona\-based artist and curator, have attracted audiences of approximately 3,000 people, and garnered extensive coverage in print, radio, and screen media \(E1, E2\), consolidating the global legacy of Bigas Luna’s work and enhancing its value. The artist’s family testified that ‘events have considerably expanded both in time and space the influence and lasting significance of his work, keeping it alive with new conversations, new audiences, new research and inspiration for audiences, exhibitors, artists’ \[E8a\]. This was achieved by collaborating with more than 20 cinemas/cultural venues in the private sector and four film/cultural festivals in Australia, Austria, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain, UK, and the USA consistently over a six\-year period \(additional events in Madrid and New York \[E3p\] planned for 2020 are expected to be rescheduled for 2021\). Events attracted approximately 25 sponsors, including Spanish consulates, embassies, and the Instituto Cervantes. Fouz Hernández’s research informed the events, leading to his curation of all 14 film retrospectives and two exhibitions in close collaboration with participating venues and festivals. Fouz Hernández delivered talks before selected films \(25 talks in approximately 60 screenings between 2015 and 2019\), introducing audiences to key findings of his research on Bigas Luna with regards to a\) the tensions between pre\-democratic local stereotypes and European/global expectations in the construction of national identities in democratic Spain \[R1, 5\]; b\) cinematic representations of male and female bodies \[R3\-5\]; c\) haptic visuality \[R1, 2, 4\]; and d\) the filmmaker’s brand of postmodern comedy \[R3, R5\]. In addition, the creation of promotional materials for over 25 exhibits in cinemas/festivals \[E3\] and galleries \[E4\] and participation in over a dozen media interviews \[E1, E2\] provided essential context for the understanding of these works, thus enriching their reception and promotion. The multiple impacts of this work can be described as follows: 

 **1. Raising the profile of Spanish and European cinema and culture and contributing to Spain’s cultural diplomacy.** Fouz Hernández’s activities have significantly raised the global profile of Spanish and European cinema and culture. Prestigious media outlets praised the events. The Manchester BLT was described as ‘unmissable’ in *The Guardian* ‘Guide’ \[E1b; daily circulation of approx. 126,870 in 2020\]. Many leading national and regional newspapers and radio stations in Spain, Mexico, and Australia highlighted aspects of Fouz Hernández’s research on Bigas Luna, and often quoted him as the curator of the event \[E1c: *Diari Ara* \(regional, 126,000 daily readers of print edition\); E1e: *La Tempestad*; E1g: *El país* \(daily circulation of approximately 137, 550 in 2018\); E1i and E1j *The Age* \(approx. 5,320,000 readers monthly\); E1k and E1l, *La nación* \(between 600,000 and 700,000 readers daily\); E2c: Barcelona TV, E2b: Catalunya Radio, E2f: Instituto nacional de la radio Mexico; E2i ‘La Bodeguita’ Australia, E2h: FRED Radio\]. The events attracted the participation of members of the Spanish film industry who had collaborated with Bigas Luna \(a casting director, two filmmakers, a set designer, a scriptwriter and a producer\). They appeared in conversation with Fouz Hernández at the events, a fact that was highlighted by many of the aforementioned media reports, thereby contributing further to the successful promotion of Spanish film culture. 

 The cultural value of the events is further evidenced by the involvement of Spanish cultural institutions such as the Instituto Cervantes \(IC\) in Sydney, Manchester and Vienna, and of consulates of Spain in Australia, Costa Rica and Mexico \[E7c, E7e, E6a\]. The manager of the Spanish Film Festival of Australia described the BLT as one of the festival highlights, adding that it gave ‘prestige’ to the festival and secured the attendance of the Spanish consuls general in Melbourne and Sydney \[E6b\]. The director of the IC in Manchester substantiated this by stating that the very well attended exhibition tour and screening, curated and presented by Fouz Hernández and hosted by the IC in 2019, enhanced their collaboration with the well\-established Spanish and Latin American festival ¡Viva\! in the region \[E7f\]. The involvement of major Spanish cultural organisations and consular representatives testifies to the value of the BLT for Spain’s cultural diplomacy. This was explicitly recognised in the case of Costa Rica, where the government declared the BLT an event of ‘cultural interest’ \[see certificate E7d\], boosting the country’s collaboration with the Embassy of Spain. The point was further emphasised by the Director of Spain’s Cultural Centre in Costa Rica \[E7e\] who highlighted the value of the BLT as an important part of Spain’s ‘International Projection and Cultural Cooperation’ programme \(which also supported events in Australia, Mexico and Manchester through the festivals\). 

 **2. Diversification of international cultural offer and audience development.** The BLT has made a major contribution to diversifying the international cultural offer in 14 major cities around the world: Adelaide, Barcelona, Brisbane, Canberra, Manchester, Melbourne, Mexico City, Newcastle upon Tyne, Perth, San Francisco, San José \(Costa Rica\), Sydney, Valencia \(Spain\) and Vienna. Thanks to the BLT, the 26 venues and four participating film and cultural festivals were able to offer a carefully curated event for local audiences. Overall, approx. 3,000 people have attended events as of end of 2019; of these, approx. 2,500 people purchased tickets to watch the films or attended the exhibitions: 63 screenings in 14 different cities between 2015 and 2019 \[E5, E6\]. These figures do not take into consideration attendance at screenings in Valencia, where the Albatexas cinema manager did not release figures but provided a testimonial \[E5d\] stating that the event’s ‘impact on local media and its cultural prestige’ helped them ‘publicise both film culture and our cinema’. He also highlighted the cultural importance of the event for the region \(all films selected for this retrospective were set in the Valencia region\). Approximately 750 people took advantage of free entry to exhibitions in Newcastle and Manchester \(135 and 223 visitors respectively\), and to screenings in Costa Rica \(approximately 400 people\). The BLT had similar results in other countries, especially attracting audiences that are either Spanish\-speaking \(many of these in the diaspora\) or those interested in Spanish, Hispanic and European cinema and culture. In many cases, these were new audiences, as noted by both the director of the IC in Manchester \[E7f\] and the manager of the Spanish Film Festival of Australia in Melbourne \[E6b\]. 

 The BLT events have not only developed audiences quantitatively, but have also had a qualitative impact on the way in which Bigas Luna’s films have been received by new and established audiences alike. As corroborated in the testimonials provided by venues \[E5\], festivals \[E6\] and attendees \[E9\], the events introduced the work of Bigas Luna to audiences that ‘were not previously familiar with Bigas Luna’s work or with the Spanish cultural themes reflected in the films’ \[E5a – Executive Director Roxy Theatre\] or who ‘hadn’t thought about \[it\] until now’ \[E9 – comments on Newcastle exhibition\]. The introductory presentations before the films were aimed at audiences with no extensive previous knowledge of film theory or Bigas Luna and were described by venue managers, festival directors and audiences as a significant way to ‘broaden the conversation’ and context for the films \[E5a\- Executive Manager Roxy Theatre\], ‘informative’ and ‘clarifying’ \[E6c– coordinator ¡Viva\! Festival\]. The events provided ‘a unique opportunity for local audiences to contextualise the films in their historical and cultural settings, adding considerable value to the event’ and ‘really chang\[ing\] the way in which these films were perceived and understood by our festival audiences’ \[E6b – director of Spanish Film Festival Australia\]. The importance of the underpinning research for the talks and Q&A sessions was also highlighted by venue managers and festival directors: ‘this was a unique opportunity in Mexico City to open up new possibilities to discuss issues of gender and film topics that are still taboo in Mexico and Latin America’ \[E6a – director ‘MICGénero’\]. 

 **3. Enhancing cultural organisations and shaping ways of working.** The curatorial work of Fouz Hernández in collaboration with Betty Bigas intervened in and enhanced four existing film and cultural festivals \(all outside Spain\): ‘¡Vamos\!’ in Newcastle \(2016\), ‘MICGénero’ in Mexico City’ \(2017\), ‘Spanish Film Festival’ in 6 Australian cities \(2018\) and ‘¡Viva\!’ in Manchester, UK \(2019\). The two UK events included four film screenings each, with introductions and Q&As as well as an art exhibition and social receptions inspired by the films and informed by the underpinning research on senses\-based film theory \[R1, R2, R4\]. In addition to co\-curating the two exhibitions \(‘Barbaric Comedies’ in Newcastle in 2016 and Manchester in 2019\) and the BLT retrospective seasons in the four festivals and cinemas in the other cities, Fouz Hernández drew on his research to author exhibition and programme notes tailored to the relevant festival/venue \[examples: E3b, E3g, E3j or E4\] – enhancing organisations’ publicity drives and helping to secure the success and cultural impact of the events. Collaborations with festivals in Mexico and Australia included introductory talks and Q&As, and social events inspired by the films. The scale and success of the activity are fully evidenced by the photographic material \[E10\]. The filmmaker’s family describe these as ‘\[transforming\] what was meant as a small one\-off event into a major cultural experience’ \[E8a\]. 

 The long\-term impact of the BLT on cultural organisations’ ways of working is articulated by the Director of the Spanish Film Festival Australia, who says that the approach will be used as a model for future events: ‘it will impact the way in which we organise future editions by collaborating more closely with academic experts on the films that we include in our programmes’ \[E6b\]. This aspect of the impact is further demonstrated in the enthusiastic collaboration of Spanish institutions that promote Spanish culture internationally. While collaboration between these Spanish institutions and relevant festivals and events is not uncommon, the BLT opened up new possibilities for a more direct collaboration between these institutions and academics: ‘it was the first time that the Instituto had the opportunity to offer a talk directly linked to the festival programme and open to the general public \(…\) offering a new model of collaboration \(…\) that we intend to explore further from now on’ \[E7c – director Instituto Cervantes Sydney\]. 

 **4. Generating income for festival and cinema programmes.** The BLT has had significant economic benefits, helping to generate income for the above\-mentioned festivals and cinemas, both through ticket sales for the specific BLT sessions and also by promoting the cinemas and festival venues and attracting new audiences to their other ‘international film’ events. Figures released by venues in the six Australian cities \(sales in excess of 700 tickets and generating approximately AUD9,000 gross profit\), Barcelona, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, and San Francisco confirm approximately GBP12,000 in total ticket sales \(events in Costa Rica were free and it has not been possible to obtain box office takings figures for Mexico City and Valencia\). The Tyneside Bar Café also reported GBP1,188 additional gross profit from the BLT menu inspired by the films and co\-created in collaboration between their chef and Fouz Hernández \[E5bii\]. This is a substantial amount of income for cinemas at a time when they are struggling to fill seats. There were sold\-out screenings in large venues in San Francisco, Newcastle, Sydney, San José and Manchester. This, as noted by the director of the Spanish film festival of Australia, ‘is an enormous success since retrospective titles are normally not big box office takers’ \[E6b\]. **5.  Enhancing artist legacy and estate.** As suggested by attendance figures, box office takings and testimonials cited in the previous sections, the BLT had a considerable impact on the late filmmaker’s international projection and prestige \(and on income generated by the exhibition of his work\). Not only were these films programmed regularly again \(and internationally\); evidence from testimonials \[E5, E6, E7\] and audiences \[E9\] as well as anecdotal evidence in the Q&A sessions following film screenings and exhibition openings suggests that the BLT introduced the work of this filmmaker and even Spanish cinema to new audiences, including ‘Australian local audiences’ \[E7c – director Instituto Cervantes Sydney\], ‘Costa Rican audiences’ previously unfamiliar with the work of ‘one of Spain’s most important recent filmmakers’ \[E7e – director of the Cultural Centre of Spain in Costa Rica\], or ‘young domestic audiences’ in Valencia \[E5d – manager Albatexas\]. In Newcastle, audience feedback suggested that the event was revealing for those who ‘hadn’t thought about what Spanish culture was until now’, making them ‘more aware of stereotypes of Spain and Spanish culture’ \(E9\). The many materials prepared for the events \(exhibition and programme notes, festival catalogues, postcards, websites and social media presence – E3 – in addition to a dedicated website \(www.bigaslunatribute.info\) and Twitter @bigaslunahomage, Instagram @bigaslunatribute and a 19\-episode podcast \(‘El legado cinematográfico de Bigas Luna’\) maintained by Fouz Hernández\) generated extensive publicity around the world. Importantly, as acknowledged by the filmmaker’s family ‘the success of so many events \[ensured\] the continuation of the BLT and its international expansion which further consolidates \[Bigas Luna’s\] cultural legacy globally’, adding that \(…\) ‘\[by attracting\] very large audiences, as well as very considerable press and media attention around the world \[the events further enhanced his\] film legacy, reputation and sustained presence on the commercial screens in ways that we had not envisaged’ \[E8a\]. The extensive media coverage mentioned by the family has included long reports in national newspapers in Australia \( *The Age* and the 5 State papers of the Fairfax network\), Costa Rica \( *La nación*\), Spain/Mexico \( *El País*\), UK \( *The Guardian* The Guide\), and important regional/State\-wide papers including *The San Francisco Gate* \(approximately 500,000 readers daily\), *Diari Ara* in Barcelona, *Levante* in Valencia \(approximately 266,000 readers annually\) or *La tempestad* in Mexico, as well as interviews on television, radio programmes and podcasts \[E1 and E2\]. In Australia the BLT featured on the cover of the Arts & Entertainment Guide across the Fairfax network as a highlight of the festival \[E1j\]. 

 The posthumous documentary *BigasxBigas* \(2016\) was shown for the first time in Australia, Austria, Costa Rica, Mexico and the UK thanks to the BLT, including Q&A sessions with co\-director Santiago Garrido Rua. As Garrido Rua acknowledges in his testimonial, the BLT allowed his work to reach audiences in 10 cities and five countries \[E8b\] that otherwise would not have seen it or known about it. Moreover, showing *BigasxBigas* in the context of a retrospective considerably enriched the understanding of the film. A ‘Zurbarán fellowship’ in Durham allowed Garrido Rua to complete an unfinished video art piece by Bigas Luna, with the expected premier to take place at a ‘Year of Bigas Luna’ festival in the Valencian ‘City of the Arts and Sciences’ \[E8b\] in 2021. Furthermore, the filmmaker has collaborated with Fouz Hernández on the production of a ‘desktop documentary’ about key imagery and leitmotifs in the work of Bigas Luna, set to be premiered at the same event \[filmmaker testimonial – E8b\]. The BLT’s impact, then, is also felt by contemporary filmmakers whose work extends Bigas Luna’s legacy into present\-day creative practice.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 From 2014 \- 2020, the History Lessons and Our Migration Story projects have co\-ordinated a wide range of stakeholders to promote the development of an inclusive history curriculum in British schools. The primary impact is on understanding, learning and participation, and engaging public and policy understandings, as part of the wider call to ‘decolonise’ the history curriculum, in three areas: 

1.  increased **capacity of teachers and young people**, stimulating learning and changing classroom teaching practice; 

1.  increased **institutional capacity** in history education through collaboration with cultural and educational institutions, exam boards and the third sector; 

1.  informed **public debate/public awareness and political policy formation** with a particular focus on Black British history and the history of migration/empire. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 The case study arises from two related projects \(History Lessons/Our Migration Story – 2013 \- present\), but draws on a decade of collaboration between Alexander, Joya Chatterji \(University of Cambridge\) and the Runnymede Trust. The starting point was ‘the Bengal diaspora’ project, which explored Muslim migration in South Asia and Britain \[1, i\]. The project’s oral history data was developed, in partnership with Runnymede, into a website and teaching resource, Banglastories, aimed at Key Stage 3 curricula \[2\]. 

 Using this resource, in 2011 \- 2012 Alexander and Weekes\-Bernard \(Runnymede\) worked with schools in Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield to undertake family and community history projects \[3, ii\]. These projects led to three key findings: \(1\) that there was an appetite for learning about inclusive histories amongst BME young people; \(2\) that teachers were unsure about how to meet this need in practice; \(3\) that young people of all backgrounds felt a strong relationship to place \[4\]. This work with schools informed the successful Operation Black Vote campaign to retain black history on the national curriculum, and underpinned a separate impact case study, submitted to 2014 sociology and history subpanels. 

 Building on the foregoing work, in 2013 \- 14, Alexander \(at The University of Manchester from 2012\) and Weekes\-Bernard collaborated on a new research project, *History Lessons,* to explore how to support teachers in classrooms \[iii\]. They worked with over 90 Key Stage 3 pupils and teachers in 3 schools, in London and Manchester \[3\]. They also conducted focus groups and an online survey of history teachers to explore barriers to teaching diverse histories \[4\]. Key findings from this research were: \(1\) a decentralised education system undermined the reach of the national curriculum, yet afforded teachers more autonomy in selecting their own curricula; \(2\) that exam boards were a key driver of the curricula delivered by schools; \(3\) that teachers needed bespoke resources and support for delivering inclusive curricula \[4\]. 

 *Our Migration Story* \(OMS\) \[5\] was developed as a direct response to these findings \[6, iv\]. This follow\-on project, led by Alexander in partnership with Weekes\-Bernard and Sundeep Lidher \(Researcher, Runnymede\), coincided with new GCSE modules on migration by the OCR and AQA exam boards. The research team worked with OCR and Martin Spafford \(who wrote the module textbook\), in the design of the resource \[A\]. The team convened four expert roundtables and enlisted the support of leading academic historians, the heads of cultural institutions and researchers based at several archives to identify and provide key resources. Over 80 individuals, drawn from universities, museums and cultural archives contributed to the site. Weekes\-Bernard left Runnymede in Spring 2016 to move to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, and was replaced by Malachi McIntosh. In 2018, Weekes\-Bernard was appointed Deputy Mayor of London and Lidher was appointed as Research Associate on Alexander’s new Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\) funded research project. Lidher was appointed to a lectureship in the Department of History at Kings College, London, from August 2020, with a remit to work with schools and the Black Cultural Archive. In April 2019, McIntosh was appointed as Editor of *Wasafiri*, an online magazine for contemporary writing. All these appointments can be directly linked to contacts/expertise/profile gained from the Making Histories/OMS collaborations \(see \[A\]\). 

 From 2016 \- 2020, supported by an Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) Impact Accelerator Award \(IAA\) \[v\], Alexander and colleagues have: worked with teachers to refine the site; partnered with the Olympias Music Foundation \(OMF\) \[B\] and a Manchester academy school to: \(1\) develop a musical/drama performance; \(2\) disseminate the site through media, public events, teachers’ conferences; and \(3\) collaborate with young people, third sector organisations, exam boards, the Department for Education, and cross\-party politicians seeking to develop a more inclusive history curriculum \[A, B, F\]. Since the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, Alexander’s research team has been working with a range of stakeholders and politicians to promote changes to the curriculum \[A, C, J\].

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The websites are aimed primarily at teachers and pupils, but also appeal to a global audience. Since its launch in October 2016 to December 2020, the OMS website \[5\] has had over 722,000 page ‘hits’ and 317,558 users, with 50% from the UK, and 50% from across the world \[A\]. Since its launch in 2012, and expansion in 2014, the *Making Histories* website \[3\] has had over 28,000 ‘hits’ and over 16,000 users \(52% from the UK, 48% international\). This indicates significant national and international interest in, and reach of, the work \[A\]. 

 **Building the teaching and learning capacity of teachers and young people**: the *History Lessons* project worked with around 90 young people in three schools in London and Manchester, and the *OMS* project worked with an additional 60\+ young people in Manchester \(in partnership with the Olympias Music Foundation\) to collect young people’s migration stories. This project led to 3 performances of a specially commissioned drama based on these stories, *Making Manchester* \(June \- October 2019\), funded by Arts Council England, attended by over 500 people \[B\]. 

 The focus of the *History Lessons* and *OMS* projects was to identify barriers to teaching diverse histories, and support teachers in classrooms. The team conducted two surveys of teachers \(2014, 2018\), and 4 focus groups \(2018\) to identify teachers’ needs and experiences \(see \[4, 5, 6\]\). The team also worked closely with the Schools History Project \(SHP\) and the Historical Association \(HA\), and with teacher training organisations to identify training needs to support teachers in developing and disseminating inclusive curricula. In 2017, the HA said the *“great strength of the Our Migration Story web resources… can be seen in the regular questions and focus points for students alongside support for teachers to help them engage with the sources”* \[C\]. Martin Spafford of the SHP wrote *“This project brought together, in a groundbreaking way, academic historians and schools with a site that enables rigorous study of an issue of crucial importance at a time crying out for understanding based on evidence”* \[D\]. As a direct result of this work, Runnymede conducted further research and teacher training in collaboration with the Travel, Transculturality, and Identity in England, c.1550 \- 1700 \(TIDE\) project \(Nandini Das, Liverpool\) producing a widely cited report ‘Teaching Migration, Belonging, and Empire in Secondary Schools’ \(July 2019\). This work led to TIDE/Runnymede’s Beacon Fellowship Scheme, aimed at training secondary school teachers in inclusive teaching practices \[A\]. 

 **Building institutional capacity:** the projects built capacity for Runnymede and Olympias Music Foundation. More specifically, as a result of this work, Runnymede was enabled to develop its educational research and policy strand \(funding Weekes\-Bernard, Lidher & McIntosh from 2012 \- 2019\), and in so doing, undertake new, related projects on Partition and Empire. The collaboration underpinned Runnymede’s ‘Common Cause’ briefing on developing partnership work between academics and the BME third sector \[E\]. Its collaboration with the Manchester team was key to Runnymede’s role in the Windrush campaign, and its briefings to the Labour Party Education Manifesto in October/November 2019 \[A\]. Jo Cheung of OMF said *“Making Manchester has had a tremendous impact on Olympias Music’s public profile and growth as a charity*…\[it\] *has also been an important opportunity for the charity to leverage new funding…learn new skills and develop innovative ways of working with new and existing partners”* \[B\]. 

 OMS was developed in collaboration with the OCR and AQA exam boards, which have promoted the resource to schools teaching new GCSE modules on migration in the History syllabi. Similarly, EdExcel has recently approached the team for support in revising its History GCSE and A\-level provision \[F\]. The resource included contributions from Black Cultural Archive, National Archive, Imperial War Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Ben Yuri Gallery, London Transport Museum, Migration Museum and Autograph ABP, and linked to their resources, facilitating outreach and engagement with schools and pupils nationally \[5\]. The Royal Historical Society \(RHS\) has described the resource as a *“pioneering effort”,* which has laid “ *essential groundwork”* for the transformation of history teaching \[G\]. RHS President Peter Mandler, who was a member of the History National Curriculum advisory board, tweeted in January 2019 that it’s, “ *Worth underscoring scale of their achievement in bringing migration history to thousands of school students in KS3, OCR and AQA qualifications. One of the unheralded and more positive results of recent qualifications reforms”* \[G\]. The resource has been promoted at 6 national teachers’ conferences in 2017\-18, including SHP \(2017, 2018\), HA, National Union of Teachers \(NUT\), NUT Black and Asian Teachers and Teach First, and in blogs/articles for Institute for Historical Research, *Schools Week*, *Rethinking Education* and *Equaliteach* \[5\]. The OCR course is taught to 2,300 pupils and the AQA course to 9,315 pupils. MacGabhann \(AQA\) notes, *“This website appeals to teachers because it balances considerations of academic rigour with a clear intention to engage all students, regardless of their ability level”,* while Goddard \(OCR\) writes “ *Our Migration Story is an excellent resource that has already had significant impact in the classroom. It is enabling the teaching of previously underrepresented histories and has played a significant role in supporting a more modern and inclusive history curriculum”* \[F\]. 

 **Influencing public debate/public awareness and policy:** The OMS team have participated in over 26 conferences, including York and Cambridge Festivals of Ideas, 3 TV appearances \(including SKY and Newsnight\) and 7 BBC radio appearances. OMS has featured in articles for The Guardian and Media Diversified, and partnered with the Institute of Historical Research on a public event with over 350 attendees. The IHR have used OMS as a case study in their new MOOC on public history \[H\]. 

 The website formed the backbone of the 2020 Runnymede campaign \#TeachRaceMigrationEmpire, which has received extensive coverage in both the mainstream and social media. The campaign hashtag from May\-December 2020 engaged with 16,241 accounts and had nearly 48,000,000 impressions \[I\].  It has received multiple national awards, including the Community Integration Awards \(CIA\) Research Champion \(2017\), the RHS Public History Prize \(2018\) \(online resource\) and the Guardian University Awards \(2019\) Research Impact category. CIA judges wrote *“It is a fantastic project… It enriches the curriculum, makes research relevant and focuses on influencing future generations*” \[H\]. A blog by Alexander was shortlisted for the Wonkhe Awards \(Working in Higher Education\) 2019 \[H\]. 

 The underpinning research and the resultant resource have been recognised across the political spectrum, including by the Department for Education, which described the website as a *“recent valuable addition to the resources available to support teaching of this issue in History*” \[J\]. The team’s work has been taken\-up by the Labour Party’s Shadow Ministers for Equality and Education, and informed the Party’s commitment to the teaching of Black histories \[J\]. Helen Hayes MP has used the work to hold a ‘Westminster Hall debate’ and push for an Early Day motion on the issue of black history \[J\]. She also led a drop\-in day in Parliament, as part of Black History Month 2019, using the OMS resource and tagline ‘Black History is British History’, an event which gained cross\-party support \[A, J\]. Alexander was also invited to submit oral evidence to a Petitions/ Women and Equalities Committee on the History Curriculum on 18<sup>th</sup> November 2020 \[J\]. Hayes writes, *“I have hugely valued the work of the Runnymede Trust in my campaigning on this issue. It is rigorous and academically rooted, but also accessible and clearly communicated. The work on curriculum reform is urgent and extremely timely, and it has been heartening to see the huge growth in interest in this work following the Black Lives Matter protests*” \[J\]. 

 Omar Khan states: *“In my view, the strength and quality of the OMS resource, and the research which underpins it, means it will continue to have significant impact in reshaping history education in Britain in the future”* \[A\].

","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

-  In November 2014 Bryce Evans was awarded £3,104 by the Wellcome Trust to investigate social eating in Britain, 1917\-1919. This research informed Evans’ voluntary work around food poverty and in 2016 he received £2,500 through ‘food poverty tsar’ Frank Field MP to convey his research by recreating national kitchens in ‘breakfast clubs’ in Birkenhead, an area of food poverty earmarked by parliamentary inquiry \(outlined below\). In 2017 Evans received £15,000 in funding from the AHRC’s ‘Gateways to the First World War’ project to recreate the ‘national kitchens’ of the First World War \(WW1\): a nationwide network of  social eating spaces largely staffed by working class women. These recreations took place at public venues across the country, from the English midlands to the Scottish borders. In order to enhance public understanding of this marginalised home front history, Evans pursued creative commemorative initiatives, recreating the lay\-out, music, menus and decoration of national kitchens in large communal venues, accompanying these events with a mini\-lecture and a mini\-exhibition showcasing research. 

-  The context to Evans’ research is the emergence of the food bank.. A Church Action on Poverty report \(May 2013\) estimated that over 500,000 people in the UK were reliant on food banks administered by private charity. This prompted the All Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) to commission a Parliamentary Inquiry into food poverty in Britain, published in December 2014 as ‘Feeding Britain’. Two of its key recommendations were: a\) to guarantee that the ‘new phenomenon’ of the food bank does not evolve into a ‘new poor law’ by pursuing pilot projects in twelve UK regions  as a pathway to a new national zero\-hunger strategy and b\) that a ‘food bank plus’ model of cafes inside food banks emerge, providing a communal experience which would mitigate the stigma of the ‘hand out’ . Caveating his research findings by noting the different contexts, Evans wrote long opinion pieces in The Guardian, BBC News magazine and The Conversation, using his research to respond to a\) by criticising the basic food bank model as inferior to local and national approaches to food poverty 100 years ago; and b\) echoing the inquiry’s call for the ‘food bank plus’ model, advancing the WW1 model as a template. On the back of this, Evans was invited by Maria Eagle MP \(shadow minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\) to convene a parliamentary meeting featuring ‘alternative voices’ on food poverty and in April 2016 briefed the APPG on Hunger, the APPG on Brazil, and the APPG on Agriculture and Food for Development on his research. 

-  A key research finding was that the national kitchens of WW1 functioned with a high degree of local autonomy, targeting local at\-risk individuals and groups. Therefore, in the recreations, specific local groups at risk of food poverty – namely **children during school holidays, the homeless, and the elderly** – were targeted in order to improve provision while using research to educate, inform and entertain. In late May 2015 Evans undertook his first recreation in Birkenhead, targeted at local **children experiencing school holiday hunger**. Evans then undertook similar research\-informed targeted schemes aimed at  **homeless individuals**, for instance in St Ann’s ward, Nottingham. In 2019, availing of university funding, two national kitchens were recreated at Age Concern Liverpool, this time targeting local **elderly people** at risk of malnutrition / underweight using the armband tool of analysis.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact comprised 1\) enhanced public understanding of how approaches to public feeding were of relevance today 2\) the provision of historical context to policy around contemporary food poverty and 3\) nutritional and social benefits to key user groups. 

1.  In order to **enhance public understanding** of how wartime approaches to food poverty resonate today, these creative commemorations were publicised nationally, for example one of the recreation events \[held in Liverpool on 29 March 2017\] featured several times on BBC1’s ‘Breakfast’ show \(7 million viewers\); BBC News 24 \(505,000 viewers\) and BBC North West Tonight \(329,000 viewers\).This publicity inspired innovative commemoration from third parties. Enhanced public understanding of national kitchens is evidenced through emails and letters to Evans from individuals looking to set up their own public feeding schemes based upon the national kitchens model. One wrote ‘I’m not officially under the poverty line. I’m 23 years old and I earn £22,000pa. Sounds good for someone my age, right? But I live in London which means I actually earn around £8,000\-£9,000 pa after taxes and rent. I mention this because I would happily eat every supper at a national kitchen if I knew I was getting meat, veg and, I don’t know, rice and cost only a couple of quid. That’s coming from someone who sees himself as middle\-class.’ Many people asked for pointers on how to recreate national kitchens in their communities, with one woman saying the research had inspired her to ‘lobby politicians and newspapers’ championing this ‘brilliant idea’ for ‘cheap nourishing meals which save on food, fuel, money and time’. Local groups held events exploring social eating as an aspect of WW1 commemoration. For example, in 2018 Evans’ mini\-exhibition was loaned to the Imperial War Museum's *Women's Work 100* project and to a community history project in Devon; in 2019 a National Lottery Heritage Fund project in Harwich, Essex used Evans’ research as the basis for a touring theatrical performance about life during the war. In achieving enhanced public awareness, the research was used by producers from Wall to Wall Television, makers of BAFTA\-nominated *Back in Time for Dinner*, for the follow\-up series *Further Back in Time for Dinner*, which aired on BBC2 in 2017. 

1.  The research added **historical perspective to debate around contemporary UK food policy**. Evans was consulted by several lobby groups including the UK Government Parliamentary Working groups listed above; *Food for Soul* \(an Italian food waste charity\); *Food Train* \(a Scottish non\-profit supporting elderly people in food poverty\); and the Independent Food Aid Network. He was invited to speak at discussions which informed the APPG on Hunger’s subsequent national report ‘Feeding Britain: The first 100 days’ \(APPGH, 2015\) and the APPG on Hunger’s inquiry into school holiday hunger \(APPGH, 2017\) and spoke at workshops as part of the Fabian Society’s report *Hungry for Change* \(2015\) which called for a new Ministry of Food and for local authorities to establish food access plans addressing food insecurity. The Labour Party invited Evans to convene a meeting featuring ‘alternative voices’ on food poverty which included the Association of Public Sector Excellence, Public Health England and Tesco Corporate Social Responsibility. Evans also addressed MPs interested in this issue from the four nations at Portcullis House, Westminster, advising that the UK could borrow from global best practice as well as its history of wartime dining in efforts to diversify food poverty provision, with an emphasis on social eating rather than the basic ‘take away’ food bank. The research helped inform critical debate around food policy, contributing towards reports and political thought leading, in February 2019, to the announcement of a government ‘national index of food insecurity’. 

1.  In **targeting specific groups** at\-risk of food poverty, the events stimulated ideas for action.  On the back of national publicity Evans was invited to provide a public lecture and kitchen at Preston’s 2017 *Feast for Peace* \- a special event organised by city councillors as a riposte to rallies by the *Britain First* group \- at which he claimed national kitchens promoted intercommunality around food, especially for the homeless, children and the elderly. In targeting the **homeless**, anonymous feedback from a participant in one of the recreations read ‘I live on the streets. This was a great opportunity for me to feel human again’ and another ‘this really helps those who are homeless’. A letter from a voluntary worker in Birmingham outlined how the research prompted her to consult local homeless on their daily food budget, calculating that the roll\-out of a new ‘national kitchens’ model would provide them with a £2.50 saving per day. Others spoke of how using food banks left them feeling ‘ashamed and depressed’ but that the national kitchens project ‘socially, has an air of magic to it’ / was an ‘adaptable and transferable model’ / ‘built community’ / ‘inspired us to set up a community kitchen’. The pilot school holiday hunger schemes for **children** in Birkenhead were praised by the Archbishop of Canterbury and led to the roll\-out of food poverty initiatives that moved away from the basic ‘hand out’ food bank model and towards the  WW1 model including \(by 2018\) the establishment of ‘food bank plus’ as best practice alongside ‘hot food for the homeless’ schemes. The implementation of national kitchens for local **elderly** at risk of malnutrition was praised by the manager of Age Concern Liverpool, who wrote to Evans thanking him for the idea of using the armband tool, which was ‘made easier thanks to the party atmosphere’ leading to the identification of ‘two users with low scores on the armband’; she added that ‘we were able to ensure that on their next visits  they were eating properly and their armband scores have since improved.’

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Food allergies are common, affecting approximately 6% of children in high\-income countries. The Enquiring About Tolerance \(EAT\) Study demonstrated that the early introduction of allergenic foods including egg and peanut into an infant's diet appreciably reduced the likelihood of food allergies developing, in participants who adhered to the early introduction regimen. Previous infant feeding guidelines have recommended delaying the introduction of allergenic food. The EAT Study findings have contributed to a paradigm shift, with many countries around the world changing their infant feeding recommendations to advise active introduction of allergenic foods into infants' diets from the time of complementary food introduction. This research has the potential to prevent thousands of children worldwide from developing food allergies every year.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Food allergies are an important child health challenge, affecting approximately 6% of children in high\-income countries. Having a food allergy reduces quality of life and increases risk of potentially fatal adverse reactions. National guidelines in the USA and UK previously recommended delaying the introduction of allergenic foods into the infant diet. In the 2010 United Kingdom Infant Feeding Survey, 45% of mothers of infants 8 to 10 months of age reported not feeding their infant specific foods, especially nuts, eggs and dairy items because of concerns about allergies. 

#  Recognition of the reduction of allergies in children due to early food introduction 

 Observational studies showed that Israeli infants, who had peanut introduced into the diet early, had a risk of peanut allergy one tenth of that in North London Jewish infants, suggesting that early allergic food introduction might protect against food allergy. 

  

 Following this observation, in 2006 Perkin \(at St George’s, University of London \[SGUL\] as Clinical Lecturer and Co\-Principal Investigator\) developed a proposal with Lack \(at King’s College London \[KCL\] as Principal Investigator\) to conduct a unique randomised controlled trial in 1,303 exclusively breastfed infants recruited from the general population to determine whether early introduction of 6 common dietary allergens \(peanut, cooked hen’s egg, cow’s milk, sesame, white fish and wheat\) from 3 months of age \(Early Introduction Group – EIG\) would prevent food allergies, as compared with the Standard Introduction Group \(SIG\) who followed the UK Infant feeding recommendation of exclusive breastfeeding for around 6 months \[1\]. 

 Perkin and Lack successfully applied for funding for the proposed trial \(Enquiring about Tolerance \[EAT\]\) to the Food Standards Agency in 2006. Perkin led the design of the study protocol, at SGUL and then led trial recruitment and the clinical trial team \(12 staff\) throughout the trial period \(Jan 2008 to May 2015\) at KCL, while working half\-time as a Consultant in Paediatric Allergy at SGUHT and being an Honorary Research Fellow at SGUL. Perkin then returned to SGUL to direct the analysis and publication of the EAT Study results in 2016, with continuing FSA grant support. The EAT study Trial Steering Committee Vice\-Chair was Professor David Strachan \(SGUL\). 

 Perkin was lead author of the EAT study primary results publication in the New England Journal of Medicine \[2\]. The key per\-protocol analysis showed that among EIG participants adhering to early food allergen introduction, the risk of allergy to any food was 67% \(95% CI 17% to 87%, P=0.01\) lower than in the SIG \(2.4% vs. 7.3%\). For specific food allergies the risk reductions were particularly marked: peanut was 100% lower \(0% vs. 2.5%, P=0.003\) and egg 75% lower \(1.4% vs. 5.5%, P=0.009\) \[3\]. The early introduction of all 6 foods was not easily achieved but was safe. 

#  Building understanding of early food introduction in specific groups 

 Further EAT reports have reinforced these findings, showing that early allergen introduction intervention was effective in an intention\-to\-treat analysis in EIG infants at high risk of developing food allergy \(those with early onset eczema or early onset food sensitization\) \[3\]. The intervention was also associated with improved infant sleep and fewer serious sleep problems \[4\], and prevented the development of coeliac disease \[5\]. 

 The group also identified that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) groups, who are at increased risk of food allergy, were significantly less likely to adhere to early allergenic food introduction and will require additional support to achieve early introduction \[6\]. EAT remains the largest completed and published trial of early allergenic food introduction to date.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The main results of the EAT Study \(reference \[2\], above\) showed that adherence to early introduction of allergenic foods reduced the risk of food allergy and were reinforced by an accompanying New England Journal of Medicine editorial which concluded that ""early consumption rather than delayed introduction of foods is likely to be more beneficial as a strategy for the primary prevention of food allergy"". EAT is one of only two early introduction trials which attempted introduction of multiple foods \(including foods other than peanut and egg\) and it remains the largest completed early introduction trial to date. A subsequent widely cited systematic review and meta\-analysis including EAT Study data confirmed a significant reduction in both egg and peanut allergy from the early introduction of these foods \[A\]. The EAT study was one of only two peanut trials and one of five egg trials included in the systematic review. For both categories EAT was the largest study included \[A\]. 

#  Influencing international guidelines for infant food introduction 

 The EAT study results have led to a systematic re\-appraisal of how infants are introduced to allergenic foods and many countries have consequently changed their infant feeding recommendations since May 2016, potentially affecting every infant. Where guidelines have recommended the earlier introduction of allergenic foods other than peanut and egg, this is entirely based on results from the EAT Study, since no other study has yet investigated the effects of early introduction of these foods. 

 United States: The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases issued 3 addendum guidelines \(January 2017\) for infants at differing risk levels for development of peanut allergy. Guideline 2 proposes peanut introduction from around 6 months of age in children with mild\-to\-moderate eczema. Guideline 3 proposes peanut be freely introduced into the diet in infants without eczema or any food allergy in accordance with family preferences and cultural practices. Both guidelines 2 and 3 referenced the per\-protocol protective effect seen with early peanut introduction in the EAT study in support of these recommendations \[B\]. 

 Australia: Updated guidelines from the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy \(May 2016\) recommend that all infants, including those at high risk of allergy, should be given allergenic solid foods including peanut butter, cooked egg, dairy and wheat products in the first year of life and referenced the EAT study in support of these recommendations \[C\]. 

 Canada: New Canadian Paediatric Society guidance \(January 2019\) referenced the EAT per\-protocol findings and recommends that common allergenic solids be introduced at around 6 months of age in infants at high risk of developing food allergy, but not before 4 months of age, and guided by the infant’s developmental readiness for food \[D\]. 

 UK: New UK guidelines developed by the Food Allergy Specialist Group of the British Dietetic Association and Paediatric Allergy Group of the British Society for Allergy & Clinical Immunology \(May 2018, Perkin a member\), referencing the EAT study, concluded that the deliberate exclusion or delayed introduction of specific allergenic foods may increase the risk of developing food allergy to the same foods. It recommended that allergenic foods should be introduced to the family diet before 12 months of age, potentially including egg, foods containing peanut and tree nuts, pasteurised dairy foods, fish/seafood and wheat \[E\]. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition \(SACN\) issued new guidance for government \(July 2017\) citing EAT and stating that the deliberate exclusion of peanut or hen’s egg beyond 6 to 12 months of age may increase the risk of allergy to the same foods \[F\]. 

 EU: The European Commission requested that the European Food Safety Authority Panel on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens \(NDA\) review the appropriate age for introduction of complementary feeding into an infant’s diet \[G\]. In contrast to their previous paradigm of allergenic food avoidance, the report concluded that there is no reason to postpone the introduction of potentially allergenic foods \(egg, cereals, fish and peanut\) to a later age than that of other complementary foods as far as the risk of developing atopic diseases is concerned. In investigating the safety of introduction of complementary foods before 6 months, the report referenced the EAT study 38 times. 

#  Influence on food industry and formulation 

 Several food companies have been established since the initial publication of the EAT Study, particularly in the US, to manufacture infant food products containing individual or multiple allergenic foods including Lil Mixins, SpoonfulOne and Ready, Set, Food\! These products specifically aim to facilitate early allergenic food introduction and reference the EAT study on their websites \[H, I\]. 

#  Impact on feeding behaviour 

 Evidence that infant feeding behaviour has changed following the introduction of the new guidelines is now available. In Australia, the introduction of new guidelines citing the EAT Study and recommending allergenic food introduction before 12 months for all infants in 2016 \[C\] was followed by an increase in early allergenic food introduction in Australia from November 2016 onwards, particularly for peanut. Compared with the period 2007 to 2011 when previous guidelines were in operation, the prevalence of peanut introduction by 12 months of age had increased from 28.4% to 88.6%, while the prevalence of egg introduction by 6 months had increased from 25.0% to 57.9% \[J\]. 

 If the same proportion of Australian infants consumed peanut at the EAT per\-protocol level that was achieved by 61% of EAT early introduction participants, then one would anticipate the prevalence of peanut allergy in Australia decreasing by 54%. With currently 1.9% of Australian children developing a peanut allergy, this would prevent approximately 3,200 children every year in Australia alone from developing a potentially life\-threatening condition. Globally, a much larger number of cases of food allergy could be prevented by changes in infant feeding behaviour.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research led by Professor Kilduff at Swansea University on passive heat maintenance and morning priming exercise has transformed the competition day strategies of practitioners in the elite and professional sports domain. These strategies have led to significant performance improvements for elite power\-based athletes and improved movement and performance indicators for international team sport athletes. Within the impact period, this research has been successfully incorporated into competition day preparations for athletes competing at the Commonwealth Games \(Glasgow 2014 and Gold Coast 2018\), Winter Olympic games \(Sochi 2014 and PyeongChang 2018\), Summer Olympic games \(Rio 2016\) and Rugby World cups \(England 2015 and Japan 2019\). In addition, Team GB are currently implementing these procedures in preparation for the upcoming Olympic Games in Tokyo \(2021\) and Beijing \(2022\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 In the context of elite sport, the smallest margins can often make the difference between winning and losing. Sports have several windows of opportunity for practitioners to implement strategies that positively impact performance on competition day. Research led by Professor Kilduff at Swansea University, in collaboration with UK and International sporting partners, has identified two unique opportunities: 1\) the application of **morning priming exercise** to enhance afternoon/evening performance \[ **R1 and R4**\], and 2\) the application of **passive heat maintenance strategies to attenuate the decline in muscle temperature between warm\-up and start of competition, as well as during intervals, leading to enhanced subsequent performance **\[R1, R2, R5 and R6\]**. In both cases, this important, novel programme of research, conducted in truly elite athletes, has developed and provided an evidence\-base for competition day strategies that have been implemented to enhance elite performance on the International stage. 

 **Morning Priming Exercise \[R1, R4\]** 

 The concentration of key hormones, including testosterone, are known to be important for performance in elite power and team\-based athletes. However, testosterone exhibits a circadian rhythm with concentrations peaking in the morning and subsequently decreasing throughout the day. This has important implications for elite performance during afternoon and evening events. Research at Swansea University, conducted in elite athletes, demonstrated how different modes of morning exercise can offset this decline in testosterone concentrations, and thereby enhance subsequent power\-based performance during the afternoon \(countermovement jump by \~4% and repeated sprint performance by \~2% **\[R4\]**\). 

 **Passive Heat Maintenance** **\[R1, R2, R5 and R6\]** 

 Muscle and whole\-body temperature are also important for elite athletic performance. During team sports, there are periods between the warm\-up and competition start, and during intervals, where body temperature can decrease and therefore negatively impact subsequent performance. Swansea University research demonstrated the efficacy of a passive strategy \(wearing a survival jacket\) to offset the decrease in core body temperature observed in elite Rugby Union players during these ‘heat loss windows’ **\[R2, R5, R6\]**. The application of this intervention improved lower body power output \(increase of \~3%\) and repeated sprint performance \(increase of \~2%\) compared to control following both a simulated half\-time period **\[R2, R6\]** and following a simulated period between warm\-up and start of competition **\[R5\]**. In addition, **\[R2\]** showed that combining a passive heat maintenance strategy with a short active ‘re warm\-up’ was more effective for preserving lower body power output and repeated sprint performance compared to either strategy in isolation. 

 More recently, significant funding awarded to Professor Kilduff and Dr Bezodis from the English Institute of Sport and the Welsh Government **\[G5, G6 & G8\]** has facilitated unique research to enhance the underpinning technology used in these passive heat maintenance strategies. This research has developed advanced functional nano and micro\-materials \(e.g., graphene\) into printable, flexible coatings that offer a uniform heat distribution and can be embedded into the bespoke clothing garments required by elite athletes **\[R3\]**. 

 **Combined Competition Day Strategies \[R1\]** 

 **\[R1\]** demonstrated the positive impact of combined pre\-competition strategies \(passive heat maintenance and morning “priming”\) on skeleton bobsleigh performance time \(increase of 3.5% on their key sprint performance indicator\) in elite British skeleton athletes preparing for the Olympics.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The impact and the underpinning research being described in this impact case study are primarily a reflection of Professor Kilduff’s overall contribution in developing and driving the competition day performance preparation domain and in particular his pioneering ability to translate these findings from controlled research situations to real world elite sporting environments. Notably, prior to Prof Kilduff’s research, no passive heat maintenance or morning priming exercise strategies were being used, which highlights the novelty, reach and significance of the impacts achieved. Professor Kilduff’s strategy for achieving such impact is to ensure his work has an applied performance solution focus through continued engagement with key stakeholders at all stages of the research process, as evidenced by the letters of support and significant industry funding associated with this case study. The above strategy has led to the underpinning research having a significant impact on practitioners from a wide range of elite and professional sports, by developing optimal competition day strategies that have been exploited for valuable performance gains.  These novel strategies are unrivalled in providing significant changes to practitioners’ competition day practice at the very highest level of international competition. Ultimately, the research findings have underpinned current preparation strategies for numerous top international rugby teams \(e.g., New Zealand and French Rugby Federation\) and elite Winter \(e.g., Skeleton Bobsleigh\) and Summer \(e.g., Team GB\) Olympic sports teams, ultimately playing a key role in contributing to their recent successes at the Commonwealth Games \(Glasgow 2014 and Gold Coast 2018\), Winter Olympic Games \(Sochi 2014 and PyeongChang 2018\), Summer Olympic Games \(Rio 2016\) and Rugby World Cups \(England 2015 and Japan 2019\). 

 **Impact at the Commonwealth Games** 

 The research findings on passive heat maintenance have been applied to enhance performance by competitors for Team Wales in a significant number of sports, at both the Glasgow \(2014\) and Gold Coast \(2018\) Commonwealth Games. The impact of this work is evidenced by the quotes below. 

 National Performance Director for Swim Wales **\[C1\]**: 

 “**Professor Kilduff’s** research underpinned our competition days strategies centred around warm\-up, passive heat maintenance and morning priming, this research coupled with the expertise of our coaches and performance staff had a significant impact on two of our most successful overall commonwealth games performances. **Professor Kilduff’s** research has had important significance and impact on our practice at Swim Wales.*” 

 Head of Coaching and Performance \(2012\-2018\) for Welsh Athletics **\[C2\]**: 

 “**Professor Kilduff’s** research focusing around the application of passive heat maintenance strategies to elite athletes and specifically it’s application during “heat loss” windows in competition allowed us to gain a performance advantage over our competitors. Probably the best example of this was during the women’s pole vault final where the temperatures were between 15\-16 degrees Celsius with heavy rainfall during an evening session in Glasgow. **Sally Peake used the heat maintenance techniques as part of her competition strategy to great effect and saw her win the silver medal; finishing well above her ranking and even attempting a National record despite the poor weather conditions**.”* 

 **Impact on the Winter and Summer Olympic games** 

 This research has also had a significant impact during the Summer \(Rio 2016\) and Winter \(Sochi 2014 and PyeongChang 2018\) Olympic games, as evidenced by the following excerpts from letters of support: 

 Director of Performance Innovation \(English Institute of Sport\) **\[C3\]**: 

 “*The impact his research has delivered in the area of warm up and ‘competitive readiness’ in elite athletes has directly impacted applied practice and performance on GB’s winter and Summer sport programmes through the implementation by our expert practitioners. This research work has been incorporated into the preparation and competition day strategies for Sochi \(2014\), PyeongChang \(2018\) and Rio \(2016\). In addition, athletes and coaches from a high number of Summer and Winter sports team are currently revisiting this performance priority in preparation for the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo 2020 and Winter Olympic Games in Beijing 2022. Specifically, his research \(papers listed below\) around the application of passive heat maintenance during competition day heat loss windows has transformed our competition day strategies and these changes have led to significant performance gains for our athletes*.” 

 Further support for this comes from the Head of Performance Innovation and Applied Research \(British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association\) **\[C4\]**: 

 “*The research conducted directly within our World Class Performance athletes has allowed our athletes physical performance on the world stage to make tangible improvements. Over the years this work has led to significant improvements in our start time KPI test \(see Cook et al below paper for quantification\). This has had a dramatic impact on overall performance and end ranking.*” 

 A further advancement in this area is our work around printed wearables for passive heat maintenance and the Director of Performance Innovation, English Institute of Sport **\[C3\]** states: 

  

 “*In addition, the recent work we have supported \(grants below\) in collaboration with **Dr Bezodis** and Professor Claypole around the development of a graphene based printed heater will give us a significant performance advantage in our training and preparation strategies and is providing a bespoke performance solution to a major performance issue our sports identified. Approximately 60% of our sports will be using this advancement in wearable heated technology during either the training phases coming into the games and on competition days at the games, based on initial testing it is clear it will have a significant impact on their performances.”* 

 **Impact on International Rugby** 

 Finally, Professor Kilduff’s work in the area of passive heat maintenance and the influence of morning exercise on afternoon performance has had significant reach and impact on the international rugby stage. 

 The Heads of Performance and Strength and Conditioning coaches from 6 of the top 11 international rugby teams \(World rankings \(2016, 2019\), the Rugby Football Union, New Zealand Rugby, Italian Rugby Federation, Australia Rugby, Georgia Rugby and the French Rugby Federation **\[C5\-10\]**, together have stated the following, which clearly highlights the adoption and impact of our work described above. 

 *“ **Professor Kilduff’s** research into the application of passive heat maintenance \(between the warm\-up and start of competition, during half\-time and for our match day substitutes\) and also the use of game day primers has helped transform our game day preparation’s and I feel this is now an extremely important part of our performance programme.”* 

 The Head of Performance for the French Rugby Federation **\[C5\]** went further and stated: 

 “*Since implementing our competition day strategies based on his work, we have consistently seen improvements in our movement characteristics \(as assessed by GPS\) and key performance indicators \(as assessed by performance analysis statistics\) at the beginning of the game and immediately after the half\-time break. We are confident these improvements are down to the implementation of the passive heat maintenance and priming strategies outlined \(key papers listed below\) in **Professor Kilduff’s** research.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UCL’s Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave\-ownership \( **LBS**\) has informed and led evidence\-based discussions about the impact of colonial slavery on British society, economics, and culture. Nationally and internationally, LBS has engaged media professionals and wide public audiences in ongoing debates about slavery, economic accumulation, national identity and race through its open access website \(including a searchable database\), award\-winning documentary, co\-production and outreach activities. Underpinning discussions and policy\-making within governmental bodies and financial institutions on the subject of reparations for slavery, LBS research and collaboration have also provided innovative pedagogic tools for schoolteachers and pupils. They have changed curatorial practises in cultural and heritage organisations such as Tate Britain, fostering the public display of new narratives of race and nation in contemporary Britain. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 LBS research combines quantitative data and qualitative analysis in a body of work that re\-inscribes slavery in historical understanding of the formation of modern Britain. Launched in February 2013, the project’s major outputs, including its open access website and embedded searchable database \( [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/)\) \( **R1**\), have documented awards of compensation made by Parliament to 46,000 slave\-owners following the abolition of slavery in 1833 and traced their wider legacies in Britain. In 2014, LBS research extended to track slave\-ownership in the British Caribbean from c.1763 to abolition in 1833. Between 2014 and December 2020 the database was updated, adding 16,000 new individuals to the known universe of Caribbean slave\-owners and new data on 7,300 Caribbean estates \(each with 15 or more enslaved people\). 

 Nationally, the dominant understanding of Britain’s involvement in slavery has been that Britain was the first country to abolish the slave trade and the first to abolish slavery—an interpretation that has highlighted British commitment to liberal values including racial equality. LBS data and publications have fundamentally disrupted that pervasive narrative by demonstrating 1\) the wide scope of British investment in slave labour from the 1760s to the 1830s and 2\) the extent to which this engagement pervaded and shaped society, culture, identities and economics in Britain beyond emancipation. A major monograph co\-authored by the project team, *Legacies of British Slave\-ownership* \( **R2**\), comprehensively analyses LBS’s database of British slave\-owners and mortgagees who received state compensation for the end of slavery. Chapters by Draper show that up to 10% of British elites directly benefitted from slave\-ownership, revealing that wealth deriving from slave\-ownership was a significant stream in banking, finance, agrarian growth and industrial development. Chapters by Donington, Hall and McClelland demonstrate that the “legacies” of this slave\-ownership flowed into British commerce, politics, philanthropy, fine art collection and the built environment even as Britons worked to conceal their longstanding association with Caribbean slavery. These legacies continue to mark 21<sup>st</sup>\-century corporations, educational institutions, museums and heritage sites, shaping public understandings of race and nation in contemporary Britain \( **R2**\), \( **R3**\). 

 The LBS database \( **R1**\) showed the pervasive presence of slave\-owners across Britain not only in areas where they might be expected – London, Bristol, Liverpool – but also in areas with apparently little direct connection with the slavery business — such as Newcastle\-upon\-Tyne and north\-east England, Exeter, Devon and Pembrokeshire. The database also revealed the disproportionately large numbers of slave\-owners in Scotland, discussed by Draper in \( **R4**\). Draper’s chapter, “British Universities and Caribbean Slavery,” also examines the links between universities, “faculty members” and students as slave\-owners to demonstrate how debts to slavery are embedded within UK higher education institutions \( **R3**\). 

 Hall’s work has led to new understandings of the history of race in Britain. Her case study of Archibald Alison \(in **R5**\) shows that pro\-slavery discourse was part of a wider set of attitudes to race and the social order, nation, class and empire. Hall’s chapter in \( **R2**\) demonstrates the ways in which compensated slave\-owners wrote slave\-ownership out of their family narratives while producing highly racialised narratives of British society, culture and empire.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\). 

 LBS research has enriched and transformed evidence\-based public debate around Britain’s historic and ongoing debt to slavery. Changing the terms of that debate, LBS’s open access website and database have also expanded the range of its participants and audiences. By disrupting abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and of slavery in 1833 as, respectively, the focal point and the end point of Britain’s relationship to Caribbean slavery, LBS has challenged dominant understandings of Britons’ longstanding commitment to liberal values such as racial equality. This work has encouraged a wide range of stakeholders to acknowledge slavery’s profound and enduring effects on modern and contemporary Britain. Working with media, policy\-makers, cultural organisations, charities, educational professionals and students, LBS has stimulated new thinking about race, nation and inequality in Britain. 

 **Raising awareness of Britain’s relationship to slavery:** LBS’s award\-winning website and underlying database \( **R1**\) has been a powerful tool for research by, and engagement with, public stakeholders in the media, including social media. 1,759,811 website users in 224 countries or territories accessed this online resource between 1 August 2013 and 31 December 2020, an average of over 20,000 users per month \( **A**\). Journalists, broadcasters and members of the public have extensively used \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) to inform, report and participate in public debates on slavery, wealth and race in Britain. Peaks in website use that follow specific current events and/or media publications that draw upon LBS research have repeatedly attested to LBS resources’ broader utility for enhancing public understanding of the past. In partnership with film\-maker David Olusoga and the BBC, the LBS team made *Britain’s Forgotten Slave\-owners*, a 2\-part television programme first broadcast in 2015. Inspired by and based on LBS’s research in \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\), this programme revealed to an initial audience of \[TEXT REDACTED\] how modern Britain was built on the profits of slavery. Its July 2015 broadcast led to a spike in LBS website engagement with 227,000 users accessing \( **R1**\) that month \(compared to 6,692 in June\), demonstrating viewers’ active appetite for LBS research. The programme won the 2015 Royal Historical Society Public History Prize for Broadcasting and the 2016 Specialist Factual BAFTA award. The RHS judges commended the series for tackling “an extremely difficult subject in a measured way by showcasing new historical research,” noting that it “explains the complex economics of slavery and encourages viewers to take a better informed and more critical stance on current economic issues” \( **A**\). 

 LBS’s role in engaging and informing public understanding of the past was especially significant during British debates about statues commemorating slave\-traders and slave\-owners and the wider international Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. The LBS database \( **R1**\) and television programme \(featured on BBC iPlayer in July 2020 and still available\) were major resources informing public discussions of Britain’s relationship to slavery. Users of \( **R1**\) rose to 322,000 in June 2020 \(compared to 24,000 in May\). LBS findings were drawn on in social media, the press, and broadcasting to support arguments about individuals’ and institutions’ involvement in slavery and reveal how the legacies of slavery continue to underpin national and racial identities and experiences in Britain today. In the week following 7 June and the toppling in Bristol of the Victorian statue of the slave\-trader Edward Colston, the biggest sources of traffic to \( **R1**\) were the 74,589 referrals via Twitter and Facebook. Tweets highlighting the insights offered by the LBS database garnered substantial interactions and drove traffic to the site as the public were prompted to learn more. Booker Prize winning novelist Bernadine Evaristo shared the website and encouraged followers “To find out how slavery shaped Britain \[…\]. Enter names & you get the FACTS of post\-slavery compensation for many recognisable institutions/companies/ families who flourish today” \(435 retweets, 766 likes\). A London\-based community organiser created a thread of tweets that drew directly upon, and linked to, \( **R1**\) to highlight slave\-ownership within the ancestry of the political establishment \(over 6,200 retweets, 15,000 likes\) \( **B**\). 

 Nationally and internationally, journalists relied upon LBS research, especially \( **R1**\), to inform their reports and interpretations of BLM. In Britain alone, 26 national newspaper articles used LBS research \( **R1**\) between 7 June and 15 August 2020, including prominent articles in the *Daily Telegraph*, the *Guardian*, the *Observer*, the *Financial* *Times*, and the *Daily* *Mail* online. The *Guardian* articles were shared by online users 23,761 times. Many articles that appeared in the national press, particularly in Scotland, cited LBS research: there were 27,007 referrals to the website \( **R1**\) in these weeks. This period also saw at least 58 international news articles cite LBS research, including in *Le* *Monde* \(France\), the *New* *York* *Times* \(USA\), and *Yomiuri* *Shimbun* \(the biggest selling newspaper in Japan\). Two programmes on CBS TV and one on CNN Business featuring McClelland led to a spike in interest in \( **R1**\) in the USA. In the week beginning 9 August, there were more users in the USA \(7,111\) than in Britain \(6,002\) – the first time in the project’s history that British users were outnumbered by those from elsewhere. 

 **Reparation debates and policies:** LBS has had a palpable impact on national and international debates around the role and responsibilities of intergovernmental organisations, states, financial institutions, and universities with respect to slavery and reparations. Internationally, its research has been central to the debate over reparations among the 15 Caribbean states and dependencies within CARICOM, an organisation promoting economic integration and cooperation. The sustained campaign for reparations led by Chairman of the CARICOM Reparations Commission Sir Hilary Beckles, publicly credited as “the chief spokesman of a global movement for racial justice” \( **C**\), has drawn heavily on LBS work in mounting the case for reparations: in 2015 he “credited Draper’s research with shaping much of his own book \[ *Britain’s Black Debt*\],” which “lays out the Caribbean case for reparations” \( **C**\). In 2018, the UN commissioned Draper as an author of \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) to write a report, *Some Potential Lessons from the British Financial Sector's Role in Perpetuating and Ending Chattel Slavery* \( **D**\). This provided historical background for the Financial Sector Commission’s development in 2019 of an “Implementation Toolkit,” a set of practical tools and initiatives to accelerate action by the sector in combatting this modern USD150,000,000,000 industry affecting 40,300,000 people. In June 2020, the Bank of England apologised for the involvement of some of its past governors and directors in the slave trade, and pledged to remove all statues and paintings of them from public display in its headquarters. Reports of this decision, such as in the *Financial Times* \(19 June 2020\), explicitly linked LBS to the Bank’s decision. In 2020 Greene King, one of the largest of the UK’s pub chains and Lloyd's of London, the insurance firm, both committed to pay large sums to Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic \(BAME\) communities after their roles in the slave trade were highlighted by *Daily Telegraph* investigations using \( **R1,R4**\). Responding to LBS research, five universities—Bristol, Cambridge, Glasgow, Nottingham and Nottingham Trent—have investigated their historical links with slavery, an imperative articulated in \( **E**\). As *The Economist* reported in 2020, LBS research “has been critical in pushing institutions, in higher education and beyond, to look into how they benefited from slavery and the slave economy.” The University of Glasgow’s 2018 report, “Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow,” makes 37 references to \( **R1**\). It resulted in the university’s 2019 commitment to establishing a Glasgow\-Caribbean Centre for Development Research with the University of the West Indies, investing £20 million over the next 20 years \( **E**\). 

 **Impacts on Schools, Pupils and Teachers:** LBS research has made a significant contribution to school\-teaching through the development of new pedagogic materials, co\-produced with pupils and teachers, and public engagement activities with UK archives, schools and charities.  With Hackney Archives and two local schools, LBS implemented the Local Roots/Global Routes project in 2015, which facilitated the co\-creation of a Key Stage 3 resource concerning the historic links between Hackney and transatlantic slavery. This was clearly a transformative experience for pupils of African\-Caribbean heritage: one student told LBS that taking part “was for me mental reparations; it repaired me mentally.” In 2015 and 2016, LBS ran work experience weeks for twelve BAME pupils from City and Islington College. The students contributed to the LBS database and learned “how slavery was intertwined with the development of Britain as a nation and how its legacies…can be recognised today,” of which they had been previously unaware \( **F**\). 

 LBS also contributed a section to the Runnymede Trust’s online “Our Migration Story” teaching and learning resource \(launched in 2016\), which showcases the often untold stories of the generations of migrants who came to and shaped the British Isles. OCR and AQA exam boards recommend “Our Migration Story” as a key resource for teaching GCSE history modules on migration, taken by a total of 11,615 students in 2019\-20. The LBS page introduces Britain’s links to slavery and the African diaspora, using \( **R1**\) to structure a student activity to facilitate discovering local connections to the slave trade and received 2,418 views in the impact period \( **G**\). Collaborating with the Historical Association, LBS established and helped staff a Teacher Fellowship \( **HATF**\) to train a cadre of schoolteachers able to inspire colleagues in their own disciplines. In April\-July 2019, 17 UK schoolteachers participated in this professional development scheme. Using LBS research \( **R1, R2**\), they explored how best to teach Britain's complex entanglement in slavery and abolition, and its legacies. Working with Draper and Donington, teachers developed new resources and lesson plans, as well as 14 working principles for future best practise when teaching this subject, which were adopted by the Historical Association in 2019 \( **G**\). The benefit of this “transformative experience” extended beyond the workplace, “this Fellowship was a profoundly important part of my development, not just as a history teacher, but as a citizen of the United Kingdom, coming to terms with this country’s past” \( **G**\). 

 **Cultural institutions and curation:** LBS has worked with major cultural entities to reframe and re\-present the UK’s national narratives surrounding slavery. Many cultural and heritage organisations rely on Oxford University Press’s *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography \( **ODNB**\)* as a key, authoritative reference tool for framing of the national story for public audiences. From 2016, *ODNB* collaborated with LBS to commission and publish 35 new entries for slave\-owners \(of which LBS members wrote 15\) and to amend hundreds more to reflect the LBS data, changing and enlarging the national narrative to recognise Britain’s extended histories of slavery \( **H**\). Informed by LBS research, Tate Britain, the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery have begun a systematic and comprehensive accounting of the legacies of slave\-ownership in their collections of British art. LBS searchable data \(from **R1**\) and collaboration were fundamental to each of these initiatives. Each of the galleries is identifying links between artists and works in their collections and slave\-ownership in order to re\-present the material in their public displays. At the Tate’s request, LBS developed a public statement on the connections of the Gallery to slavery, which was published on the Gallery’s website in 2019. The Head of Research at the Tate writes that LBS “has had a profound impact on Tate’s efforts to account for the legacies of slave\-ownership both in relation to the national collection and the institution’s history” \( **I**\). LBS has also had major impact on the work of both the National Trust for England & Wales and the National Trust for Scotland. The National Trust's September 2020 report on the links between colonialism, slavery and properties in its care cited LBS work \( **R1**\) and \( **R2**\) in its main text and in 29 endnotes, thanking the LBS team for their assistance in its acknowledgements. The National Trust for Scotland's work on addressing the legacy of slavery and empire in its properties amply registers the importance of LBS. The Project Leader for Facing Our Past states that “the real game\-changer for all of us has been this amazing website called the Legacies of British Slave\-ownership” \( **J**\). Providing both high\-calibre, open access data and scholarly expertise on histories of slavery, LBS research has provided cultural organisations and wider publics powerful new resources for navigating contested heritage debates and policies.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Collaborations with major museums of National Socialism, Jewish History and the Holocaust in Great Britain, Europe and South Africa have placed **Shirli Gilbert**, **Neil Gregor**, and **Tony Kushner** at the forefront of national and international public history work. On the basis of their internationally recognised scholarship on diverse aspects of Holocaust memory in perpetrator, victim and ‘bystander’ communities they have been invited to work with curators as well as heritage and community engagement officers on the design of installations, exhibitions and activities at key sites of Holocaust education and commemoration. These include the Nuremberg Party Rally Grounds, the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre, Manchester Jewish Museum and the Imperial War Museum, London. Since 2015 their input has led museums which, collectively, attract in excess of a million visitors a year, to reconsider simplistic master narratives of perpetrators and liberators, integrating victim and survivor perspectives firmly into their accounts, and placing the Holocaust within wider narratives of German, Jewish, European and global history. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning this impact case study has been conducted under the remit of the University of Southampton’s Parkes Institute for Jewish/non\-Jewish Relations, which provides a collaborative intellectual space supported by seminars, symposia and shared projects. 

 Within this context, **Shirli Gilbert** has researched and published extensively on Jewish experiences of the Holocaust. Most recently she has worked on a unique cache of letters written across four decades to and from Rudolph Schwab, a German\-Jewish refugee who arrived in Cape Town in 1936. These have allowed her to explore the diverse ways in which Jews interpreted and responded to shared experiences of the catastrophe and represent a pioneering move in the ongoing work of restoring Jewish voices and perspectives on the Holocaust. This research on Holocaust memory in South Africa examines Jewish responses to anti\-black racism since 1945; specifically, the extent to which German\-Jewish immigrants to South Africa made connections between antisemitism and local racist practices. The impact is underpinned by articles and book chapters, published 2010\-2018 \[ **3.1**\]. 

 **Neil Gregor** has written extensively on the history and legacy of National Socialist rule in Nuremberg, Germany. Working with funding from the DAAD, Humboldt Foundation, British Academy and Leverhulme Trust, he was the first to produce a comprehensive monograph on the city’s attempts, in the post\-war era, to deal with the city’s painful associations with the Nazi past \(the Nuremberg Party Rally Grounds, the Nuremberg Laws, the Nuremberg Trials\). The book elucidated the social and cultural logics underpinning the production of public narratives that still dominate today and has been instrumental in making local curators aware of the lacunae in their current museums. The book won the Fraenkel Prize for Contemporary History in 2008 \[ **3.2**\]. Other publications in both leading scholarly fora and public history projects on aspects of post\-war memory in the city have cemented his reputation in this field \[ **3.3**\]. 

 **Tony Kushner’s** ongoing research on the history of British responses to the Holocaust addresses both Establishment and public reactions since 1945, exploring the ways in which the British have come to script themselves as heroic liberators in self\-serving, triumphalist accounts. He has published an extensive body of work that includes books, articles and chapters on British government responses to the Holocaust \[ **3.4**\]; Britain and the liberation of Belsen, representations of Anne Frank in Britain, representations of the Holocaust in museums, refugee flows in the 1930s/40s, and the intersections of the Holocaust and other histories of racism \[ **3.5**, **3.6**\]. These have challenged, from a wide range of perspectives, the view either that Britain had no connection to the Holocaust or that its role was only as rescuer and liberator. 

 More than the sum of its parts, their work has argued for a greater contextualisation of Holocaust history, and informed new museum practice which: 

-  links Holocaust history to wider narratives of German and European history 

-  connects histories of perpetrators to histories of victims and bystanders 

-  relates histories of the Holocaust to histories of colonialism and genocide 

-  challenges profound ""othering"" tendencies present in popular understandings of the Holocaust 

-  encourages members of the public to see the Holocaust as part of their own history.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 These scholars’ work has burnished the Parkes Institute’s well\-established, international reputation for rigorous historical research into the Holocaust and its legacy, as well as its commitment to promote toleration and respect by engaging non\-academic audiences in memory work. This expertise led institutions from across the UK, Germany and the wider world to invite them to advise on new displays, interpretation and pedagogical activities. The resulting collaborations are challenging cultural tendencies towards the quarantining of the past and the embrace of triumphalist positions, drawing out new connections between the Holocaust and contemporary narratives of migration and racism. Unfamiliar perspectives are facilitating engagement by new audiences \(including children and recent migrants to Europe\) who might otherwise view the Holocaust as alien to their own experience. 

 **Integrating Holocaust, Migration and Apartheid Narratives in South Africa** 

 **Gilbert:** Gilbert’s expertise on Holocaust memory in South Africa led the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre to invite her to co\-curate their new permanent exhibition. Her role was to ensure that the narrative reflected the most recent research on the ‘Final Solution’. The exhibition includes a display box based on her 2017 book on the letters of Rudolf Schwab. The box briefly outlines the subject’s story and how his experiences under Nazism impacted his life and identity as a white South African, making the larger history outlined in the exhibition more accessible for South African visitors. She has also curated a touring exhibition entitled ‘Letters of Loss and Refuge’, whose 55 display panels were based entirely on Gilbert's research. According to Rudolph Schwab’s granddaughter \(who spoke at the opening\) it offers ‘a glimpse into so many family stories that could or could not be told because of the silence of the topic’ \[ **5.1**\].  The opening of the Johannesburg iteration attracted the attention of at least 20 local, regional and national media outlets. From 2017 to 2019 the exhibition visited institutions in South Africa \(Cape Town; Durban; Johannesburg\), Germany \(Hanau\) and Israel \(Jerusalem\). At Hanau \(Schwab’s hometown\) the mayor used the occasion of the exhibition’s opening “to call on politicians and society to stand decisively against Far\-Right tendencies.” \[ **5.2**\] Visitor book comments \[ **5.3**\] attest to the international draw of the exhibition: comments are recorded not only from South Africa but from Europe, the United States, Canada, South America and Australia. They also register its deep resonance. A Brazilian visitor wrote that ‘the texts are written in an easy way that helps us to understand the history’. Another wrote that ‘from a multiracial Jewish family this was an incredibly informative exhibit and museum.’ The large number of schoolchildren’s essays in response to the 'Letters of Loss' exhibition document the exhibition's innovative engagement practice: 11\-year\-old students from three schools in the Cape wrote creative responses to an artefact on display entitled 'If This Trunk Could Talk'. Through this exercise they built and reflected on what they had learned in the exhibition to construct their own narratives of migration \[ **5.4**\]. A selection of the best was published in the *Cape Jewish Chronicle* \(1 December 2017\) \[ **5.5**\]. In November 2020, the Landesschule in Hanau hosted a second display to mark the anniversary of Kristallnacht: in addition to translating the exhibition panels into German the students produced a podcast about what happened in Hanau in November 1938, quoting a letter from the exhibition and referring to the destruction of the city’s synagogue and Jewish cemetery \[ **5.6**\]. 

 **Integrating the Nuremberg Rally Grounds into European Narratives** 

 **Gregor:** In 2015 Nuremberg City Council, the Bavarian state government and German federal government embarked upon an EUR100m conservation project to preserve the crumbling archaeological remains of two iconic components of the Nazi Party Rally Grounds: the Zeppelin Tribune and the Zeppelin Field. Gregor was invited on the basis of his 2009 monograph to address an international public symposium of around 300 stakeholders on the theme ‘Conserve\!  But Why?’  As a result of his contributions to this symposium he was invited in 2017 by Nuremberg City Council to act as historical consultant to the city’s Culture Office as it prepares its new public history offer for the Zeppelin Tribune and Zeppelin Field, scheduled to open in 2025 \[ **5.7**\]. For the City Council Gregor’s ‘international reputation’ provided reassurance that their collaborative endeavours ‘would engage with broader European cultures of memory.’ \[ **5.8**\] His voice is thus leading conversations about one of the most important and sensitive historical museums in the whole of Europe. He has encouraged the local team to update existing exhibition displays to reflect contemporary historical knowledge: as a result, a full ‘re\-write’ of the installation is underway for 2025, into which he will have ongoing input. He has also encouraged the curators to place local histories of violence in their wider European and global historical contexts, to think about the demographic changes in the publics they seek to address \(including, crucially, histories of migration to Germany\) and to rethink the displays accordingly.  This advice has been formalised in a 34\-page summary document which was submitted in November 2018 and presented at a public discussion attended by around 200 local citizens in March 2019 \[ **5.9**\]. The positive reception of his advice led to his invitation in July 2019 to join the newly\-formed Academic Advisory Committee of the Documentation Centre Nuremberg Party Rally Grounds, the creation of which he had himself proposed.  The City Council affirmed that ‘your document was an important step for us in creating a preliminary pedagogical concept which will now be refined further with the Academic Advisory Board’. \[ **5.10**\]  Meanwhile, his advocacy for the ‘Europeanisation’ of the argument of the museum led to his invitation to address an audience at the Bavarian Mission to Brussels in March 2019 to discuss the city’s application to be European City of Culture in 2025, alongside the mayor of Nuremberg and the Bavarian Minister of Education and Culture \[ **5.11**\]. 

 **Moving British Narratives of the Holocaust Beyond Triumphalism/Exceptionalism** 

 **Kushner** In 2015 Kushner was appointed to the Imperial War Museum’s Holocaust Galleries Advisory Board to advise on the replacement of the long\-standing Holocaust displays. The IWM's Content Leader for the Holocaust Galleries sought out Kushner for his 'peerless work on the subject of the Holocaust, and specifically questions of both the ethics of representation and Britain's relationship to the history.' As a member of the Group, he noted, Kushner made 'a critical contribution to the formation of the narrative that forms the basis of the project to create new galleries', which are expected to welcome up to a million visitors a year from July 2021. In addition to helping with the sensitive presentation of filmed testimony of survivors and 'atrocity imagery' Kushner inspired curators to address how questions of time and space shaped experiences of the Holocaust. Crucially, he has helped them to understand the need to avoid 'misleadingly celebratory implications' in its account of Great Britain’s role in rescue activity \[ **5.12**\] Having previously worked as historian of Manchester Jewish Museum \(MJM\), Kushner's relationship with the MJM is just as deeply\-rooted. In 2016 the MJM invited Kushner to join the Historian Advisory Group tasked with advising on a £5m project entitled 'New Audiences, New Experiences', intended to create a new visitor experience to open in the museum's historical Sephardi Synagogue in 2021. The MJM's curator sought Kushner out as 'a critical friend in discussions of sensitive subject matter': partly 'to avoid a ""celebratory"" tone', and partly to use his expertise to 'present a variety of stories rather than a single neat narrative': stories embracing women and children, economic migrants, prostitutes and criminals \[ **5.13**\]. The MJM attracts approximately 15,000 visitors a year and projects a trebling of annual attendance once the new galleries are opened \[ **5.14**\]. In October 2020 Kushner and fellow Holocaust scholars wrote a joint letter to the public enquiry considering plans to erect a Holocaust Memorial in Victoria Park Gardens, a scheme which had gathered widespread political support since its announcement by then Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015. The signatories opposed the plan, noting that the choice of site \(adjoining the Houses of Parliament\) and inclusion of a ‘British Values Learning Centre’ fed a narrowly ‘celebratory narrative’. Their statement was widely reported in the national press. Writing in the *New Statesman* historian Richard J. Evans saluted this protest against ‘the political instrumentalization of the Holocaust.’ The implication that ‘Holocaust\-related learning and research in the UK are inadequate’ was, Evans noted, ‘a grave disservice’ to the ‘excellent’ work of Kushner and the Parkes Centre. \[ **5.15**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Dr Kate Lister has brought the social, cultural, and literary history of sex and sex workers into the mainstream. This has had the impact of challenging stigma about sex and sex work, promoting greater openness in conversations about sex and sexuality, and promoting wellbeing by boosting the self\-esteem of sex\-workers and people with poor body\-image. Lister’s research has contributed to campaigns for improved rights for sex workers and has had an impact on public policy over the Managed Approach to sex work in Leeds. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Lister’s research has changed the perception of sex and sex workers through a better understanding of their history. She has made an extensive social and cultural history of sex and sex workers across the ages, presented through her online research project Whores of Yore \(founded 2015\). This curatorial project is a digital public engagement resource that makes research on sexuality and the history of sex work freely accessible to the public. Whores of Yore disseminates Lister’s research as well as publishing articles by academics, sex workers, activists, artists, therapists, and historians: this combination deliberately aims to break down hierarchies and create conversations around sexuality. It aims to break taboos, by encouraging its audience to ‘Be Curious, Not Judgemental’, as stated in its byline. This interdisciplinary project is grounded in research into material culture, evidenced most strongly in its page on Vintage Erotica, engaging Lister’s collaborative research on exploring the past through its materiality, as represented in her co\-edited book *Paraphernalia\! Victorian Objects* \(Routledge, 2018\), which resulted from a conference on the same name that she co\-organised for the Leeds Centre for Victorian Studies. 

 Lister draws on the research material presented in Whores of Yore in her book *A Curious History of Sex* \(2020\), in order to demonstrate that the ways in which society dictates how sex is culturally understood and performed have varied significantly through the ages.  She points out that humans are the only creatures to stigmatise particular sexual practices, that sex remains a deeply divisive issue around the world, and that sex will never be free of stigma or shame unless we acknowledge where it has come from. 

 Lister has made a particular contribution to understanding the significance of sex work within local history through the online resource, ‘The History of Sex Work in Leeds’. This presents a timeline from the late 18th century to 2017, detailing the work of charitable organisations, police initiatives, outreach programmes, court proceedings, and incidents of violent crime against sex workers. It draws on archival material from Leeds Central Library, Brotherton Library, Police Records at West Yorkshire Archives, newspaper archives, archives at the Basis Yorkshire charity, police reports, court records and press coverage to shed light on how charities, the law, residents and police have responded to sex work over the decades. 

 Lister’s work is an important outworking of the Mission Statement of Leeds Trinity, which espouses ‘principles of dignity, respect, social justice, equality and inclusion … the University is here to make a difference to the people, the professions and the places that we serve’ \(https://www.leedstrinity.ac.uk/about/mission\-vision\-values/\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Research led by Lister has had an impact on \(a\) public attitudes to sex and sexuality; \(b\) wellbeing and body image; \(c\) public understanding of sex workers and sex\-workers’ self\-esteem; and \(d\) public policy. Lister has achieved this impact by using broadcast, print, and social media to disseminate greater knowledge and understanding of these issues, and to promote positive conversations about them. Her work has reached a wide audience, both geographically and numerically, for example: 

-  The Whores of Yore twitter account \(@WhoresofYore\) has **463.8K** followers 

-  Lister’s personal twitter account \(@k8\_lister\) has **21.6K followers** 

-  *A Curious History of Sex* sold **4,500 hardback copies and 3,400 ebook copies in its first 6 months**, and its publication was supported by 1,700 crowdfunding pledges. 

-  Lister has a regular column in *The i Paper* \( [https://inews.co.uk/author/dr\-kate\-lister](https://inews.co.uk/author/dr-kate-lister)\) 

-  Lister’s commissioned pieces for the Wellcome Collection include articles that have been read by over **21K viewers** and a twitter thread that reached **430K Twitter** users \(RileyWellcome2.pdf\) 

 Lister also contributes to *The Guardian* and *BBC History Magazine.* Her media appearances include the Channel 5 programme *My Fantasy* \(September 2017\), a piece on ‘The Modern Face of Sex Work’ on Sky TV’s *Tell Vanessa* \(26 February 2017\). Lister regularly appears on podcasts, including an interview with Hannah Witton on the YouTube podcast *Doing It*  [https://doingitpodcast.co.uk/](https://doingitpodcast.co.uk/) \(631,000 subscribers\). Her public talks include appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, and the Science Museum. 

 **\(a\) Impact on public attitudes towards sex and sexuality** 

 Lister’s impact on public understanding and attitudes is evidenced in positive responses to her twitter feeds such as ‘ **I love everything you are talking about and bringing out into the open for more discussion’** \(Boatierra, WoY\_Tweets.pdf\) and **‘Thank you for your work in disproving that sexuality, namely female sexuality, is just some modern moral shortcoming’** \(La Sirene, WoY\_Tweets.pdf\). 

 Lister’s impact can also be gauged by the popularity of her journalism and web articles, both statistically and in terms of positive responses from readers. Heather Saul, Online Comment Editor and Women's Editor at *The i Paper,* writes that Lister’s articles are ‘ **regularly among our most read stories of the month, and score high on engagement**, which means our readers are more likely to read the whole article, to share it, and to discuss it online.’ They are also popular in terms of the feedback received from readers of all ages: Saul quotes a reader who describes Lister as ‘ **one of your most informative and eloquently entertaining columnists.**’ \(SaulTheiPaper.pdf\). Dr Kirsten Riley, Social Media Manager at the Wellcome Collection, reports that Lister’s article, ‘The metamorphosis of masturbation’ is ‘ **one of our most popular articles on the site and also across social** media**’ \(RileyWellcome2\). Lister’s impact was recognised by her receiving the  [**Sexual Freedom Award for Publicist of the Year 2017**](https://www.sexualfreedomawards.co.uk/2017-finalists). ‘Sexual Freedom Awards promote excellence in sexual performance and services – and acknowledge pioneers in the sexuality field.’ 

 **\(b\) Positive impact on wellbeing and body image** 

 Lister’s work has had a positive impact on the wellbeing of readers and viewers by promoting positive body image. Lister has broken taboos about women’s bodies in popular talks on the history of pubic hair at the Edinburgh Fringe and various talks on the history of the word ‘cunt’, including a talk at the Science Museum and a TEDx Talk  [‘The History of a Nasty Word’](https://www.ted.com/talks/dr_kate_lister_the_history_of_a_nasty_word). Her work has had a particular impact on women and women of colour: Christina Slater described the Whores of Yore Twitter account as a ‘ **sex positive, beauty standard busting, racially inclusive feed … the number 1 healthiest and most helpful of the almost 200 accounts I follow’** \(WoY\_Tweets.pdf\). Nixi Allen wrote on Twitter that **‘your account has done more for me in terms of body acceptance and positivity than anything I have come across’** \(WoY\_Tweets.pdf\). 

 **\(c\)  Impact on public understanding of sex workers and on sex workers’ self\-esteem** 

 Lister has had a particular impact on the public understanding of sex workers, and she has had an impact on the wellbeing and self\-esteem of sex workers by giving them a voice. Lister works closely with Basis Yorkshire, a charity supporting female sex workers and young people experiencing sexual exploitation in Leeds. She has helped raise the profile of their work by hosting their blog on Whores of Yore. Amber Wilson, Business Development and Marketing Manager with Basis, testifies that Whores of Yore raised awareness of **‘significant issues sexworkers face which at the time \(when the blog was launched\) was near impossible to do given the unpopularity and small scale of publicity around our work.’** \(WilsonBasis1.pdf\) Saul’s testimony shows that Lister’s journalism has brought these concerns to the attention of the general public through the national press: ‘Her in\-depth knowledge of the issues surrounding sex work has ensured sex workers are represented in our newspaper’ \(SaulTheiPaper1.pdf\). 

 Lister has also given sex workers a voice by collaborating with them. The online timeline, ‘The History of Sex Work’, was a collaboration with Basis, and this developed into an oral history project, for which Lister was the consultant, resulting in the publication, *Our Voice: Perspectives to Challenge Stigma and Stereotypes Around Sex Work* \(Leeds: Delta, 2017\), supported by the Rosa Fund. Lister enabled five sex workers to tell their stories in a guest\-edited series for the Wellcome Collection, ‘Reframing Sex Work’. As Wilson writes, this project has had the impact of ‘ **Enabling the voices of women who are often less represented in the media through the telling of their story** as part of the Wellcome Collection – not only contributing to the **documentation of a diverse set of voices, but also empowering women** in the knowledge that they have contributed to greater understanding of the issues they and their peers face.’ \(WilsonBasis1.pdf\). Furthermore, by sharing the accounts of sex workers in her articles for The i Paper, Lister has enabled a national paper to ‘give their experiences a platform’ \(SaulTheiPaper1.pdf\). 

 Lister has had the impact of causing readers, viewers, and listeners to rethink their views. After Lister’s Leeds Trinity talk ‘Challenging the Stigma of Sex Work in the Media' \(6 November 2019, audience 186; YouTube trailer audience 550\), an audience member who had come from Germany because she had heard of Lister’s work on Twitter, commented that **‘her charisma in conveying the information … makes you rethink opinions you had had, judgements \[you had made\].**’ Marius Hollenga, wrote on Twitter: **‘Follow @WhoresofYore It will change your perspective on sexuality, sex and sexwork, and humanity in general.’** \(WoY\_Tweets.pdf\) The impact of Lister’s messaging can also be measured by the financial benefits she has brought to Basis, for example by promoting a fundraising event that raised £40,000 \(WilsonBasis1.pdf\). Lister also helped the charity, and publicised their work, by donating the £7,949 proceeds of her book *, A Curious History of Sex* to Basis. 

 Lister has raised awareness of the issue of violence against sex workers \(WilsonBasis1.pdf\), and a video clip Lister made on the subject had 55.6K views on Twitter and was retweeted 200 times. With Basis, Lister co\-designed a Leeds\-based exhibition commemorating the lives of sex workers murdered in the city. For this project, she recruited 17 students to commemorate the last 17 sex workers who were murdered in Leeds and Bradford between 1978 and 2010. Students researched the life of one of the victims and explored how media representations influence social attitudes and the use of derogatory language against sex workers, before producing a piece of writing in remembrance. She was shortlisted as **the Most Innovative**  [Teacher of the Year at the Times Higher Education \(THE\) Awards](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/people/interview-kate-lister) **2020 in recognition of this project.** 

 **\(d\) Impact on public policy** 

 Lister’s research has had an impact on public policy by securing support for Leeds City Council’s ‘Managed Approach’ \(MA\) to sex work in Leeds, which Lister brought to national attention in an article for *The* *i Paper* \(3 August 2018\). The MA permits sex work within a specific zone of the city at particular times of the day and provides sex workers with emotional and practical support and protection from violence. The MA is regularly challenged and Lister has made influential contributions to Leeds City Council’s debates on this matter: her work was cited as a ‘very important piece’ \(Councillor S. Gordon, 14<sup>th</sup> November 2018 at 4:46:05\) in supporting a successful amendment that the MA should be continued but with better resourcing. Basis regularly use Lister’s timeline to challenge misinformation on the MA and they have used it to frame discussion in two national webinars. As Wilson affirms, it ‘continues to be a highly useful reference tool’ \(WilsonBasis1\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Historians of science and medicine at the University of Cambridge, in collaboration with computer game developers, have demonstrated the value of historical research to the creation of ground\-breaking game narratives, and have established new models for how academics can collaborate with the gaming industry. Lauren Kassell's research on the casebooks of sixteenth\-century astrologer Simon Forman formed the basis of the genre\-pushing *Astrologaster*, which has been purchased by over 800,000 people. Helen Anne Curry's research on amateur plant breeding provided content for *Seed*, an award\-winning virtual reality experience. In both cases, historical scholarship led to innovative and academically informed game content. In turn, the games have generated sales revenue and prize funding for the partner companies. *Astrologaster* has been part of a games bundle that has generated over USD8 million for racial justice charities. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Simon Forman’s casebooks document the hopes and worries, many of them health related, of thousands of Elizabethan Londoners. Kassell is the world expert on these documents. Her monograph \[R1\] demonstrates the extent to which Forman used his astrological expertise to secure his patients’ trust. In a survey of practices of recording and preserving casebooks before 1700 \[R2\], she historicised medical writing practices, established the extent to which casebooks shaped medical encounters, and demonstrated that while Forman’s casebooks, and those of his protégé Richard Napier, were typical of the time, they are exceptional in the numbers of consultations they record and the fact that they survive. She used casebooks to understand how practitioners and their patients negotiated shared and competing understandings of fertility \[R3\]. From 2008 to 2019, she headed the Casebooks Project, a team of scholars who transformed Forman’s and Napier’s paper archive into a digital archive. This work produced a digital edition with a critical introduction, an image archive, a dataset, a selection of five hundred fully transcribed cases, and a body of public engagement \[R4\]. This work inspired and informed the development of *Astrologaster*. 

 From her arrival in Cambridge in 2012 until 2016, Curry led a programme of research on the history of plant breeding, giving particular attention to early techniques of genetic manipulation such as radiation and chemicals. Among other findings, this research revealed a heretofore unexamined community of amateur experimentalists who conducted their own investigations in plant breeding with an unusual array of genetic tools, including x\-rays, chemicals, and nuclear radiation \[R5, R6\]. Whereas historians and others have seen genetic technologies as sophisticated tools deployed in laboratories by trained experts, at least until the advent of twenty\-first century DIY biology, Curry's publications document a rich tradition of amateur engagement with genetic technologies in homes and gardens. Accounts of rose breeders scraping radium from clock dials to treat developing buds, marigold lovers attempting to hybridise incompatible varieties with the aid of a chemical bath, and gardeners purchasing ‘atomic\-irradiated seed’ all testify to the existence and extent of this engagement. These accounts served as inspiration and provided essential historical context for *Seed*.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Overview: Kassell’s collaboration with the developer Nyamyam, and Curry’s collaboration with the developer All Seeing Eye \- both facilitated by The Wellcome Trust \- have together established an influential template for the role of historical scholarship in developing new game content, and for broader links between academia and the gaming industry. These collaborations derive jointly from the HPS Department’s culture of engagement, from its research priorities focused on medical and environmental topics, and from its policy of encouraging exploratory conversations with individuals and institutions outside of academia. 

 **Astrologaster** 

 Nyamyam \(http://nyamyam.com/\) released the game *Astrologaster, a comedy written in the stars* in May 2019. It takes inspiration from Simon Forman’s casebooks. The Casebooks Project team \- led by Professor Lauren Kassell and funded by The Wellcome Trust \- acted as historical consultants for the game. Jennifer Schneidereit, developer at Nyamyam, summarises Kassell’s contribution: 

 ‘Astrologaster was inspired by Professor Lauren Kassell's research and would not exist without her. Her work enabled us to understand Elizabethan medical encounters and made it possible for us to design a game that captured historical social dynamics. … Astrologaster is the first game to be developed in dialogue with a historical research project. It establishes a new model for making games. The industry is concerned about a tendency towards homogeneity. Interactions like this one foster the production of innovative work.’ \[E8\] 

 **Forging new computer game genres.** An article in *Prospect* notes Kassell’s role not merely in developing this specific game, but in laying out a new and more sophisticated genre for computer games in general. It profiled Schneidereit, noting that: 

 ‘\[Schneidereit’s\] latest game, currently in development, is *Astrologaster*, a period comedy developed with the writer Katharine Neil that draws on the work of the Cambridge academic Lauren Kassell. … It’s a fascinating mixture of historical enthusiasm and subversive modern comedy, which its creator intends to offer “an interesting and unusual look at history; at the little people, not the kings and queens.” It’s also about as far away in spirit from the Hollywood\-Grecian bluster of *Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey* as you can imagine.’ \[E1\] 

 A later article in *THE* focuses on *Astrologaster* as an example of a game that is having impact by transforming how academics think about what it means to make their work accessible \[E2\]. That article quotes Iain Dodgeon, director of OKRE \(Opening Knowledge across Research and Entertainment, a new UK\-based organisation bringing the research and entertainment sectors closer together\) making the case that ‘Games can help you relate to research through direct experience’: *Astrologaster* is one of Dodgeon’s primary examples. 

 **Grounding game play in history.** Since meeting the team from Nyamyam at a Wellcome\-organised workshop in September 2014, Kassell’s Casebooks team has provided selections of material from Forman’s casebooks and information about his methods and suggested further readings. They commented on Nyamyam’s drafts of successful funding applications from the European Union’s Creative Europe Media and The Wellcome Trust. They read drafts of the character summaries, storylines and scripts and provided feedback about their historical accuracy, encouraging the uses of humour and deliberate anachronism, rather than romanticised nostalgia, to challenge players to think about meanings of health and illness. From the perspective of Casebooks, working on *Astrologaster* contributed to their thinking about the performative nature of the casebooks; about how to \(re\)present the casebooks in the project’s search interface; and about innovative ways to communicate the history of medicine to both academic and non\-academic audiences. 

 **Delivering historical research to new audiences.** The game was on *Shack News*’s list of the twenty most anticipated indie games of 2019 \[E3\]. It received four\-star reviews from the *LA Times* and the *Guardian*, and has been praised in the gaming press and in playthroughs. It was later one of just five games to feature in the *Guardian*’s roundup of culture in 2019 that might ‘make you feel less terrible about the UK election’ \[E4, E5\]. Playthroughs of *Astrologaster* have been watched by over 1 million people. Games players have made hundreds of positive comments about the game at Nyamyam’s twitter feed: for example one Tweeter writes: ‘How am I only just discovering Astrologaster? It combines my two loves – gaming and medical history\! This is perfect\!\!” or @Blackcom666 who tweeted, ‘I’ve finally played \#astrologaster and oh, wow\! The audio quality, the art direction, the researches and style behind the writing. It’s an amazing game which manages to surprise me … Great job to the team @nyamyamgame’ \[E6\]. 

 **Generating charitable funding.** As of July 2020, \[Text Redacted for Publication\] people have purchased the game and generated revenue directly for Nyamyam. However, this number is dwarfed by the 800,000 people who have purchased *Astrologaster* as part of a large bundle of games made available \(for a minimum donation of USD5\) at itch.io in aid of racial justice and equality. The bundle as a whole has now raised in excess of USD8 million for the chosen charities. \[E7\] 

 **Seed** 

 *Seed* took shape with support from the Epic Games and The Wellcome Trust, the two sponsors of the 'Developing Beyond' competition. In February 2017 All\-Seeing Eye was chosen as a semi\-finalist and awarded USD15,000. In July 2017 they were selected as one of three finalists and awarded a further USD60,000. In February 2018, the game \(which remains in prototype as of July 2020\) took the top prize and USD150,000 at the final judging \[E9\]. 

 The Associate Creative Director of All Seeing Eye gives Curry decisive credit for the game’s success: 

 ‘Helen acted as a scientific/historical advisor directly informing several of the key mechanics in the experience. It is no exaggeration to say that our winning of the competition was as a direct result of our collaboration, her work and research input.’ \[E10; see also E11\] 

 The impact of Curry's work with All Seeing Eye's *Seed*, achieved through hands\-on collaboration, game play and media coverage, has been to create a research\-based game experience, to engage wider audiences in the history and science of plant breeding, to encourage games developers in science\-based gaming and novel forms of collaboration, and to demonstrate to scientists the potential of games for communicating ideas. 

 **Bringing reality to virtual reality.** All Seeing Eye submitted a proposal for a game involving experimental plant breeding to the first round of the competition in early 2017. At this point Curry, an established expert in the history of plant breeding was engaged as a collaborator in the project at the recommendation of The Wellcome Trust. Curry shared her knowledge of the history of amateur plant breeding with All Seeing Eye, offering a more relevant starting point for developing the background narrative of *Seed* than that of contemporary laboratory\-based genetic engineering, as had initially been planned. Curry also devised basic plant breeding scenarios based on real\-life examples that the designers incorporated into the game. 

 **Transforming game development.** Curry’s collaboration offered a new model for how a developer could generate revenue in collaboration with academics. As described in a *THE* article, 'Although Mr Kay had initially envisaged a high\-tech virtual reality environment for his game, he soon realised that Dr Curry’s research provided him with a much more unusual aesthetic along with many intriguing details… “We have taken that historic period and such stories to create beautiful visual vignettes,” Mr Kay explained' \[E11\]. 

 As a result of this, Curry’s work has had impact on further revenue\-generating ventures, such as All Seeing Eye’s virtual reality recreation of the ‘Dambusters’ mission \(now installed at the RAF museum in Hendon\). Olie Kay explains: 

 ‘In working on *Seed* with Helen it was evident how historical and scientific consultation/collaboration could be enormously beneficial to our working practices and have a real impact on not only how a project developed, but also the end result. As such we were emboldened to collaborate with several researchers for our Dambusters who again were instrumental to the success of the project.’ \[E10\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Coronary heart disease accounts for nearly 12% of all deaths in the UK and results from abnormal narrowing, or stenosis, of blood vessels feeding the heart. **Instantaneous wave\-free ratio** \(iFR\) is a diagnostic tool, developed at Imperial, to assess the severity of coronary artery stenosis. 

 iFR received a CE mark and FDA approval in 2014 and is now recommended by all major international guidelines to stratify selection of patients to undergo either coronary stenting or bypass surgery. iFR can assess stenosis severity within a few heartbeats and reduces both procedural time and costs by 10% compared to the leading alternative \(Fractional Flow Reserve; FFR\), resulting in a savings of USD896 per patient. Importantly, iFR obviated the need for costly and unpleasant hyperaemic drugs that are required for FFR. By performing the measurement without these drugs, iFR reduced adverse procedural symptoms by 90% relative to FFR. 

 iFR has been licensed to Volcano\-Philips in 2014 and has now been integrated into their product.  It is now being used in more than 5000 clinical cardiac catherization laboratories in more than 30 countries.  iFR has been used more than 100,000 procedures between 2018 and 2020 in Europe alone. The estimated saving in these cases alone is in excess of USD100,000,000.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 <ins>Background</ins> 

 When the left ventricle contracts, it generates waves of blood pressure and flow that propagate along the arteries. When waves reach discontinuities in vessel shape or wall compliance, as occur at vessel branches, some of the wave energy is reflected. With each heartbeat, 100’s to 1000’s of reflected waves superimpose to determine the pressure and flow at each point in the arterial tree. Such a myriad of interacting waves creates a complex dynamic environment that complicates clinical measurements of arterial pressure. A notable example is the catheter\-based measurement of the pressure drop across a coronary stenosis \(a focal narrowing of coronary arteries that feed the heart\) that serves as a key indicator for severity of coronary heart disease, which is a leading cause of death worldwide. The traditional method to measure the pressure drop across a coronary stenosis, known as Fractional Flow Reserve \(FFR\), is performed after administering a powerful vasodilator \(adenosine\) to minimise downstream vessel resistance and thereby reduce the confounding effect of downstream pressure waves. 

 Wave analysis is typically based on Fourier decomposition, but this method is inadequate for analysing arterial flow. That is because Fourier decomposition, producing only sinusoidal waves with no beginning or end, is unable to specify the position of individual wavefronts in space and time, which is necessary to discriminate upstream from downstream waves and account for their interactions. To overcome these limitations, Prof. Kim Parker in 1990 introduced **Wave Intensity Analysis \(WIA\)** to analyse non\-linear wave propagation in arteries. WIA conceptualises pressure and flow waves as a superposition of infinitesimal wavefronts \(as opposed to sinusoidal wavetrains as in Fourier analysis\). Mathematically, WIA is formulated based on Riemann’s method of characteristics, but the equations derived for its practical application are surprisingly simple. By 2000, WIA had been successfully applied to systemic and pulmonary arteries, but these applications were relatively straightforward because all waves could be attributed to primary waves generated by ventricular contraction with superimposed reflections and re\-reflections of these primary waves. 

 <ins>Research Conducted</ins> <ins>since 2000</ins> 

 It was not until 2000 that Parker, working with a team of international colleagues, first applied WIA to coronary arteries of dogs \[R1\]. This is particularly challenging because the downstream arteries that branch from the main coronaries are embedded within heart muscle that cyclically contracts and compresses the vessels during each heartbeat. This generates additional waves and introduces a time\-varying downstream resistance that further complicates the interpretation of pressure measurements in the coronary arteries. 

 Prof. Parker, working closely with colleagues in the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Justin Davies and Professor Jamil Mayet, then applied WIA to analyse pressure and flow waves in the coronary arteries of human patients \[R2\]. This team used WIA to identify the dominant waves and attribute wave generation to the downstream compressive effect of the surrounding heart muscle \[R3\]. Differences in wave propagation between the right and left coronary arteries \(which have the same upstream pressure\) were shown to originate from differences in the strength of muscular contraction between the right and left ventricles \[R4\]. 

 Importantly, WIA revealed a brief **“wave\-free” period** within the coronary arteries that occurs during the middle of the resting or diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. During the wave\-free period, heart muscle relaxes, minimising downstream resistance and reducing the compressive forces responsible for generating pressure waves in the coronary arteries \[R5\]. Identification of the wave\-free period inspired the development of iFR \( **Instantaneous wave\-free ratio**\), the new diagnostic tool capable of assessing the severity of coronary artery stenoses. When using iFR, one first identifies the wave\-free period, then computes the ratio of distal coronary pressure \(downstream of the stenosis\) to upstream aortic pressure during this period. This works because during the wave\-free period, the pressure drop across the coronary stenosis is unaffected by downstream pressure waves and thus the pressure drop can be measured directly using pressure transducers within the angiogenic catheter. Most importantly, this measurement can be done without administering powerful vasodilators. 

 A proof\-of\-concept study with patients indicated that the pressure ratio measured by iFR was a good indicator of the functional effect of the stenosis on flow, and clinical trials were started to compare the efficacy of iFR analysis against the current standard FFR \[R6\]. These studies showed that iFR yields equivalent classification as FFR for coronary stenosis severity, but without requiring the use of powerful hyperaemic drugs that are responsible for adverse procedural symptoms.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Background</ins> 

 Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death, killing 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women per year worldwide. The primary cause is a build\-up of fatty plaque\-like material in the wall of the coronary artery that narrows the artery lumen \(stenosis\). Coronary heart disease is life\-threatening because the stenosis reduces blood flow to the heart, resulting in angina \(chest pain\), heart attack and stroke and can lead to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythm. 

 Coronary heart disease can be treated with drugs or, in more extreme cases, coronary artery bypass surgery or stenting \(placing an intravascular metallic frame to force open the artery\). Each year, stenting is performed in more than 500,000 patients worldwide. Selecting patients for different treatments is often tricky and based on diagnostic angiography, which generates 2D images of the coronary artery lumen. Cardiologists examine these images to decide the best treatment option, but this is subjective and can be inaccurate due to anatomical differences between patients. A more accurate “functional” assessment of the severity of the stenosis can be obtained by measuring the pressure\-drop across the stenosis using iFR or FFR. Pressure is measured by threading a thin wire, or catheter, containing a miniature pressure transducer into the coronary artery, guided from an incision in the femoral or radial artery. 

 <ins>Impact of</ins> <ins>iFR</ins> 

 
Based on pressure measurements in the coronary artery, either iFR or FFR can be used to assess the severity of disease and the need for stenting. However, iFR and FFR differ because FFR requires use of hyperaemic/vasodilatory agents such as adenosine, while iFR does not. Adenosine is a powerful drug that may cause severe chest pain and is counter\-indicated in children, asthmatics and people with low blood pressure. Eliminating the need for adenosine means that the procedure can be performed faster, with less discomfort and risk. iFR can also be performed on patients who are contra\-indicated for adenosine and so could not otherwise undergo FFR for coronary assessment. During the current REF period, clinicians conducted detailed studies on efficacy of iFR as an alternative to FFR. It has been demonstrated that, **relative to FFR, iFR achieves a 90% reduction in adverse procedural symptoms, 10% reduction in procedure time and a 25% reduction in readmissions \[E1, E2\].** Emerging data suggest that iFR is superior to FFR \[E3\]. These are evidence that the scientific advancements from Parker, Davies, and others from Imperial have been successfully translated from research to clinical applications \[E4\]. 

 iFR was CE marked and was approved by the FDA in 2014 \[E5, E6\].  These regulatory approvals provided a springboard for iFR to progress from a research phase to large scale clinical use after 2014. The invention, which was patented by Imperial Innovations in 2010, was licensed to Volcano\-Philips in 2014. iFR is now part of their product offerings and is used in over 5000 catheter labs around the world, having been studied in over 15,000 patients as part of clinical trial \[E7\]. 

 iFR is included in the 2018 clinical guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology \(ESC\) and European Association of Cardio\-Thoracic Surgery \(EACTS\), where **iFR receives a Class IA recommendation** \(meaning that there is general agreement that a treatment is beneficial, useful and effective based on data from multiple randomized clinical trials\) \[E8; see table on page 98\]. In the worldwide 2017 guidelines published by the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions \(among other professional clinical societies\), iFR is included as a measurement tool that can be appropriately used to assess the physiological significance of coronary artery stenosis without use of hyperaemic agents \[E9, see pages 2218 §3 and Table 1.1 on page 2224\]. 

 With its inclusion in worldwide guidelines for cardiologist and its integration into Volcano\-Philips’ interventional cardiology devices, the impact of iFR as a standard diagnostic tool has accelerated since 2018. Outside of clinical trials, it is estimated that such interventional cardiology procedure has been used approximately 400,000 times in Europe alone between 2018 and 2020 \[E10\].  While it is impossible to determine whether iFR made a difference to clinician’s decision in each case, it is not unreasonable to estimate that, iFR helped in at least 50% of cases. Therefore the number of patients benefitted from our underpinning research is estimated to be in hundreds of thousands.  Volcano\-Philips estimated that iFR provides a cost reduction of approximately USD900 per patient \[E11\].  Therefore the estimated cost saving attributed to iFR since 2018 in Europe alone is estimated to be at least USD100,000,000.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 University of Leeds researchers have identified 91 genes which, when mutated, cause a range of clinical disorders with neurological features, including: developmental brain disorders, ciliopathies, renal and liver disease, immunodeficiency, cancer, and blindness. Linking the encoded proteins to inherited diseases has been key to genetics laboratories around the world developing new diagnostic technologies, and national and international screening programmes being implemented. In turn, this has resulted in thousands of diagnostic, carrier, and prenatal tests \- enabling early diagnosis, better clinical management, and improved outcomes for patients. The understanding gained has underpinned successful clinical trials of novel therapies. Importantly, the work has led directly to better counselling and prenatal screening for families. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Seven per cent of the UK population, roughly 3.5 million people, live with a ‘rare disease’. Over 6,000 rare diseases have been documented, of which around 80% have a genetic component and at least a third of these include a neurological component. Twenty years ago genetic testing was only possible in a handful of cases, but a revolution in human genetics technology has led to a huge increase in our understanding of the genetic basis of these conditions, with researchers from Leeds playing a world\-leading role. 

 To address the huge clinical need to diagnose rare inherited neurological disease for effective counselling and, in particular, tackle the specific local healthcare burden of rare recessive disease, researchers from the University of Leeds harnessed the power of molecular neuroscience to accelerate the diagnostic process. In collaboration with families and clinical staff, researchers in Leeds identified 91 genes mutated in different inherited diseases which are either primarily neurological or have neurological involvement. 

 Exemplars of our research include discovering the role of nucleic acid intermediates in causing the inherited encephalopathy Aicardi\-Goutiere syndrome \(AGS\) **\[1\]**; finding that mutations in *ASPM* and six other genes encoding neurogenesis proteins underlie inherited microcephaly **\[2\]**; determining the importance of primary cilia in health and disease **\[3\]**; identifying a series of genes involved in determining human brain size, neuronal development, and neuronal homeostasis **\[4,5\];** and identifying 10% of all the genes known to be mutated in inherited retinal dystrophy \(IRD\), as well as genes involved in glaucoma and corneal dystrophies **\[6\]**. 

 Autosomal dominant and X\-linked conditions can often be solved through family studies, while the trio sequencing approach has proved a powerful technique for identifying *de novo* dominant variants, which account for approximately 40% of children with developmental delay. Leeds has used all of these approaches, but a particular focus for our research has been on autosomal recessive neurological conditions. Our epidemiological investigations in the local Pakistani heritage community demonstrated conclusively, <ins>for the first time</ins><ins>,</ins> a doubling of the risk of congenital disorders, due to the practice of consanguinity. This heightened risk results in an increase in autosomal recessive disorders. These risks were most recently highlighted in the 2016 UK Chief Medical Officer’s report,  [*Generation Genome*](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/chief-medical-officer-annual-report-2016-generation-genome). 

 The many earlier diagnoses made possible by these discoveries have meant earlier intervention \- which saves lives \- as well as enabling informed counselling for patients and their families. These discoveries have provided novel insights into disease pathogenesis, and resulted in the description of novel clinical syndromes.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Worldwide, rare diseases affect 3.5–5.9% of the population, equivalent to around 300 million people. In the UK the prevalence is higher, with around 3.5 million people \(7% of the population\) affected. Babies and children are most likely to be affected, with as many as 30% of those who have a rare disease dying before their fifth birthday **.** Our research has identified 91 genes which, when mutated, cause diverse rare human neurological conditions. This has resulted in: many European laboratories screening for these genes; the identification of these genes on the UK national test directory; and the successful completion of clinical trials involving these genes **\[A\]**. 

 **Influencing new diagnostic technologies and screening programmes worldwide** 

 Our molecular neuroscience research has had a profound impact on the development of new diagnostic technologies, and on national and international screening programmes globally. The Orphanet website **\[B\]** lists the European Medical Laboratories that provide diagnostic tests for specified genes or diseases. If we take the representative ‘Leeds’ genes that were highlighted in section 3, Orphanet shows that *SAMHD1* was tested in 54 laboratories, *ASPM* was tested in 36 laboratories, *HEATR2* in 7 laboratories, *MICU1* in 15 laboratories, *CCND2* in 11 laboratories, and *DRAM2* in 11 laboratories. Other notable genes implicated in disease by our researchers and widely screened by European laboratories include *CEP290* \(142 laboratories\), *TMEM67* \(93 laboratories\), and *LRP5* \(86 laboratories\). 

 Commercial sensitivities mean that the precise number of tests cannot be calculated, but we surveyed 134 European genetic testing laboratories, which allowed us to estimate that <ins>over 50,000 tests were carried out in Europe</ins> <ins>in 2019</ins> <ins>alone for genes implicated through our research</ins> **\[C\]**. The worldwide figure is likely to be much higher, and major genetic sequencing companies globally are testing for genes associated with disease through our research. The world\-renowned geneticist and President of US company ‘PreventionGenetics’ said: 

 *“Tests for all of the genes \[SAMHD1*, *PMS2*, *ASPM*, *TMEM67* and, *NMNAT1\] are on our test menu…. We have identified many patients who carry pathogenic variants in these genes”* **\[D\_i\]**. 

 The Director of Spanish biotechnology company, Sistemas Genómicos, said: 

 *“These genes are crucial in genetic diagnosis, and in our experience, fundamental in this field due to the relatively high number of patients suffering from these genetic conditions. Specifically, in the oncogenetics area, the study of PMS2 is very important….During the year 2019, we carried out 568 genetic analyses, which included this gene. Some of these studies confirmed the suspected clinical diagnosis, which allowed offering \[sic\] an adequate genetic counselling and appropriate medical management to the patient and their families”* **\[D\_ii\]**. 

 The extent of the impact can also be seen within government documentation on the commissioning of genetic tests. For example, the UK National Genomic Test Directory specifies which genomic tests are commissioned by the NHS in England, and lists a core set of genes that must be tested in NHS laboratories. Eighty three of the genes associated with rare neurological diseases by our researchers since 2000 are on the UK list **\[A,E\]**, which features a total of 5851 genes \(i.e. we have contributed 1.4% of identified genes\). The UK Clinical Genetics Society president confirmed that: 

 *“The over one hundred genes linked to human inherited diseases by researchers in Leeds are screened regularly in laboratories across the UK to support clinical diagnosis for patients”* **\[D\_iii\]**. 

 The Clinical Lead for the DECIPHER and the Deciphering Developmental Disorders project based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Hinxton, confirmed that: 

 *“Tests for dozens of genes linked to human inherited diseases by researchers in Leeds…. account for a significant and important contribution to our diagnostic yield”* **\[D\_iiv\]**. 

 The impact of our research is further evidenced by its influence within major genomics projects. For example, the 100,000 Genomes Project, completed in 2018, sequenced 100,000 whole human genomes from patients with rare diseases and their families, and patients with common cancers. The Clinical Director of Genomics England, confirmed that the genes we identified: 

 *“accounted for a significant proportion* *of activity across the 100,000 Genomes Project*” **\[D\_v\]**. 

 The co\-lead investigator of the Scottish Genomes partnership said that: 

 *“The many rare disease genes discovered by researchers in Leeds played a key role in helping to understand causes, diagnosis, and potential treatments for such inherited diseases”* **\[D\_vi\]**. 

 **New understanding underpins clinical trials of novel therapies** 

 The molecular neuroscience research findings from Leeds have allowed clinicians to compare patients from different centres who have variants in a single gene. This has guided clinical decision\-making, as well as the novel research insights informing clinical trial design. Examples include drug trials in patients with *TREX1* and *PLA2G6* mutations; personalised medicine approaches and drug trials for specific cancer subgroups \(including *PMS2* and *TET2* mutation carriers\); *CEP290* variants targeted by antisense oligo therapy; drug, dietary and physiotherapy approaches being tested in Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia \(PCD\) patients; and the use of anti\-ADAM9 antibodies as a tumour therapy \[ **F**\]. For example, a clinical trial of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD, caused by mutations in six of the genes implicated through Leeds research, showed this halved the rate of respiratory exacerbations **\[G\]**. Moreover, our research on AGS, caused by mutations in *SAMHD1* and four other genes \(all identified at UoL\) led directly to a clinical trial of baricitinib, which proved effective in improving patients’ neurological outcomes **\[H\]**. 

 **Improved health and wellbeing through diagnosis, counselling and better treatment** 

 Discovery of the 91 genes through neuroscience research at the University of Leeds has enabled early diagnosis, better management, and improved outcomes for patients, and better counselling and prenatal screening for families. The importance of this impact was highlighted by IRD patients \(19 genes implicated through Leeds research\) who reported that they strongly supported the provision of publicly funded genetic testing. The IRD patients valued the greater understanding and knowledge about the genetic basis of their condition, and valued the resulting early access to emerging therapies. The patients also reported benefits to family members and future generations, as well as to society in general **\[I\]**. 

 Our research has allowed charities to better support families living with rare conditions. According to the CEO of Unique, a charity supporting people with rare chromosome and gene disorders: 

 *“The \[Leeds\] research has provided important insights that directly benefit those affected by genetic mutations. In particular the discovery that blindness is due to mutations in splicing factors PRPF8 and 3, the identified relationship between retinal vascular disease and TSPAN12 variants, and the finding of diverse immunological phenotypes due to CARD11 mutations has allowed a genetic diagnosis to be made – diagnoses which directly improve the quality of life for affected individuals within the UK and throughout the world”* **\[D\_vii\]**. 

 The CEO of Cerebra, a charity that helps children with genetic brain conditions, said: 

 *“….the fundamental genetics research at the University of Leeds has led to improvements in genetic identification that have significantly improved the lives of our members and have given them and us new hope for the future.….. This new understanding allows our members to obtain a genetic diagnosis, which gives them a much better idea of what the future holds for them, something in which we and they place great value. It also gives information about risk for other family members and future generations, is the first step towards better treatments and new therapies and is an essential prerequisite for recruitment to clinical trials”* **\[D\_viii\]**. 

 The CEO of Retina UK, a patient\-led charity supporting people with retinal diseases, confirmed: 

 *“the Leeds Vision Research Group has played a world\-leading role in the drive towards a genetic diagnosis for everybody with inherited retinal disease. Knowledge of their genotype is something our members value very highly indeed, since it is the essential first step in the journey towards understanding their condition and accessing the best possible treatment”* **\[D\_ix\]**. 

 The Board of the Ciliopathy Alliance have recognised the vital importance of the Leeds research and the impact it has had on families affected by ciliopathies: 

 *“Leeds geneticists have excelled over the past 10 years, identifying over 100 genes linked to inherited diseases. These include 29 genes that, when mutated, cause ciliopathies. This is a huge contribution to the worldwide human genetics revolution from a single centre. Linking genes with inherited diseases means patients and their families can plan their lives knowing how their condition is likely to progress and what risk it poses to relatives”* **\[D\_x\]**. 

 The impact of this research is best expressed by the patients who benefit from the findings. For example, a patient with VEXAS syndrome \(due to a somatic mutation in *UBA1*\) wrote that: 

 *“For four years I have battled with a progressive illness… Last year I was told that I was unlikely to survive more than another 6\-12 months, and to complete a DNR Form, write my will, etc. It therefore came as a massive relief to discover at the end of last year that your team had described a syndrome that exactly matched my own illness…. I feel that my symptoms are benefiting from a combination of steroids and a monoclonal antibody”* **\[J\]** *.*

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 BAME GBMSM communities disproportionately receive a later diagnosis of the human immunodeficiency virus \(HIV\) when compared to white GBMSM and heterosexuals, adversely impacting health and psychological well\-being. BAME GBMSM also face mental\-health inequalities associated with increased stress. DMU’s research team have provided evidence that has changed how third sector service providers work with BAME GBMSM, improving the inclusion, health and well\-being outcomes of these marginalised groups. Specifically, in response to DMU’s service evaluation and a 29% increase of BAME GBMSM attending workshops, a pre\-existing coaching service in London was expanded to create new BAME GBMSM\-specific provision, *Mosaic*. Another new service, *Dosti*, is being run by the first South Asian support worker in Leicester, which has tripled membership and increased the number receiving sexual\-health support. Finally, 275 South Asian GBMSM tested for HIV in London, Leeds and Bradford as a result of the DMU research–informed public awareness health campaign, *Sholay Love*, that has also aimed to further the global public health media debate around South Asian GBMSM requiring specific intervention \(South Asian BAME have been found to be least likely to test for HIV\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In response to the sexual\-health disparities and mental\-health inequalities within BAME GBMSM communities, Public Health England commissioned an unprecedented evaluative research project funded by MAC AIDS Foundation \(charitable arm of the cosmetic company MAC\) that could inform future interventions for these marginalised communities. DMU won this competitive tender and completed a project titled, ‘Evaluating interventions for black and ethnic minority men who have sex with men’ \(GBP38,404, 2014–2015\). 

 The evaluative research project led to a Public Health England report in 2016 \[R1\] that included a systematic review by DMU of the few existing interventions for BAME GMSM, most of which were from countries outside England, and a mixed\-methods evaluation study of 3 interventions run by charities in England. The first intervention evaluated was a cognitive\-behavioral therapy programme run by the charity METRO, in London, to understand the evidence behind combining HIV prevention, testing and care with psychological therapy for BAME GBMSM. Thanks to the programme, men showed improvements from pre\- to post\-intervention in psychological well\-being and self\-efficacy. In interviews, men reported that the service was culturally appropriate and that it was a non\-judgemental safe space. The second intervention considered workshops using coaching and counselling principles to support gay identity and understand motivations behind risky behaviours. Four workshops were run with charity The Quest and pre/post\-intervention data showed significant improvements in decreasing internalised homophobia, increasing self\-esteem, increasing self\-efficacy, increasing psychological well\-being and decreasing intention to engage in sex on drugs. The men reported they felt better equipped to develop meaningful non\-sexual relationships, and that they were provided strategies to increase intimacy and decrease ‘dysfunctional’ uses of sex to make better ‘health related choices around sex’. The third intervention was with the charity NAZ, and their Selfie Programme, which aimed to develop a positive sexual identity and empower men to promote sexual health in their communities. Results of the pre/post\-intervention questionnaires showed significant improvements on measures of attitudes towards condom use, sexual risk\-taking, attitudes towards alcohol, sense of continuity, perceived access to public services and participation in sex using drugs. In the qualitative interviews, participants said there was a benefit when information was delivered in their native language and that there was a sense of social identity formed from being in a group with others who have the same ethno\-cultural heritage. Participation in the groups also decreased feelings of anxiety and depression, and those living with HIV felt they could disclose their status and their depression within the groups. Findings from the 3 interventions in the governmental \-commissioned DMU report concluded there was a lack of theoretically, culturally sensitive and evidence\-based interventions for BAME GBMSM while suggesting principles for enhanced provision \[R1\]. 

 The disparities experienced by BAME GBMSM have been explained by psychologists at DMU using Identity Process Theory, which explains identity threats associated with sexuality, religion and ethnicity. The sexual identity of BAME GBMSM is often incongruent with their religious and ethnic identities, due to a high prevalence of homophobia and social exclusion in their ethno\-cultural communities, while their well\-being when on the gay scene is also at threat due to religious and ethnic prejudice from other GBMSM. This can result in difficulties establishing close interpersonal relationships, low self\-esteem and increased susceptibility to other negative psychological outcomes \[R2\]. Mental\-health inequalities result in higher rates of depression in BAME GBMSM due to discrimination, rejection, racism, internalised homophobia and not disclosing their gay identity, when compared to whites. Depression in this group is mediated by situational stress. Compared to white GBMSM, BAME GBMSM use more problematic coping strategies, including drugs, when faced with stress, and are less likely to seek support. The higher rates of suicidal ideation amongst BAME GBMSM are also related to higher rates of internalised homophobia. Having a space where BAME GBMSM feel safe to seek help acts a buffer against the situational stress that can result in suicidal ideation and depression \[R3\]. 

 Further research by psychologists at DMU has highlighted the key barriers to HIV prevention and HIV care, including perceived homophobia and racism towards ethnic minorities, which specifically leads to a decrease in willingness to test for HIV. BAME GBMSM prefer testing in a community setting, through a charity, rather than using a medical clinic, with the men feeling more comfortable with those who share similar ethnic backgrounds to their own. In the pre\-test questionnaires, which asked about testing for HIV, the results suggest it is less intrusive to test for HIV in community settings as this decreases perceived stigma and builds rapport with the community worker \[R4\]. Among BAME GBMSM there is less knowledge around HIV, when compared to white GBMSM. Specifically, South Asian GBMSM score the lowest of all BAME groups for knowledge of HIV and think it is less likely they would have been exposed to HIV, resulting in less engagement in testing and higher rates of a late diagnosis. The research findings recommend that an awareness raising campaign could further educate this group to increase the rate of HIV testing among Asian GBMSM \[R5\]. Ground\-breaking research was further conducted on pre\-exposure prophylaxis \(PrEP\), an effective biomedical approach to prevent HIV transmission. There are several barriers to using PrEP, such as use of stigmatising terminology and low HIV risk appraisal. PrEP acceptability can be increased by introducing PrEP to the GBMSM service users following a negative HIV test. This innovative research, on a drug that was in clinical trials until July 2020 and is to become available on the NHS, has provided DMU researchers with a specialised skillset in sexual health that is under researched \[R6\]. Overall, the first service evaluation of interventions and the subsequent publications provide psychologists at DMU with specialised and distinct expertise to improve third sector services’ approach when creating interventions for both the mental and sexual health of BAME GBMSM.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The findings from both the governmental Public Health England report commissioned from DMU and the published research by DMU have provided evidence that has changed how third sector services work with BAME GBMSM, specifically through adopting theoretically informed culturally sensitive and evidence\-based interventions. Charities such as The Quest, Trade and NAZ have implemented findings from DMU’s service evaluation research and have decreased not only the disparities and inequalities BAME GBMSM face, but have improved inclusion within services for BAME, most notably British Asian GBMSM. More detail, with examples of the impact delivered to third sector organisation, is provided below: 

##  \(1\) The QUEST Programmes 

 The Quest, a London\-based charity, run a range of coaching/​counselling, psycho\-education and peer\-support interventions to enhance GBMSM’s well\-being. In their workshops, men explore their motivations for risky and negative coping behaviours through a range of activities to buffer low mood, poor self\-esteem and anxiety. The charity found DMU’s service evaluation research essential due to the prior lack of systematic evidence and theory to improve service interventions for minority groups: ‘This has been very worrying as data suggest higher rates of depression, internalised shame, self\-harm behaviours and HIV in gay and bisexual men in many British BAME communities’ \[C1\]. DMU’s service evaluation findings were applied when BAME men began to comprise 29% of attendees in workshops in 2019. In response, The Quest prepared to diversify their provision by focusing on BAME GBMSM in the development and launch of Quest Mosaic for Black, Asian and other racially minoritised men. The Quest have made several enhancements to their practice. ‘To ensure efficacy of the workshops, The Quest have consulted with Dr Williamson to look at appropriate well\-being measures which might be useful in gathering further evidence’ \[C1\]. They have now adopted the use of quantitative measures before and after interventions to assess self\-reported benefits. This provides a systematic form of evaluation that has an in\-depth approach, complementing qualitative data that previously was used exclusively. Using pre\- and post\-intervention tests has also provided them a robustness to their evaluations that cannot be achieved using only qualitative measures. The Quest have also directly responded to two criticisms from DMU’s service evaluation research in their design and implementation of *Mosaic*: \(1\) they have introduced differentiated coaching for individuals and group coaching, with up to 6 participants at one time, in response to feedback from some participants that group numbers were too big, and \(2\), they have ensured that all Mosaic services are facilitated by GBMSM coaches from BAME backgrounds, as some participants are ‘reluctant to take part in a service where they anticipate that some of the facilitators are white’, and this is reflected in their marketing strategy \[C1\]. 

##  \(2\) Dosti 

 Trade Sexual Health is a Leicester\-based charity that serves over 2,000 individuals from the LGBT community. Trade Sexual Health states that DMU’s research expertise, particularly in Identity Process Theory, has provided the charity with insight into inclusion barriers, including social support and well\-being \[C2\]. These barriers to engagement are further based on the complexities of having a sexual, religious and ethnic identity that may be conflicted: ‘Identity theory has helped in the delivery of practical and emotional in\-depth support to these individuals \[and\] provided support and evidence for a successful funding bid to support *Dosti* … enabling continued peer\-led emotional and social support’ \[C2\]. *Dosti* is a peer\-to\-peer support group facilitated by the first GBMSM Support Worker in Leicester who has the same ethno\-cultural background as the members, which was also a role created as part of the funding bid supported by DMU. Based on its success *Dosti* continues to run monthly meetings and has tripled its membership. The group has a vibrant presence on social media, which has provided ‘further opportunities, such as training for South Asian targeted services \(mental health\) on LGBT awareness in Leicester’ \[C2\]. The group has improved the well\-being of BAME GBMSM who, according to DMU’s research, are at high risk of depressive symptoms. Group members have reported increased ‘self\-confidence, \[and\] reduced social isolation, through Trade’s on\-site and outreach sexual\-health screening clinics, in partnership with Leicester Sexual Health, and \[through\] rapid HIV testing clinics, delivered by staff and volunteers’ \[C2\]. Having community members receive HIV testing from charities and by people with a similar ethnic background to their own was found to increase the likelihood of testing for HIV and acceptance of PrEP in DMU’s research. Comments from group members also indicate that *Dosti* has increased inclusion by both having ‘their feelings and identity validated and \[being\] able to be their authentic selves, even if just for a short period of time’ \[C2\]. 

##  \(3\) Sholay Love 

 NAZ, a BAME sexual\-health charity that provides services in 13 boroughs across London, describes the overall research by DMU as ‘vital in transforming the organisation … \[into a\] thought leader providing an evidence base of sexual\-health interventions and advocating for the needs of BAME sexual health at policy and government level’ \[C3\]. As a result, NAZ conducted their first service evaluation of over 300 BAME GBMSM, with survey results changing the way they create and deliver services. The research by DMU on Identity Process Theory has also informed NAZ’s prevention strategy and sexual\-health service delivery. DMU’s research on sexual\-health and mental\-health inequalities has also fostered inclusion in service delivery ‘to offer a combined sexual, mental, advocacy and referral offer to BAME MSM which is tailored differently to the offer for White MSM’ \[C3\]. The research expertise of DMU on HIV testing and sexual health has informed NAZ’s creation of the public awareness campaign, *Sholay Love*, a sexual\-health amplification campaign targeting South Asian GBMSM at risk of acquiring HIV. The campaign was funded by the Public Health England Innovation Fund for HIV and led by NAZ in collaboration with the charity Yorkshire MESMAC to expand the reach of testing for HIV within the charities’ locations in London, Leeds and Bradford. The sexual\-health amplification programme has been featured as part of a dual broadcast between BBC Asian Network and Victoria Derbyshire/​BBC2 \[C4\], which have an international reach \[C3\]. Professor Jaspal was featured in the international broadcasts as an expert on South Asian GBMSM and HIV, adding to the public media debate, stating, ‘We know that South Asian gay and bisexual men are less likely to engage with sexual\-health services then other ethnic minority groups and the white British majority.’ \[C4\] This international debate that South Asian GBMSM are the BAME GBMSM group least likely, without intervention, to engage with sexual\-health services to test for HIV has shaped *Sholay Love* to increase South Asian GBMSM’s testing for HIV \[C4\]. In a news article by OUTNEWS Global, who have an international readership of LGBT individuals, DMU’s research was cited again with the launch of *Sholay Love*, continuing to provide evidence, as part of the public global debate, that South Asian GBMSM are unlikely to test for HIV due to the cultural identity of this group. The article states, ‘South Asian MSM are less likely to access sexual\-health screening … less likely to discuss HIV … and possess the least knowledge of HIV’ \[C5\]. The *Sholay Love* campaign resulted in the HIV testing of 275 South Asian men and reached thousands of South Asian men through outreach, workshops and online resources \[C6\]. In recognition for the role his research has played in shaping a culturally sensitive service for South Asian GBMSM, who are service users at NAZ, Professor Jaspal received the South Asian nOSCAR award \[C7\]. The nOSCAR celebrates those who have either worked to increase the representation of South Asians or improved the delivery of culturally sensitive services. A second award by NAZ, the Ten out of Ten Award, was bestowed upon Professor Jaspal for his research on HIV and BAME GBMSM. This award honoured individuals ‘mainly from minority communities \[as\] minority communities have, and continue to be, disproportionately impacted by HIV’ \[C8\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Sexual exploitation and abuse \(SEA\) of adults and children perpetrated by UN peacekeeping personnel and humanitarian aid workers has been a longstanding issue that undermines the positive work of those missions. Professor Rosa Freedman’s work, in collaboration with the British NGO Keeping Children Safe \(KCS\), has led to the development and use of a toolkit for assessing risk and ensuring stronger safeguarding and protection of adults and children by international organisations contributing to peacekeeping or providing aid. The toolkit has been used by leading organisations in many countries, and has changed global and UK domestic practice and policies on safeguarding against sexual exploitation and abuse. These organisations include the UN and its agencies, Foreign and Commonwealth Office \(FCO\), Department for International Development \(DFID\), global regional organisations, national armed forces and Non Government Organisations \(NGOs\) operating globally. This change means that more effective safeguarding is in place to protect vulnerable populations from SEA. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Professor Freedman joined the University of Reading in September 2016 as Professor of Law, Conflict and Global Development, having previously been researching UN accountability in the context of the Haiti cholera crisis of 2010. Her work on the immunity of UN staff across different jurisdictions led to an invitation to speak at a workshop in 2016 organised by the NGO Keeping Children Safe, which was the start of an ongoing collaboration on this area. Their work on international child safeguarding standards led to her research on UN peacekeeper sexual exploitation and abuse \(SEA\), which entailed examining organisational governance and infrastructure and providing evidence\-based solutions. By examining the laws surrounding the immunity of international peacekeepers whilst on mission, and uncovering national and international laws and standards as applied to these situations, Freedman built a framework of questions and actions required by the multilevel stakeholders involved in in\-country missions, which was the first stage in creating a safeguarding toolkit. Using contacts from her work in Haiti and at the UN, Freedman and Keeping Children Safe began to build networks throughout the UN incorporating human rights lawyers, humanitarians, diplomats and UN staff and military personnel. This gave them access to UN discussions around peacekeeping missions, as well as access to missions themselves, enabling Freedman and KCS to carry out research and gather observations of on\-the\-ground action. Throughout the project Freedman has secured external funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council \(AHRC\), the British Academy \(BA\), and the Global Challenges Research Fund \(GCRF\), as well as more recently from the UK FCO, UNICEF and DFID. 

 The initial research in collaboration Keeping Children Safe \(funded by a BA Grant\) was conducted in Liberia, which has had a continuous UN Peacekeeper presence since 2001 and was keen to address SEA. Further research involved trips to locations including the UN mission in Haiti, peacekeeping training centres in Ghana and Sweden, and large troop\-contributing countries such as Brazil, Canada, Ethiopia, and Uruguay \(AHRC and BA grants\). The team examined the legacy of peacekeeping operations in\-country, and the separate policies protecting peacekeepers from prosecution and safeguarding children, whilst gathering field data and working with local stakeholders to understand the root causes of SEA. 

 During these trips, the team conducted observational research and interviews with key stakeholders, including senior UN personnel, NGOs and local civil society organisations undertaking safeguarding work. This led to a large\-scale doctrinal, desk and field investigation combining academic and practical methods across disciplines on the following issues and questions: 

-  Programmes and their impact on children – what risks are present? 

-  Policies and procedures needed to prevent harm – how are concerns responded to? 

-  Safe recruitment 

-  Safeguarding induction and training – what does an organisation expect from them and what should be done if concerns are raised? 

-  Organisation codes of conduct – what is and what is not acceptable behaviour? 

-  Who in the organisation manages concerns and investigations? 

-  What are the reporting and responding processes? 

 The findings now provide an evidence base for effective ways of safeguarding children and adults in peacekeeping contexts \[Section 3, refs 1,2,3\]. Freedman’s 2018 article in the *European Journal of International Law* \[ref 1\] is the first law article to explain the history of the different forms of immunity enjoyed by peacekeeping personnel, as well as the reasons behind them and the consequences they have. Taking a human\-rights\-based approach, it analyses how the current system and rules restrict people’s access to the courts and violate their right to see punitive action taken. Professor Freedman and Keeping Children Safe have gone on to devise a new innovative approach to child safeguarding, which has developed into a framework implementable by UN peacekeeper agencies, governments contributing troops to peacekeeping missions, international donors and high\-level UN officials \[ref 2\]. This toolkit, which emerged from the findings and framework, enables prevention, protection and safeguarding, specifically in relation to children and adults in peacekeeping contexts. It is designed to be adapted to local contexts, and involves five steps, characterised as \(1\) assessment of current policies and practices; \(2\) robust mapping of relevant local and international laws and practices on child safeguarding; \(3\) development of context\-specific policies, measures and procedures through organisational and legal mapping; \(4\) training; and \(5\) follow\-up. Evidence and analysis aimed at policymakers and civil society have been created in the form of project reports from field work \[refs 4,5,6\], as well as videos and talks for international audiences \[see Section 4 below\]. 

 This body of research underpinned a further project conducted by Freedman and KCS, and commissioned by DFID in 2019, which developed new safeguarding standards for DFID’s due diligence process for its global aid programme.

##  Research quality 

 This research was funded through a number of highly competitive, peer\-reviewed funding applications from across UK Research and Innovation and international funding streams from the UN. It was published in well\-established peer\-reviewed academic journals and monograph series, given its robust and coherent analytical critique of existing international policies and practices regarding UN safeguarding. As a result, the approach and findings are innovative, providing for the first time a framework to assess whether or not organisations effectively safeguard children and adults from SEA. The research findings and policy recommendations have been incorporated into the safeguarding regimes and protocols of the international relief efforts of global humanitarian and human rights monitoring organisations, the UN and the UK government. 
","
#  4. Details of the impact 

 ‘Every day, across all countries and levels of society, millions of girls and boys face the alarmingly common childhood experience of sexual abuse and exploitation’ \(UN Deputy Secretary\-General, 2018\). In order to hasten the ending of such atrocities, Freedman’s original work on UN peacekeepers in Brazil and in Liberia \[ref 4\], has underpinned changes in safeguarding policy in the military peacekeeping context globally \(Canada, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, Uruguay and the USA\). However, the reach and significance of the research goes even further. Since the Oxfam crisis in 2018, when findings of SEA by staff were exposed, Freedman has been an internationally recognised expert providing safeguarding advice and research\-informed training across UN agencies, national military forces, and government and NGO operations. This has resulted in the implementation of new policies across the world, meaning that organisations have processes in place to safeguard vulnerable citizens against SEA. 

##  New safeguarding policies implemented across international military forces 

 For the international military forces, Freedman’s research and safeguarding toolkit have shaped international policy on safeguarding against SEA in both UN peacekeeping activities and other military operations. There are currently over 99,000 UN personnel serving in 14 global peace missions across four continents, with uniformed personnel coming from 112 contributing nations; by its very nature, peacekeeping work is therefore happening in the most physically and politically difficult environments in the world, where the most vulnerable populations can be found. Adoption of the toolkit and policies has therefore ensured protection and enabled safeguarding from SEA by UN peacekeepers. Furthermore, it has provided a route to punitive action where SEA allegations are proven. 

 The toolkit has been adopted by \(inter\)national military forces and key international training centres for peacekeeping troops. This successful adoption has been contingent on Freedman’s work with each of these institutions to foster a mutual understanding of the challenges faced on the ground regarding impunity and other issues; this included analysing legal frameworks, mapping and assessing risk, developing safeguarding policies and processes for reporting, and managing allegations of abuse. The work has ensured that the toolkit is adapted for each context by the co\-development of policy for safeguarding via academic–practitioner collaboration and the sharing of best practice. The resultant toolkits have been adopted by the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre \[source 2\], situated in Ghana, a country recognised for five decades for its influence on peacekeeping in Africa, and the Folke Bernadotte Academy \[source 2\], which provides training for European contributing countries. 

 Furthermore, Freedman’s research and extensive engagement, through co\-designed workshops, with senior Uruguayan military forces, policymakers \(Ministry of Foreign Affairs\) and NGOs resulted in Uruguay becoming the first military in the world to adopt a child safeguarding policy. It also led to the establishment of the newly formed \(May 2019\) Uruguayan Peacekeeping Training Centre of Excellence on Safeguarding, which is funded by UNICEF and trains 107 troops each year \[source 2\]. In addition to its influence across Latin America as a whole, the Uruguayan military is now an exemplar for child safeguarding for all countries contributing UN troops deployed internationally, with trained investigators positioned in every battalion where Uruguayan troops are serving \[source 1\]. 

 In response to the deployment of UK Ministry of Defence service personnel to support the civil authorities in the context of the Covid\-19 pandemic across Latin America, Freedman and KCS provided a nine\-part webinar training series for over 400 serving personnel \[source 2\]. 

##  New safeguarding policies adopted across the UN and all of its agencies 

 Freedman’s research has underpinned standardised UN child safeguarding policies \[source 3\]; these are now being implemented across all UN agencies \(including the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the UN Refugee Agency\). This followed extensive engagement by Freedman and KCS on the implementation of the toolkit with the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti \(the UN Stabilization Mission\), along with the UN Police, UN agencies such as UN Population Fund \(UNFPA\) and UNICEF, and a variety of international NGOs \(Save the Children, Plan International, Oxfam\). 

 \[Text removed for publication\]. Furthermore, in September 2019, Freedman was invited to attend the UN Roundtable on SEA in Peace Operations, where she provided insight into accountability. Through these roles, Freedman has highlighted the need for standardised and evidence\-based solutions to SEA across UN facets, and secure senior\-level buy\-in on the use of the child safeguarding toolkit. 

 The research and analysis from this project have therefore been adopted and used in policymaking at the highest levels of the UN. Through the adoption and implementation of the toolkit, the new policies comprise a formalised process of protection and reporting, with consequences when failures occur. The UN’s changed approach to tackling sexual exploitation and abuse, focuses on putting victims first, ending impunity, engaging civil society and external partners, and improving strategic communications, both in order to educate and to increase transparency. 

##  Developed new SEA safeguarding standards for DIFD’s Due Diligence process for its aid programme 

 In 2019 Freedman was appointed as a specialist adviser on safeguarding to the UK government’s International Development Select Committee and part of an expert reference advisory group tasked with enhancing DFID policies aimed at fulfilling its commitment to delivering aid in a way which does no harm, protects the most vulnerable, deters wrongdoing and holds perpetrators to account \[source 5\]. This followed Freedman’s invited talk at the Safeguarding Summit in March 2018, and DFID’s Secretary of State’s announcement that DFID would introduce new, enhanced and specific safeguarding standards for UK Civil Society Organisations \(CSOs\). 

 In 2019 Freedman and KCS were commissioned by DFID’s newly created Safeguarding Unit to conduct safeguarding\-specific central assurance assessments on 31 CSOs, which account for over GBP2,000,000,000 of DIFD/UK Aid funding, and deliver programmes in more than 30 countries across Africa, Asia and the Middle East \[source 2\]. “Freedman’s research informed the development and implementation of \[this\] initiative” \[source 2\]. It therefore underpinned the development of due diligence systems for DIFD, and its partners, to use in assessing safeguarding \[source 2 and 4\]. It also informed the delivery of training for DFID country offices, programme manager and auditors, as well as the support provided for the 31 CSOs to improve their safeguarding measures \[source 2\]. 

 In summary, in creating a novel framework co\-designed with end users, Freedman’s research has underpinned the reform and development of policy and practice to address the global problem of sexual abuse and exploitation by the aid and peacekeeping sectors. This reform is long overdue, since previous episodic responses from the sectors were inadequate. The framework has been adopted by a global reach of the most influential organisations, including all NGOs funded by DFID, international military forces, the UN and all of its agencies. As a result, the scale of the impact is equalled by the significance. ‘The cumulative impact of this initiative has been to dramatically improve safeguarding measures in a significant number of global organisations impacting the lives of some of the most at\-risk people in the world…this means that fewer people will suffer exploitation and abuse, that survivors will have someone to turn to if abuse occurs, that it will be easier to bring perpetrators to justice, and that organisations that fail to act to protect the people they serve, can now be more easily held to account’ \[source 2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The award\-winning Courthouse Museum, opened at Shire Hall, Dorchester, in 2018, was curated by Dr Rose Wallis and based on her original research into regional courts of law as sites of social contest and reflections of social change. Shire Hall has national and international resonance as the site of the trial of the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1834. The setting up of the museum, drawing on Wallis’ research and collaboration with local trustees and museum professionals, has established a new centre for public engagement with the social function of criminal justice in the past and present. In its first year of opening, the museum attracted over 17,000 visitors. The dissemination and development of Wallis’ interpretative approach employed at Shire Hall has provided a framework for professional practice, forging new partnerships for collaborative working between academics and heritage practitioners, and has been used to inform the redevelopment plan for Bristol’s Victorian magistrates’ courts. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Historical research by Dr Rose Wallis has focused on criminal justice, local government, and the lived experience of these features of society amongst communities in the late\-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It has addressed calls for more concerted studies of the actions and attitudes of the authorities to social protest. In focusing on the courts as structures of government it has provided important new insights into the social relationships shaped by them. Wallis’ historical expertise underpinned and enabled her involvement with Shire Hall Courthouse Museum, which generated new historical research and practice\-led research; interrogating the interpretation of criminal justice histories in heritage contexts. 

 **Research in practice** 

 Wallis’ research has concentrated on regional courts of law and their function as both judicial and local governmental centres. Rather than seeing them as purely regulatory or controlling, her work has emphasised them as sites of social contest; places where people from all walks of life interacted and sought redress. Her published work on the prosecution of social protest has complicated representations of law as merely repressive, highlighting the importance of local and regional contexts in shaping popular action and responses to it \( **R1**\). Locally\-focused studies expose more clearly the social relationships that underpin local government and popular protest \( **R2**, **R3**\), nuancing our understanding of national events \( **R1, R2**\) and changes in the form and function of the criminal justice system \( **R3**\). The courts, from this perspective, shape and reflect social relationships, making their study vital to understanding societal change. 

 In March 2016, Wallis was invited to join the interpretation team at Dorset’s Shire Hall, to use her research to develop a new interpretation strategy for a courthouse museum. The Heritage Lottery Fund \(HLF\) had awarded Shire Hall GBP1,500,000 in 2015, match\-funded by West Dorset District Council, to renovate and redevelop the site as a centre for public engagement with criminal justice, social justice and human rights. 

 Initial interpretation plans for the new museum had been rejected by both Shire Hall’s trustees and the Lottery Fund. Focused on ‘rough justice’, the original strategy had emphasised narratives of repression and unproblematic progress in the development of our criminal justice system. Building on Wallis’ research, a new interpretation strategy was developed by Wallis with Anna Bright \(Managing Director\), Iona Keen \(Heritage Consultant\), and Jill Cook \(Trustee\). This was framed instead by the conception of the courts as a dynamic, social space and focused on researching the individual cases that came before the court at Shire Hall in order to inform and engage visitors with the history and social function of criminal justice. 

 New archival research conducted by Wallis and local volunteers was used to create the fixed interpretation and multi\-media guides, including a bespoke interactive family guide, at Shire Hall \( **R5**\). Cases concerning the treatment of young offenders, popular political activism, and social welfare, are presented to visitors; resonating with their own experiences, stimulating reflection and debate \( **R4, R5**\). 



 Figure 1: Shire Hall Historic Courthouse Museum 

 **Practice\-led research** 

 This new interpretative approach for Shire Hall drew on key elements of Wallis’ research and historiographical positioning, which had important implications for public engagement and the museum’s aims. Most people have little direct experience of the criminal justice system. A populist focus on the repressive function of the courts, or a generalized narrative of change, limits visitors’ critical engagement by distancing them from the complex lived experience of historical actors. These narratives negate discussion of why particular judicial and penal decisions were made, and limit critical reflection on the functions of criminal justice in the past and present \( **R4**\). Locally\-focused, archivally\-driven, interpretation has the scope to provide a more accurate and nuanced picture of the operation of the law \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\). It is also a means to engage visitors more effectively: by connecting them with the physical space in which these events occurred; by presenting accurate and un\-sensationalised evidence; and by choosing cases that were representative of ordinary peoples’ lived experience that are both relatable and relevant to contemporary society \( **R4**\). Collaborative work at Shire Hall, and additional comparative fieldwork at other sites of criminal justice undertaken by Wallis, underpinned her critical evaluation of the approach to interpretation adopted at Shire Hall \( **R4**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Professional impact at Shire Hall** 

 Shire Hall, Dorset’s courthouse between 1797 and 1955, was the site of the trial of the Tolpuddle Martyrs in 1834, in recognition of which the Trades Union Congress purchased the courtroom through a charitable trust in 1956. It became a site of pilgrimage, particularly for trade unionists, but lacked a curatorial or interpretative framework for the public at large. Wallis, as academic practitioner within the interpretation team, was instrumental in providing this framework for the courthouse museum at the heart of Shire Hall’s new public era. This framework directly shaped the exhibitions and the on\-going public engagement activities. According to its Managing Director, it was ‘ *thanks to Rose \[Wallis\] and her research that there is a Shire Hall historic courthouse museum*’ \( **S1**\). 

 The proposed museum’s interpretation strategy was presented to the Shire Hall board of trustees and adopted in September 2016 \( **S2**\). UWE\-directed archival research, led by Wallis and volunteers at Dorset History Centre, provided all the content for the museum. Wallis collaborated with digital media providers, writers and film makers to incorporate the research into the fixed and multi\-media interpretative displays and activities \( **R5**\). The same focus on archival evidence has been central to underpinning the museum’s learning programme \( **S1**\) **.** 

 Professional impact has been key to the project. Wallis has been actively involved in the training of volunteers, leading a series of workshops in March 2018 for approximately 80 volunteers prior to the museum’s opening, complemented by a written guide, as an introduction to the history of Shire Hall and criminal justice, and to the interpretative ethos and aims of the museum \( **S1**, **S3**\). In August 2018, Wallis facilitated another workshop to support volunteers engaged in archival research to refresh and support the historical content at Shire Hall and, in September 2020, a workshop to support the induction of new volunteers. 

 **Public impact at Shire Hall** 

 Public impact has been notable. In its first year of opening Shire Hall welcomed over 17,000 visitors. The research methodology was ‘ *instrumental’* in developing a ‘ *multi\-dimensional approach’* to the new interpretation strategy and the museum’s overarching theme: ‘ *Justice in the balance*’. Throughout the project, 

 *‘\[Wallis\] was instrumental in ensuring not only historical accuracy but also that the narrative linked back to our key messages, project aims and vision for Shire Hall’* \( **S4**\). 

 Combining archival research with a dialogic understanding of visitor engagement has been at the heart of this strategy, seeking to encourage critical reflection on the operation and social function of criminal justice past and present \( **S2**\). The archival research has proved a vital part of the visitor experience; 97% of survey respondents confirmed real lived experiences had enriched their visit, making it ‘ *more lifelike’ and ‘authentic’,* it *‘\[b\]rings the building to life. It puts history into a personal perspective.*’ 70% of respondents stated that it had made them think differently about the role of law in their lives, offering critical reflections on the apparent improvements in criminal justice. It also demonstrated ‘ *how important it is that the reasons behind what caused people to commit crime are looked into’,* that *‘mistakes are still made*’ and the need ‘ *even in the future to respect all people in society’* \( **S5**\). The museum is ‘ *changing people’s perceptions of the criminal justice system’* \( **S1**\). 

 In its first year of opening, Shire Hall was awarded Silver for Access and Inclusivity, and Gold for Tourism Innovation at the Dorset Tourism Awards \(2018\). At the Tourism Excellence Awards for the South West region, the museum was highly commended again for Access and Inclusivity and received a Silver award for Tourism Innovation. In 2019, Shire Hall was a national finalist in the Association for Heritage Interpretation Discover Heritage Awards, where the judges noted that: 

 *‘The interpretation offers a clear story about the Shire Hall and 'justice in the balance', allowing visitors to compare and reflect upon similar issues raised today. The chosen media engage visitors with particular physical, sensory and intellectual needs’* \( **S6**\). 

 The museum won Bronze at the Visit England Awards for Excellence 2020. *The Guardian* praised Shire Hall’s ‘ *clever curation and excellent interactive guides’* that ‘ *will entertain visitors of all ages’* \( **S7**\). 

 **Supporting the museum through the Covid\-19 pandemic** 

 Since Spring 2020, Wallis has worked with Shire Hall’s learning manager to redevelop elements of the museum’s interpretation to make it ‘Covid\-secure’ and facilitate reopening \( **S1**\). The Managing Director recognised how integral Wallis has become to the museum, ‘ *helping out with a second ‘new’ interpretation and restructure once Covid struck’*, and she since been made a trustee. Moreover, it was felt that: 

 *‘the interpretation work that \[Wallis\] has done could form the blueprint for similar such collaborations with museums of all sizes across the country’* \( **S1**\). 

 **Extending the interpretative approach beyond Shire Hall** 

 Extending the interpretation model employed at Shire Hall has been centred on supporting redevelopment of Bristol’s old magistrates’ courts. The National Lottery Heritage Fund \(NLHF\) reviewers of a successful GBP4,250,000 bid to redevelop the courts \(collaboratively with the Bristol\-based charity, Creative Youth Network \(CYN\)\) commended Wallis’ vital ‘ *robust heritage interpretation strategy’* which was central to the proposal and which NLHF had identified as missing from CYN’s initial proposals \( **S8**\). 

 This strategy not only offers public access to the history of the courts, but helps facilitate new use of the building as a creative enterprise centre specifically for young people from disadvantaged or marginalised backgrounds. Emphasising past and present connections, the interpretation strategy supports public engagement with the work of CYN by considering the social function of public buildings and spaces and the treatment of young people: 

 *‘\[Wallis\] continues to play an important role in overseeing how our heritage interpretation strategy works in practice, something which will be key in our work with young people and their understanding of history’* \( **S8**\). 

 Wallis’ critical evaluation of the approach employed at Shire Hall has been used to inform interpretative practice more broadly. In February 2020, Wallis facilitated an interdisciplinary collaborative workshop. This brought together heritage professionals from Ripon Museum Trust, the Museum of London, and the National Justice Museum, as well as academic colleagues in Law, Criminology, Social and Public History, and Heritage Tourism, to share and evaluate approaches to interpretation and audience engagement. The discussions were used by Wallis to produce a manifesto for effective and ethical interpretation of criminal justice histories \( **S9**\). 

 The Senior Curator and Archivist at the National Justice Museum explained the value of the workshop and manifesto: 

 *‘It helped us to re\-examine our Display Policy and to be more explicit in how we interpret different groups and their lived experiences of the criminal justice system in a more empathic way*.’ The manifesto provides ‘ *the starting point of laying down the basis of best practice for museums and heritage sites.’* Most crucially, it will be used to ‘ *forge new partnerships for collaborative working between academics and heritage practitioners on projects’* \( **S10**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Parr’s ground\-breaking, multi\-award\-winning research into contemporary soldiers and the legacies of war, published in the monograph, *Our Boys: The Story of a Paratrooper,* achieved exceptional reach. This is evidenced by its reception in the press and amongst readers, and by multiple invitations for Parr to address diverse audiences. Her research brought deep impact to former soldiers, improving their wellbeing and mitigating personal harms. It changed the views of non\-military readers about the nature of military life and combat, and it impacted current military training by shaping Army commanders’ understanding of relationships between military training, identity and trauma. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Helen Parr carried out the underpinning research from 2012 to 2018. She conducted extensive archival work and in\-depth interviews with many paratroopers who fought in the Falklands War, and with family members of soldiers who died.  Parr also used source material and interviews to interrogate the death of her uncle, a Private in the Parachute Regiment, and her own family’s’ responses to it. She was attentive to the writing up of the research, the mood and tone of the language in which her book was written. One of her book’s major achievements was to translate military experiences into words understood by former combatants as well as by wider publics. 

 Parr’s research sought to understand the human stories of men from an elite infantry regiment who fought in the Falklands, and those of their family members, while placing those stories into wider historical contexts. This determination to put the participants at the centre of their own stories – to see history through their eyes – while reconstructing the settings of the experiences, led to work that was rich in emotional detail and attuned to individuals’ experiences. The research aimed to understand the social and military contexts within which participants lived. This helped readers \(including participants\) to identify with the personal accounts relayed in the book. 

 This original, empathetic approach enabled Parr to expose the emotional depth of combat experience, trauma and grief. It illustrated the ongoing, but changing, nature of memories for ex\-combatants and for bereaved relatives. She argued that masculine and military identities were central to soldiers’ experience of combat, and suggests this should receive wider public recognition. Yet she also sees military identity as a complex professional identity framing many of the difficulties individuals face after combat. Her work has been praised for bringing the interior complexities of military life into the public domain. Reviewing Parr’s book in The *Spectator*, novelist Rachel Seiffert said it was: ‘a history that is important to understand as so few people have personal experience of military service’ \(5.1\). 

 Summary of research insights: 

1.  To illuminate, and capture accurately, the intensity of combat experiences for these elite soldiers. 

1.  To highlight the emotional depth and ongoing nature of memories of combat for many former soldiers, and their families. To focus on the experiences of grief, and post\-combat trauma, in their historical settings. 

1.  To analyse the construction during military training of masculine, soldierly, regimental identities, and to assess how those identities framed soldiers’ experiences of combat and the aftermath of war. 

1.  To illustrate the importance to individuals and institutions of relationships between Army and society, namely, the social backgrounds of recruits and how these mapped onto the hierarchies in the Parachute Regiment, also, the relationships between military families, a non\-military public and the armed services. 

1.  To emphasise key issues in the remembrance of contemporary war, and to indicate how greater societal attention to families, individual soldiers, and to personal pain has altered how Britons commemorate soldiers and war.

###  3. References to the research \(indicative maximum of six references\) 

 **Outputs** 

 Parr’s work was published as one, high profile monograph in September 2018. She opted to publish in this way to maximise the reach of the work, and because the research insights had most effect when brought together, rather than separated into different themes. Bringing the research insights together in this way enabled the creative, original, in\-depth approach of the book. 

 *Our Boys: The Story of a Paratrooper* \(Allen Lane, 2018\) – Hardback published 6 September 2018 

 Paperback published 6 June 2019, and Audible Audiobook, 10 October 2019. 

 **Funding** 

 Parr’s work was initially funded by a British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Grant that enabled much of the interview and some of the archival research. 

 2012: British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Grant, no.SG120253, ‘The Falklands War 1982 and its aftermath’, £9,604 

 Subsequently, and as a mark of the reach of the work, Parr was awarded an AHRC collaborative doctoral partnership for a PhD student jointly with the Imperial War Museum: 

 2018: ‘Surviving modern war: The experiences of British service personnel during the Falklands conflict 1982’, AHRC funded collaborative doctoral partnership, £56,000 

 **Evidence of quality of the research** 

 The quality of the research is evident as Parr won three national book prizes: the Templer Medal Book Prize \(April 2019\), the Duke of Wellington Medal for Military History, administered by the Royal United Services Institute \(June 2019\), and the Longman\-History Today Book Prize \(June 2019\). The book was also longlisted for the Orwell Prize for Political Writing \(June 2019\). \(5.3\). 

 On publication, the hardback monograph received exceptional media coverage. Parr’s book was reviewed prominently throughout the national press. It was lead review in four national newspapers \(the *Guardian*, the *Evening Standard*, the *Spectator*, the *Times Higher*\) and was subject of a feature in the *Observer* and an article in the *Telegraph* \(5.1\). The book was also listed as one of ten biggest reads of the Autumn 2018 in the *Guardian*. Guardian journalist Ian Jack named it as one of his cultural highlights of the year, and Boyd Tonkin \(former judge of the Man Booker Prize\) listed it as one of his books of the year on the website Artsdesk. It was a book of the year in the *Times Literary Supplement* in 2018, and Lord Jonathan Sumption listed it as one of his books of the year in the *Spectator* in 2019.  Parr was invited onto Radio 4’s flagship cultural programme Start the Week, and her book was Book of the Day in the *Guardian*, the *London Evening Standard,* the *Spectator* and Book of the Week in the *Times Higher*. \(5.1, 5.8\). 

 Sales of the book led many people \(c.60\-70 unsolicited correspondents\) to contact Parr directly, to leave spontaneous reviews on Amazon \(100 ratings and 43 reviews to date; 8 reviews and 62 ratings on goodreads\), and to Parr receiving invitations to speak to public and military audiences \(24 talks in 16 months; 6 radio and podcast interviews\). Many reviewers praised Parr’s writing and noted the originality of the work: ‘her book is deeply researched, but her approach to military history is also highly original’ \(Anthony Lloyd, The *Times*\). Many former military personnel have remarked on how accurately she has captured their feelings. Chair of the Foreign and Defence Parliamentary Select Committee, and former Army officer, Tom Tugendhat MP said the book: ‘opens up a world foreign to most… reveals many truths about the British Army that are essential to understanding our armed services’ \(5.1\). 
","
###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research: 

1.  Brought deep and sometimes painful self\-recognition to former and current soldiers, by expressing their experiences of combat and its aftermath: ‘you have explained us to ourselves’. This enhanced well\-being and mitigated potential harms to them. \(5.4; 5.9\) 

1.  Impacted current training by bringing deeper understanding to British Army commanders of links between military training, identity and trauma, and of the aftermaths of combat \(5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.10\) 

1.  Brought to public audiences an understanding of military life and combat experiences normally hidden from public view and poorly understood \(5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5\) 

 **Impact on understanding and well\-being of former soldiers** 

 c.40\-50 former soldiers contacted Parr to express gratitude at the recognition her book granted them of their own lives. KHY said ‘I found it very helpful and you answered questions about my own thoughts, feelings and behaviours’ \(5.4\). KC said the recognition he felt on reading the book gave him ‘a feeling of great relief’ \(5.4\). Parr’s work gave routes to understand their own masculine and soldierly identities, and thereby offered paths towards quite profound, intimate healing. JY said ‘you made me look at the war in a different light, made me question how I have handled the consequences’ \(5.4\).  MB wrote to Parr about feeling he would die, his loneliness and the suicides of his friends. He said, ‘But I have a little girl, who I love dearly and I will have to live until she graduates. I suppose what I am trying to say is Thanks, for remembering us’ \(5.4\). KRF said Parr’s research helped his youngest daughter ‘better to understand who I am and therefore who she is’. He said it helped him to ‘let go of things he should never have had hold of in the first place’. \(5.4\) An Argentine veteran said Parr’s research made him see that British veterans ‘are just the same as me’ \(5.9\). 

 **Impact on practitioners** 

 Parr’s research deepened current military commanders’ understandings of the relationships between military identity and combat trauma; and the responsibilities regiments have towards the relatives of the soldiers they deploy \(5.6, 5.10\). A current serving officer said Parr’s research made him reflect on his own experience of ‘losing soldiers under circumstances of being in the wrong place at the wrong time’ \(5.9\). Parr’s book is now mandatory reading for officers in training at Sandhurst destined for the Parachute Regiment. The most senior person in the Parachute Regiment, Colonel Commandant General Sir John Lorimer, said it is ‘the first book to try and succeed to get under the skin of the Parachute Regiment soldier’. Reading it will impact the ‘future platoon commanders’ understand\[ing\] of the soldiers under \[their\] command’ \(5.7\).  The current Commanding Officer of the Second Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, said Parr’s work influenced his understanding of potential links between the inculcation of soldierly identity in training and later reluctance to seek support for stress or depression; and that Parr’s research ‘compelled us carefully to consider our actions and decisions when placing paratroopers in harm’s way’ \(5.6\). The Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, said that Parr’s research had prompted much discussion amongst his officers about ‘how we train for the next conflict… a legacy indeed’ \(5.10\). 

 **Impact on understanding and well\-being amongst members of the public** 

 Parr’s research impacted members of the public by bringing attention to military experiences and changing people’s views as to their nature and meanings. One Amazon reviewer said she saw for the first time the social backgrounds of the men who joined the army: ‘we learn so much about the army, the para regiment, the people who served within it \- and the people who love or loved them’. \(5.2\) Other respondents writing spontaneously to Parr said it changed their views of the army, and war. It led them to question how war is traditionally commemorated: ‘helped me to see how memory speaks to who we are’ \(5.9, 5.5\). They understood better why young men might join the army, and, often, the book gave them greater empathy for soldiers \(5.5, 5.9\). Parr’s writing about universal emotions such as grief also impacted people and contributed to their own well\-being. SM said Parr’s book helped him come to terms with his father’s death by making him better understand his mother’s feelings \(5.5\). The emotional power of the research, and therefore its potential for deep impact, is plain from the number of reviewers commenting that they cried while reading it \(5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.9\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Working collaboratively with the Ceredigion Youth Justice and Prevention Services \(CYJPS\), Dr Norris developed a bespoke risk assessment tool \(CYSTEM\) which changed the practice of assessment for young people referred across the four Dyfed\-Powys Youth Offending Teams. CYSTEM enabled the diversion of over a third of low\-risk offenders from formal criminal justice involvement; and for resources to be targeted at higher risk individuals who were most likely to benefit from targeted interventions. Alongside the impact on individual local stakeholders, the expertise generated informed policy for the Youth Justice Service \(YJS\), Police, Youth Justice Board \(YJB\), and the Home Office both in the UK and overseas. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 An analysis of the declining crime rates since 2005 by Griffith and Norris \[3.1\], identified that an overall reduction in the number of offenders over the 2005 to 2015 period is closely linked to a significant reduction \(45%\) in the proportion of the youth population that offends in any given year. In addition, the number of youth offenders appeared to have contributed to a ‘knock on’ effect on the number of adults offending in subsequent years. In essence, this is the outcome of young people not offending \[when young\], who subsequently did not go on to offend as adults. This analysis highlighted the importance of various policy initiatives designed to address youth crime and anti\-social behaviour, such as the National Strategy for the Policing of Children and Young People and a move towards welfare\-based approaches for lower\-level youth offending. 

 To this end, through a funded collaboration with Ceredigion Youth Justice Practice Services \(CYJPS\) \[3.6\], a risk assessment tool \- the Ceredigion Youth Screening Tool \(CYSTEM\) \- was designed and implemented in 2016, to take a pragmatic approach to the diversion of young people out of the formal Youth Justice system. 

 This screening tool addresses the two linked factors of risk of offending \(ROF\) and risk of vulnerability \(ROV\). It is a *pre\-screen* tool to reduce both the administrative burden and the potential for stigmatisation of the young people being referred \(‘Child First’ approach\) to the Youth Justice system. The tool was initially informed largely by reference to existing practice inventories \(predominantly ASSET\), but with significant input from case managers and senior assessment staff. CYSTEM assesses six core facets identified as predictors of later offending: ROF: Criminal/ antisocial thoughts; Criminal/ antisocial environment; Criminal/ antisocial behaviour; ROV: Looked after child/ child in need/ social service/ disability; Living with perpetrator of DV and/ or sexual exploitation; Reckless/ harmful behaviour \(inc. sexual\). The presence of one of these features during screening necessitates a formal ASSET assessment; for those identified as very low risk \(i.e., not scoring on any of the key indicators\), then no formal intervention is enacted. Sensitivity analysis \(AUC\) indicated that there was a moderate level of predictive capacity in being able to identify the likely future offenders from the non\-offenders. In this domain, the screening tool showed comparable discriminant validity as similar tools. \[3.2\] 

 Following the development of CYSTEM, the Home Office funded two phases of targeted intervention with CYJPS with Norris as programme evaluator\- SOC\-1 and SOC\-2 \[3.7\]. The Risk\-Needs\-Responsivity \(RNR\) model\- a process well established in the correctional literature, that advocates the allocation of individuals to appropriate interventions based on their individual circumstances and requirements\- demonstrates that medium to high\-risk offenders, are significantly more responsive to high quality intervention work, than most low\-risk offenders \[3.3\]. Utilising the CYSTEM tool, cohorts of high\-risk young offenders were identified as suitable referrals to undertake a range of interventions designed to address issues of vulnerability to exploitation and Serious and Organized Crime \(SOC\) activities, including sexual exploitation and drug supply networks, ‘County Lines’. The interventions consisted of 6 weeks of structured activities that covered topics including web safety, mood and emotions, and substance misuse. The impact of these interventions was measured through a decrease in offending frequency, intensity and reduction in risk profiles, alongside psychological indices including well\-being and resilience \[3.4; 3.5\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words 

 CYSTEM, has been used by CYJPS since April 2016. Following directives from the Police and Crime Commissioner \(PCC\) for Dyfed\-Powys, from April 2018, the screening tool was further adopted for use with all referrals to the Youth Justice Service \(YJS\) across the Dyfed\-Powys force area \-  Pembrokeshire, Carmarthen, Powys and Ceredigion \[5.1; 5.2\] \- to ensure: a\) a valid screening process for referrals as identified through HM Probation Youth Offending Team \(YOT\) inspections, and b\) a standardised force\-wide process to facilitate data sharing and research. The risk\-assessment tool informs decision making on the most appropriate level of involvement following referrals to the YJS and is able to screen out approximately 35% of the entire case load referred to CYJPS, depending on whether an individual is identified as either a low\-risk, or high\-risk young offender \[5.3; 3.2\]. 

 The key beneficiaries are threefold. Firstly, adopting a ‘Child First’ approach has been applied towards **Young People in Ceredigion and Dyfed\-Powys** reducing the stigmatisation/ labelling of the young people referred to the service; this further reduces the chances of later offending for these low\-risk offenders. The number of referrals in Ceredigion was reduced by approximately 30% in terms of total case load. The Head of CYJPS confirms: 

 The development of the Ceredigion Youth Screening Tool \(CYSTEM\) has been a major driver of change in the way in which we assess and process young people referred to the service. CYSTEM has allowed us to focus resources on the most critical individuals and avoid stigmatizing the very low risk cases; figures show that this has had an impact on the number of young people re\-entering the system over the past two years. \[5.1\] 

 Secondly, **staff working in Youth Justice** saved time and financial resources **,** which enabled more efficient allocation of intervention work such as group work, sports\-based interventions, one\-to\-one supervision, and substance misuse programmes. Using CYSTEM for a third of cases saves between three and five hours per referral and between approximately 150 and 200 hours per year, per caseworker. Not having to formally assess very low risk young offenders has significantly reduced demand for resources and freed up case workers’ time to provide intervention work with the high\-risk category. The Head of CYJPS confirms: 

 The tool has changed the practices of referrals by screening out low risk individuals and has since been adopted across the four Dyfed\-Powys force areas. Beyond the benefits realized by the young people, CYSTEM has saved hundreds of hours in staff time and released vital resources for important work in the community. \[5.1\] 

 Thirdly, the **wider public benefited through crime reduction,** by enabling resources to be targeted at medium to high risk offenders, the group which have been demonstrated in showing the greatest improvement from high quality intervention work, as identified by a Home Office SOC Policy Advisor in relation to the SOC Evaluation reports \[3.4; 3.5\]: ‘\[t\]he evaluations demonstrate a positive impact on the lives of these young people…that demonstrate how to change the life trajectories of many very vulnerable young people’ \[5.4\]. 

 The UK Minister for National Security and Economic Crime referred to the Ceredigion SOC\-2 project at a briefing for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners \(APCC\), 9 May 2019 \[5.4\]. The briefing, interventions project, and Dr Norris’ evaluation work were also cited in a Home Office press release, 13 May 2019: 

 A project that the Home Office and Ceredigion Youth Justice and Prevention Service funds is helping around 30 young people by giving them an opportunity to recognise the consequences of becoming involved in serious and organised crime, and to learn to recognise high risk situations and practice ways of responding. \[5.5\] 

 The work also featured in the Home Office SOC Local Partnerships Bulletin in August 2019 \[5.6\]. The SOC project was nominated for a Howard League Community Award in 2018 and 2019 \[5.7\]. 

 For the Head of CYJPS: ‘Dr Norris' evaluations for the two Home Office projects have been pivotal in furthering our understanding of the way in which Serious and Organized Crime \(SOC\) manifests itself amongst the most vulnerable young people in Ceredigion’ \[5.1\]. As such, the Dyfed\-Powys PCC has awarded funding for the CJYPS to continue using the intervention work utilised within these projects \[5.2\]. Dr Norris has an on\-going role in the design and evaluation of this continuation of the SOC project though funding secured from the Serious Youth Violence fund, delivering targeted interventions based on CYSTEM profiles \[5.1; 5.2\]. Approximately 100 young people have been provided opportunities through these targeted interventions. \(Project on\-hold due to Covid\-19\). 

 The approach advocated by Ceredigion Prevention Services is being formalised as a model for Welsh Government providing a template for youth justice practice across Wales \[5.8.a\]. Following the success of the Ceredigion model, the Youth Justice Board \(YJB\) awarded GBP30,000 in funding to formalise the approach into a proposed model for Youth Justice across Wales. Dr Norris will be a consultant in this project and deliver a revised version of CYSTEM \[5.8.b; 5.8.c\)\]. \(Delayed due to Covid\-19\). 

 As a continuation of Dr Norris’ work within Youth Justice, he has also informed the Home Office’s development and testing of a UK Prevent Intervention Toolkit aimed at practitioners working with people at risk of, or involved in, SOC \[5.9\]. A Home Office Policy Officer confirms, ‘Dr Norris provided expert input in relation to delivering programmes with young people, vulnerability and assessment of risk. We are grateful for his time, case studies and documents he provided on the CYSTEM screening tool and the SOC checklist used in the Ceredigion interventions, elements of which were cited in the toolkit *’* \[5.9\]. Dr Norris also contributed to South Wales Police Violence and Vulnerability Unit’s work, developing a strategic framework for tackling serious violence in Wales \[5.10\]. 

 A “SOC Workbook” was developed for use by YOT’s and ancillary organisations for SOC intervention work \[5.11\]. The workbook includes material on risk\-assessment, including CYSTEM and a SOC Checklist developed by Norris, and is used in the on\-going SOC preventions work funded by the PCC. A dedicated ‘Preventions’ web\-portal hosts the workbook, project details and information on local and national preventions work \[5.11\]. 

 Dr Norris was also invited to work as a consultant with the Home Office ‘Prevent’ programme to design and deliver educational programmes for young people as part of a three\-year intervention on SOC in Albania \[5.12\]. A Home Office Policy Advisor confirms: \`The work has provided the Home Office with a valuable insight into the nature of SOC vulnerability…which will be used further afield as part of the Prevent programme in the UK as well as for our work on Prevent upstream programme internationally’ \[5.4\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Dr Liz Gloyn’s research on the philosophy of Seneca the Younger has directly informed how school teachers have taught this topic at A Level. She has produced learning resources – both textual and video – drawing on her research that have shaped the way teachers have approached and delivered the topic. Students have reported \(via teachers\) how beneficial they found Gloyn’s resources, often citing them in written work. Teachers have reported that her research and resources have strengthened their knowledge of Seneca which enhanced their approach to teaching of Roman Stoicism. Gloyn’s research has also informed wider public understanding of Seneca’s philosophy via public philosophy and talks addressed to non\-academic audiences. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Gloyn’s research has drawn on a combination of social, cultural, and historical analyses to provide an innovative philosophical perspective on Roman Stoicism, in particular the ethics of Seneca the Younger. The centrepiece of this research is a Cambridge University Press monograph offering the first extensive account of Seneca’s teachings on the family \(R1\). It makes significant contributions to academic appreciation of Seneca’s thought by using his views on the role of the family and familial relations as an introduction to his wider philosophy. Gloyn argues for the centrality of the family in his thinking about moral development and uses the lens of the ethics of the family to provide an account of the way in which abstract philosophical reasoning and “everyday” practical advice are integrated in Seneca’s writings. This research thereby overcomes the problematic distinction between his philosophical and non\-philosophical works. 

 Gloyn has also this integrated approach to Seneca’s work in a study of his treatise *De Consolatione ad Polybium* \(R2\). Whilst Seneca is advising Polybius on how to overcome his grief at the death of his brother, he is also illustrating and applying the Stoic framework of the pursuit of virtue and of reason within his prescriptions for relationships within the family and within society. 

 The treatment of the family is similarly the topic used to illuminate Seneca’s philosophy in Gloyn’s analysis of his collection of letters, the *Epistulae Morales* \(R3\). Gloyn has examined how Seneca applies ethical principles, such as seeing the interests of others as one’s own, to the complex real\-world situation of life in a Roman household. Going further, she presents an argument that his ideas and ideals pertaining to families may be seen as the organising principle for this entire collection of his writings. 

  

 In research published in 2020 as part of an interdisciplinary collection of essays \(R4\), Gloyn explored the relationship between fatherhood and leadership. Seneca uses the concept of *clementia* or clemency as a way to articulate the kinds of care that the emperor Nero might show towards his subjects, using the father\-son relationship to draw out how the more a leader exercises *clementia*, the more he will enable care – and the more he enables care, the more successfully he will exercise *clementia*.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>Supporting Teachers via Resources</ins> 

 Dr Gloyn’s research has supported teachers addressing the work of the philosopher Seneca as part of the OCR A Level in Classical Civilization. When the OCR introduced a section asking students to explore the views of the philosopher Seneca on love and relationships, teachers found themselves confronting a new topic they had not taught before. In need of support, members of the subject community independently identified Gloyn as an expert on the topic and they made contact \(S9\). She assisted in the detailed development of the curriculum, produced supporting resources, and provided advice on how to teach the unit on Seneca within the A Level. In terms of engagement with this module, \[text removed for publication\] \(S5\). Since 2018 Gloyn has given seven talks to pupils and/or teachers on Seneca’s thought, recorded a series of 6 video lectures for teachers on MASSOLIT \(an online platform providing short video lectures in the arts, humanities and social sciences for secondary schools\), and continuously updated her blog *Classically Inclined* with freely accessible resources for teachers. 

 In line with the DoE’s guidance, students preparing for the A Level are expected to study Seneca’s concepts of relationships directly from his own writings. However, the relevant passages are scattered across multiple works, rendering it difficult for teachers to identify and provide access to suitable readings. The syllabus also requires students to pay critical attention to scholarship on Seneca but again does not offer guidance on how to access and engage with such scholarship. Gloyn’s 2017 monograph offers one of the few extended scholarly discussions of the required topics of love, relationships, and desire in Seneca. In dialogue with the teaching community, Gloyn wrote over a dozen targeted topic summaries on her blog \( *Classically Inclined*, S7\) designed to support teachers in their preparation of lessons: i\) a collection of translations of the known fragments of Seneca’s *De Matrimonio* that is otherwise unavailable; ii\) accessible summaries of relevant key ideas of Stoic thought; iii\) overviews of different scholarly approaches. The blog posts have been read over 9,490 times since the first was published in 2018, the most popular post being the suggested primary sources, with approximately 2,380 views. Caroline Bristow, Director of the Cambridge School Classics Project who worked at OCR at the time, has described Gloyn’s resources as ‘invaluable to teachers’ \(S6\). She also noted that ‘The new requirement for students to make use of scholarship in their longer essays caused great stress, and many teachers cite this blog series and Dr. Gloyn’s other work as incredibly useful and accessible for them and their students. I run the OCR training for teachers of Classical Civilisation and I point to Dr. Gloyn’s work as an excellent resource at almost every session.’ Similarly \[text removed for publication\] \(S9\). 

 <ins>Contributing to Teachers’ Professional Development</ins> 

 As part of shaping the delivery of the OCR curriculum, Gloyn spoke at a Classical Association Teaching Board \(CATB\) training day for teachers of A Level Classical Civilization in 2019. The aim of the day was to enhance the knowledge of teachers on the different areas of the new syllabus and to provide support to teachers to help them to ‘upskill themselves not only in terms of their knowledge of the ancient sources and context, but in terms of a wealth of scholarly material as well’ \(S1\). Unfortunately, the textbooks commissioned and produced by OCR did not include appropriate recommendations for further study. Given this lacuna, Rob Hancock\-Jones, Head of Classical Civilization at Townley Grammar School who convened the CATB training day, invited Gloyn to speak because she had already published ‘very useful resources for the Love & Relationships module on her blog, and as such she was requested as a speaker from multiple members of the Classics teaching community’ \(S1\). The event attracted over 100 teachers \(each with an average of 16 students per year\), of whom more than 20 took part in Gloyn’s session with many of the day’s feedback comments referring to the usefulness of her talk. Since the training day, Rob Hancock\-Jones has ‘certainly noticed in the online Classics teacher communities that there is now much less frequent and less intense concern over the scholarship requirement in A Level Classical Civilisation. Part of this, I like to think, is down to the assistance given by Liz and others at the CATB event’ \(S1\). 

 Following her contribution to the content and delivery of this part of the curriculum, Gloyn has continued to support teachers as well as students in person through invited talks at schools, including Beaconsfield High School, Camden School for Girls, Chigwell School, Eltham College, and the Jewish Community Secondary School in London. Chris Lord, Head of Classics at Chigwell School stressed that ‘the way she ran the seminar really engaged our students and raised the level of both our discussion and subject knowledge. I also felt much more confident teaching this part of the course’ \(S1\). These talks also encouraged teachers to discover other resources provided by Gloyn including her blog \(S1 and S2\). 

 Teachers have used Gloyn’s translations and passage selections to introduce pupils to Seneca’s principles and her blog posts have not only been assigned to students as set reading but used by the teachers themselves to develop their confidence and competence in delivering this topic. This is demonstrated by testimonials referring to Gloyn’s support as ‘invaluable’ in alleviating their fear of teaching philosophy and instead providing confidence \(S1 and S2\). In many cases, they refer to Gloyn’s blog *Classically Inclined*, which has been a key source of information for them, such as where to find Seneca’s philosophy that we should enter marriage even though we cannot guarantee perfect outcomes \(S7\). Responses to Gloyn’s tweets have also demonstrated the reach of her work – such as ‘An invaluable teaching resource for OCR Class Civ A Level’ and ‘Preparing to teach Seneca's view on Love and Relationships to students, and @lizgloyn’s brilliant blog is proving SO useful’ \(S7\). Furthermore, James Miller, the Head of Department of Classics and Philosophy at Durham Sixth Form Centre stated ‘when I have gone into other centres to help them with aspects of this A Level I have directed them to the blog too. It is no exaggeration to say that our teaching of this part of the module is built around Dr Gloyn’s work’ \(S2\). 

 The Classics Library, a website to support teachers that has 2688 active members, includes a number of resources developed by Gloyn and it links to Gloyn’s blog \(S5\). There are \[text removed for publication\] of the *Love and Relationships* discussion group, in which teachers share resources. \[text removed for publication\] \(S5\). Quotes from teachers using The Classics Library include \[text removed for publication\] \(S5\). 

 <ins>Transforming Student Understanding</ins> 

 Alongside events and resources aimed at supporting teachers, Gloyn has also produced material more directly targeted at students, as well as speaking at events such as Sovereign Education’s topic study day on the Seneca A Level unit. In particular, Gloyn has created a number of videos for students in two Seneca based courses hosted on the MASSOLIT learning platform, which provides short video lectures in the arts, humanities and social sciences for secondary schools. This includes six videos on ‘Seneca’s letters’ \(S8\). Since August 2018, the videos have been watched 4,294 times \(S4\). The founder of MASSOLIT, Chris Tudor, explained that Gloyn was commissioned to produce these courses due to her 2017 book, her blog, and because she was accessible by being ‘active on Twitter’ \(S4\). He also affirmed the significance of the courses to users: ‘The course on Love and Relationships was particularly useful as it covered a particularly difficult section of the specification. ‘Difficult’ because Seneca is inherently difficult, plus the specification was remarkably indeterminate on what parts of Seneca students should concentrate on’ \(S4\). 

 Students’ responses to the resources and talks by Gloyn have been highly positive. Her talks have been described by students as ‘inspirational’ \(S7\) and ‘engaging’ \(S1\) ways to connect with and understand better potentially challenging material. Students have also actively engaged with Gloyn’s targeted topic summaries when teachers have asked them ‘to read them for homework and then discuss the ideas covered in class’ \(S2\). This has encouraged an interest in the philosophy of Seneca and other philosophers for further study: ‘\[the blog\] encouraged two of my students to go on to study Philosophy at university … we have five of the sixteen students who are continuing with Classical subjects at university. They are most keen to know what type of research the academics that are going to be teaching them are undertaking’ \(S2\). Students have also utilised Gloyn’s blog to integrate into other parts of their education: ‘One of my students used some of the ideas she had studied in Love and Relationships, including Seneca, in her English coursework. Another student is now studying Classics at university. As part of her contribution to the school’s Classical Society, she explained some of Seneca’s views to younger students in the school. Again, the blog played an important role here’ \(S2\). Another example of the impact of Gloyn’s work beyond Classics classwork comes from Claire Brice, Head of Classics at Bedford Girl’s School, who records ’One student emailed me during the lockdown period to say that she was so glad we had studied Seneca and that she was really into Seneca’s Stoicism now in a personal way’ \(S2\). 

 Further evidence of the impact upon students is the examiner’s report \(S6\), providing figures for students opting to answer the Seneca exam questions and describing where students have referred to Gloyn as part of their answer. Jenny Jones, a former teacher at Burgess Hill Girls School explained that ‘the blog was essential for their exploration of friendship, which later appeared as an examination question, in terms of both material and ideas’ \(S2\). This demonstrates both that students are confident to answer questions on Seneca, and that Gloyn’s work is of key significance in this area and thus students feel it is important to reference her in relation to Seneca’s philosophy. 

 <ins>Contributing to Public Understanding</ins> 

 Beyond UK schools and universities, Gloyn’s research on the philosophy of Seneca has impacted upon wider understanding of Seneca’s philosophy, Stoicism, about how Stoicism might be beneficial for people today. Professor Massimo Pigliucci, Chair of the Department of Philosophy at the City College of New York, immediately saw the importance of Gloyn’s work and wanted to make it more widely known outside academia. He has since written a series of short essays relating to Gloyn’s work on his popular blog that have been viewed approximately 8,100 times since 2018. He has commented that Gloyn’s work ‘is leading to a renewed understanding of the depth of Seneca’s philosophy in the academic community, as well as to a wider appreciation of it among the general public. I regard this particular combination, a dual academic/public impact, as a model for scholars in any field’ \(S3\). Gloyn was also an invited speaker at Stoicon 2018, a large public event \(350 attendees\) exploring the relevant of Stoic philosophy for people today. Her talk about Seneca was recorded and is available freely online \(approximately 1,300 views\). She has since contributed to and been invited to join the editorial board of *The Stoic* magazine \(S10\). Through these channels, Gloyn’s research on Seneca has impacted on the ways in which modern admirers of Stoicism understand Stoic thinking about leadership, family, and relationships.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UCL research findings about the source, transport and fate of arsenic in sediments exploited for water supply in the Bengal Basin have underpinned the development and implementation of policy by the Bangladesh government and of international donors and non\-governmental organisations \(NGOs\) in the wider region \( *e.g.* Pakistan, India\). UCL’s explanations of the geochemical and hydraulic processes controlling groundwater arsenic have underpinned the Bangladesh government’s strategies for monitoring and mitigating the crisis and reducing arsenic exposure in the population. This has led to improvements in public health security among approximately 5,000,000 people across southern Bangladesh. UCL’s discovery of the poroelastic character of the Bengal Aquifer System has further informed the expansion of the Bangladesh national infrastructure for monitoring the groundwater resources, and reconsideration of the national groundwater monitoring infrastructure in India. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Arsenic \(As\) exposure – the adverse effects of which include cancers, diseases of the vascular system, and death – presents a serious global threat to public health. Since 1990, extensive arsenic pollution of groundwater has been recognised in Quaternary fluvio\-deltaic sediments exploited for water supply. The problem is especially acute across the densely populated floodplains of Southeast Asia, where shallow groundwater constitutes the only bacteriologically safe source of water for more than 100,000,000 inhabitants. In places, shallow groundwater contains arsenic at concentrations up to 100 times the World Health Organization \(WHO\) guideline limit for drinking water – throughout the region some 70,000,000 people are exposed to excessive arsenic and secure mitigation solutions are far from universally implemented. 

 Research conducted since 2000 by John McArthur and William Burgess in the Department of Earth Sciences at UCL has addressed the distribution, source, transport and fate of arsenic in the Bengal Basin of West Bengal \(India\) and Bangladesh, taken as a type area for Quaternary fluvio\-deltaic aquifers. McArthur and Burgess’ early contribution in 2000 \(with graduate student Nickson and collaborators in Bangladesh\) set out their deduction, from the geochemical context and analysis of water from 46 wells in Bangladesh, that groundwater arsenic derives from reduction of arsenic\-bearing iron oxyhydroxides in the sediments \( **R1**\). This finding demonstrated that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is a natural phenomenon, overturning the previous consensus that arsenic enters groundwater by oxidation of arsenic\-bearing pyrite in response to water\-table lowering by irrigation pumping. 

 Extensive fieldwork and laboratory analysis of groundwater and sediment cores from West Bengal, conceived by McArthur and executed in conjunction with lead collaborator DM Banerjee \(University of Delhi\) and other collaborators in the UK and India \(as indicated by the author lists in reference \( **R2**\), were conducted between 2000 and 2008. This work exposed buried peat as the main cause of the chemical reaction giving rise to severe arsenic pollution in the groundwater, and led to the development of the team’s “palaeosol” model \( **R2**\) to propose that the current distribution of arsenic in groundwater reflects the distribution of palaeo\-channels and palaeo\-interfluves which developed between 125,000 and 18,000 years ago as sea\-level fell and a late\-Pleistocene landscape developed across the Bengal Basin. The model was potentially applicable to delta regions worldwide which host organic matter in marshland and swamp. Further research using published data from 2387 wells and 176 new analyses of groundwater along a 115km traverse across the southern Bengal Basin, demonstrated the “palaeosol” model to be applicable at scale \( **R3**\). As a result, it became valuable as an aid to understanding regional distribution of As\-pollution, as a guide for groundwater monitoring and future groundwater development and for the avoidance of As\-pollution and siting of arsenic\-safe tubewells \(for example across the Indus River plain and in West Bengal and Bangladesh\). 

 Also between 2000 and 2008, Burgess worked in an equal collaboration with P Ravenscroft 

 \(consultant in Dhaka\) and KM Ahmed \(Dhaka University\) on an interpretation of more than 3,000 groundwater analyses, supplemented by sediment core analysis and permeability measurements. Using data from these studies, they established a hydrogeological synthesis of arsenic occurrence across southern Bangladesh \( **R4**\). Burgess, with graduate students at UCL, then developed conceptual and numerical models to show how groundwater flow controls present\-day arsenic concentration at shallow pumping wells, and to posit future trends. At basin\-scale, Burgess worked with UCL research student Hoque, doctoral researcher Shamsudduha and collaborators in Bangladesh to determine the potential for deep groundwater, which is free of excessive arsenic, to provide a safe alternative water supply. Via their analysis of more than 2,000 borehole records and development of numerical models, Burgess and his collaborators described the major elements of the Bengal Aquifer System to >350m depth, its development over Plio\-Quaternary time and the extent of its vulnerability to contamination by arsenic as a consequence of excessive pumping \( **R5**\). This evaluation underpinned recognition by Burgess and colleagues of the potential for deep groundwater to serve as a secure mitigation option throughout the Bengal Basin. Research findings were presented to Bangladeshi government authorities at workshops co\-convened by the UCL team in Dhaka in 2013 and 2014, and they supported an evaluation by the UCL team, together with international partners, of groundwater depletion/security throughout the wider Indo\-Gangetic Basin using a total of 3,429 in\-situ observations. 

 Between 2013 and 2014, Burgess and collaborators made high frequency \(hourly\) measurements of groundwater pressure over one full hydrological year, in vertically stacked, co\-located wells at six sites across southern Bangladesh, exposing for the first time the magnitude of hydro\-mechanical \(poroelastic\) influences of surface water loads across the Bengal Basin in perturbing, and in places dominating, groundwater levels in monitoring wells \( **R6**\). Previously, groundwater levels have always been interpreted as determined solely by hydraulic processes. Burgess’s recognition of the hydro\-mechanical nature of the Bangladesh aquifer and the common dominance of mechanical processes has led to a re\-evaluation of the groundwater monitoring strategy in Bangladesh.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 UCL’s research into arsenic pollution of groundwater and the hydrodynamics of the Bengal Aquifer System in Bangladesh has had significant impacts on policy, practice and public health security in Bangladesh, 2014\-2020. UCL’s research has guided the development and refinement of national policy on groundwater pumping in response to the groundwater arsenic crisis in Bangladesh and has underpinned practical approaches adopted by the Department for Public Health Engineering \(DPHE\) and the Bangladesh Water Development Board \(BWDB\) towards arsenic mitigation and groundwater monitoring. This has led to **improved public health security and security of access to safe water supplies across the region**. Key UCL research findings have been shared widely with stakeholders beyond academia, partly as a natural outcome of the collaborative nature of the research, to which Bangladesh government departments contributed through provision of access and data. The **reach of the impact was extended by** **Burgess co\-convening successive national conferences and workshops in Bangladesh** \(2013, 2014, 2017 and 2020\). Furthermore, Burgess was interviewed on BBC ‘Science in Action’ \(25/6/2017\), broadcasted via the BBC World Service platform \(weekly viewers 350,000,000\) \( **S1**\). Globally, the research has contributed to the implementation of UNICEF policies relating to investigation and mitigation of arsenic contamination and to water resource security assessments by the World Bank. In India, UCL’s research has **influenced the development of national guidance** for groundwater monitoring under the National Hydrology Project. 

 <ins> **UNICEF policy and directives on arsenic pollution, and implementation of World Bank assessments**</ins> 

 UNICEF has been a leading international provider and facilitator of mitigating actions responding to the arsenic crisis in Southeast Asia. The organisation has adopted UCL’s explanation of the underlying processes and causes of groundwater arsenic in the Bengal Basin as the standard paradigm for understanding arsenic pollution in alluvial aquifers worldwide \( **S2**\). UCL’s research provided fundamental support for UNICEF’s assessment of global health impacts of groundwater arsenic, which **underpins its development of policies and directives** for its country offices. By demonstrating that the existing state of contamination in Bangladesh was both predictable and manageable, UCL’s research notably **facilitated UNICEF’s proposals for rational and effective responses** \( **S2, S3**\), which have continued to be implemented throughout the period 2014\-2020. Significant projects supported by UNICEF and the World Bank since 2014, grounded in those proposals, include **implementation of the Bangladesh Government’s Department of Public Health Engineering \(DPHE\) 15\-year water supply and sanitation ‘Sector Development Plan’** 2011\-2025 \( **S4, S5**\).  UNICEF Bangladesh’s former Water and Environmental Sanitation Specialist stated: “UCL’s arsenic programme \[has\] continued, to a significant degree, to **define the research and policy agenda**” \( **S2**\). Separately, UCL research supported the World Bank's 2019 assessment of water security in Pakistan \( **S6, S7**\), enabling a comprehensive review of groundwater depletion and identifying pollution as the greatest long\-term risk to groundwater sustainability, with UCL’s contribution acknowledged by the World Bank Senior Water Resources Management Specialist for South Asia \( **S8**\). 

 <ins> **Guiding Bangladesh government policy development**</ins> 

 The DPHE Policy Support Unit leads the development of government policy in the water supply and sanitation sector in Bangladesh. The Dhaka workshops “Deep groundwater in Bangladesh: UCL research in support of policy development” \(January 2013\), and “Groundwater monitoring in the Bengal Basin: research strategies and their policy implications” \(November 2014\), co\-convened by Burgess for UCL, with Dhaka University and the DPHE\-PSU, were attended by representatives of the DPHE, the Bangladesh Water Development Board \(BWDB\), the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, the Geological Survey of Bangladesh, the Water Resources Policy Organisation, and the donor \(including UNICEF and WaterAid\) and NGO communities \( **S9**\). The advisory “Bengal Deep Groundwater Statement 2014, Deep Groundwater in Bangladesh \- a vital source of water” \( **S9**\), co\-authored by the Workshops’ attendees, is acknowledged by the DPHE to have influenced their policy decisions \( **S5**\) towards promoting the use of deep groundwater for water supply. The statement promotes deep groundwater as a long\-term secure water source to mitigate the effects of arsenic and salinity in southern Bangladesh, identifying seven points of consensus around which policy should be framed, and making recommendations for extension of the national groundwater monitoring infrastructure. The DPHE Superintending Engineer confirms that “The outcomes \[of UCL research\] **continue to help shape our policies and practices** towards deep groundwater pumping across the southern Bangladesh” \( **S5**\). 

 <ins> **Informing arsenic mitigation</ins> <ins>programmes**</ins> 

 The DPHE is the Bangladesh government authority with principal responsibility for arsenic mitigation through provision of safe water supplies. UCL research has been used by the Arsenic Management Division of the DPHE to **develop deep groundwater pumping as a mitigation strategy** \( **S5**\). Decisions on the optimum depth of arsenic mitigation wells in the DPHE 2011\-2025 WASH Sector Development Plan \( **S4**\) were underpinned by UCL research on the spatial and depth\-distribution of the arsenic source, and the hydraulic structure of the Bengal aquifer system. The Sector Development Plan describes national strategy for the investment of approximately USD20,000,000,000 in the water, sanitation and health \(WASH\) sector, of which approximately USD1,750,000,000 has been managed by DPHE over the period 2014\-2020 \( **S5**\). The DPHE Superintending Engineer acknowledges “the **very significant impact your department’s \[UCL Earth Sciences\] research has had in the mitigation of the groundwater arsenic crisis** in Bangladesh” \( **S5**\). 

 <ins> **Consensus framework for improving public health security**</ins> 

 Deep groundwater in Bangladesh is free of excessive arsenic. The implementation of deep groundwater pumping strategies by DPHE between 2014 and 2020, through the 2011\-2025 WASH Sector Development Plan \( **S4**\), informed by UCL research \( **S5, S9**\), is estimated to have reduced arsenic exposure – thereby **enhancing health, welfare and quality of life – among a combined total of some 5,000,000 people** across southern Bangladesh \( **S5**\). Public health security has also been protected by the UCL research finding that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is natural, and not caused by pumping for irrigation \( **R1**\). This finding has helped underpin the maintenance of food\-grain self\-sufficiency in the country since 2000 to the present day \( **S2**\). In 1998, there were demands both within civil society and at ministerial level for a ban on groundwater irrigation, then thought to be the cause of arsenic pollution. UCL research since 2000 catalysed and informed public debate about the issue, supporting counter\-demands that ensured the continuation of groundwater irrigation. The enduring impact of this reversal is affirmed by the former UNICEF’s Bangladesh Water and Environmental Sanitation Specialist, who notes that UCL research “ **created a consensus conceptual framework for understanding the problem** and, in particular, quashing demands for a blanket ban on groundwater irrigation”, and “the overall impact of tubewell irrigation continues to this day to have a **massive net benefit in terms of maintaining food\-grain self\-sufficiency** in Bangladesh and India” \( **S2**\). 

 <ins> **Influence on groundwater monitoring practice**</ins> 

 The BWDB is the Bangladesh government authority with responsibility for monitoring the quality and quantity of the groundwater resources nationally. McArthur’s research findings on the rate of groundwater flux at the arsenic source regions, and Burgess’s research on the rate of migration of arsenic towards pumping wells \( **R4, R5**\), alerted BWDB \( **S10**\) and UNICEF \( **S2**\) to the requirements and timescales for groundwater monitoring. Burgess’s identification of the effects of aquifer poroelasticity \( **R6**\) further **alerted the BWDB to requirements for expansion of the national groundwater monitoring infrastructure**. The research findings also **influenced the BWDB’s approach to groundwater monitoring**, in particular regarding the security of deep groundwater. It also informed their expansion of the national groundwater monitoring network, including 69 new monitoring points since 2019 \[and continuing\] and 905 piezometers selected for automation \( **S10**\). BWDB continues to **appraise the design of its national deep groundwater monitoring programme in light of UCL research**, most recently through consultation at the UCL\-convened workshops “Aquifer poroelasticity in Bangladesh: observations, modelling and implications for groundwater resources monitoring” \(February 2017\), and “Implications of aquifer poroelasticity for groundwater levels: what groundwater managers in Bangladesh need to know” \(January 2020\), both in Dhaka. According to the BWDB Director \[of Ground Water Hydrology\], “Over the past two decades…excellent fundamental research of the \[UCL Earth Sciences\] Department…helped the BWDB develop its approach to groundwater investigation and monitoring. At the 2017 and 2020 Workshops in Dhaka, guiding principles for groundwater monitoring in Bangladesh were proposed and re\-affirmed by the wider community of…water managers in Bangladesh, leading to **installation of clustered \[monitoring\] wells at 69 new locations all over the country…and 905 piezometers…selected for automation**” \( **S10**\). In India, UCL research on poroelasticity has influenced the Central Ground Water Board \(CGWB\) and National Institute of Hydrology \(NIH\), through a Guideline document accepted by the National Hydrology Project in India being supplied to all State groundwater agencies \( **S2**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Leeds researchers have developed and supported delivery of detailed low carbon plans for cities through the creation of innovative city climate commissions resulting in local\- to global\-scale socio\-economic and environmental benefits. Starting in Leeds, we provided the main forms of evidence leading to the adoption of ambitious carbon reduction targets, detailed low carbon action plans, and significant \(hundreds of millions GBP\) low carbon investments, especially in housing, transport and renewable energy. The research directly supported climate action in multiple UK cities. Internationally, it provided evidence cited in statements from world leaders that fed into the negotiation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and that encouraged international climate funds to focus their development assistance on enabling national governments in the global south to adopt and deliver climate friendly national urban plans. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the period since 2010, the Leeds research team, led by Professor Gouldson, has co\-produced research with local governments and diverse stakeholders in multiple cities to enable them to a\) adopt ambitious carbon reduction targets, and b\) design and start delivering detailed, costed low carbon development plans. 

 More than half of the world’s population now lives in cities \(UNDESA, 2014\). With the urban population growing by 1.2million people a week, 6.7billion people will live in cities by 2050 \(WHO, 2014\). This level and rate of urbanisation has massive implications for climate change – the IPCC \(2014\) concluded that 70\-74% of global CO2 emissions from energy use is attributable to cities. International agreements on climate change focus on national level commitments – but ultimately these need local level implementation, especially in cities, if they are to be effective. Frequently, however, urban capacities to design and deliver ambitious carbon reduction plans are limited \[1\]. 

 To address this issue, Leeds researchers pioneered the development of new methodologies that generate city\-scale, place\-based data and modelling on energy, environment and economy interactions \[2,3,4,5,6\]. The application of these methodologies helps cities to a\) adopt science\-based carbon reduction targets, b\) identify and evaluate all of the different low carbon options that they might adopt, c\) rank these according to their cost and carbon effectiveness and their wider social and economic impact, d\) use this evidence base to turn broad targets into detailed, deliverable climate action plans, and e\) work with stakeholders from the public, private and third sectors to build cross\-cutting support and raise finance for the delivery of such plans. 

 The research is unique/innovative in two main ways. 

 First, by analysing energy, environment and economy interactions in an integrated way, the research is able to evaluate the economic case for city\-scale climate action \[2,3,4,5,6\]. For Leeds for example, the research found that with a population of 780,000 people and an economy worth GBP22billion a year, the city as a whole currently spends GBP1.2billion a year on energy, but that it could reduce its annual energy bill by GBP270million a year, and its carbon footprint by 41% through cost\-effective investments in housing, public and commercial buildings, transport and industry. These investments would pay for themselves in 5 years whilst also creating 4,200 years of extra employment and helping to tackle fuel poverty, reduce congestion, improve air quality and enhance public health. The preparation of such an economic case for climate action has helped to secure support from senior city leaders and from stakeholders previously opposed to or disengaged from the climate debate. 

 Second, through co\-production based on participatory appraisal, the research generates high\-resolution, measure\-by\-measure, locally relevant data on all the low carbon options that might be adopted in a particular place that is trusted and ‘owned’ by local stakeholders \[2,3,4,5,6\]. Again using Leeds as an example, our approach has generated data on c.150 low carbon options, including on their carbon and cost effectiveness and their broader social, economic and environmental impacts. Access to such a detailed evidence base has enabled local decision makers to turn what can be an over\-whelming structural challenge into a series of more deliverable priorities, programmes and projects that they can work towards funding and delivering. 

 The research team has received funding from the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy \(CCCEP\), the ESRC Place Based Climate Action Network \(PCAN\), and the Global Commission for Economy and Climate’s New Climate Economy initiative \(NCE\)/Coalition for Urban Transitions \(CUT\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research was first developed and applied in Leeds in 2010, and has been applied subsequently in multiple cities and local authorities around the UK and internationally. 

 **Climate action, governance and investment in Leeds** 

 Leeds is the UK’s 4<sup>th</sup> largest city \(population 780,000\). The research was the main form of evidence that guided Leeds’ climate action plans from 2012, when the research was first published, to 2019, when a climate emergency was declared, and 2020, when significant policy changes and investments were made \[A\]. Since 2013, the research has *“helped create the evidence base to secure approximately GBP12,500,000 of grant funding in a GBP45,000,000 district heating scheme which is currently supplying low carbon heat to approximately 2,000 households across the city”* \[A\] **.** This scheme is reducing carbon emissions by 11,000t a year and tackling fuel poverty and fire/carbon monoxide risks in those homes \[B\]. In March 2015, it provided the evidence that underpinned the creation of a GBP26,000,000 Domestic Energy Efficiency Programme in the wider Leeds City Region that has retrofitted 5,558 especially fuel poor households to the end of 2019/20 \[A\], thereby addressing inequality and improving public health. 

 In 2019, the research: *“provided the main evidence base underpinning Leeds’ declaration of a climate emergency in March 2019* \[C\] *, committing the city to work towards net zero emissions by 2030”  \[A\], thus GBP270,000,000 was committed to a transport investment programme to promote public transport and active travel and the up\-take of low emissions vehicles across the city, to be completed by 2021 \[A\]. In 2020, it also led to the cancellation of a proposed GBP100,000,000 link road, with support switching to building a new railway station and park and ride scheme \[A\]. It has also *“provided the model and analysis … to shape how the Council invests GBP80,000,000 a year of capital funding in the low carbon retrofit of the Council’s 55,000 council homes across the city.”* \[A\]. 

  

 The research led directly to the creation of the Leeds Climate Commission in 2017 \[D\], an innovative independent body that builds capacities for climate action in the city, which is critical when there is little resource and no statutory responsibility for them to do so. The Commission draws together key actors from approximately 50 public, private and third sector organisations from across the city to drive, guide and track progress towards climate targets in the city. Directly informed by the research, the Leeds Climate Commission also ran a citizens’ jury in 2019 \[E\], *“whose recommendations have helped to shape the city’s response to the climate emergency”* \[A\]. The Leeds Climate Commission has been instrumental in building capacities for climate action and in supporting Leeds City Council in its climate action policies, programmes and plans. The Leader of the Council states: *“Research led by Professor Gouldson has directly led to the establishment of an independent Climate Commission in the city, which has drawn together actors from the public, private and third sectors across the city to support, guide and track progress towards both low carbon and climate resilient targets”*, \[A\], and in its White Paper Motion of March 2019, Leeds City Council states that *“through collaboration with the Leeds Climate Commission, it is now one of the leading local authorities in the country in this area. This is underlined by the unprecedented scale of investment prioritised by this Council towards carbon reduction measures”  \[C\]. The Council identifies the benefits of *“participating in innovative and enterprising approaches to public administration and governance that other local authorities may then seek to emulate”* \[A\]. 

 **Climate action in cities and regions across the UK** 

 The Leeds research team have replicated the research methodology developed and applied in Leeds to provide detailed evidence to underpin the adoption and delivery of climate action plans and/or climate commissions across UK cities and regions. Leeds researchers published carbon accounts and summary climate action plans for every local authority in the UK in 2018. In 2019/20, detailed accounts and plans fed directly into the climate policies and action plans of 45 local authorities across the UK. In Belfast for example, the preparation of a climate action plan *“had a transformative effect on Belfast’s work on climate change \- both at a city\-wide level, and within Belfast City Council… and on the city’s Innovation and Inclusive Growth Commission… This will ensure that* \[the research\] *continues to impact on the city’s economic strategy through this decade.”* \[F\]. In Surrey, the regional carbon calculations produced by Leeds researchers formed the main item of evidence underpinning the Surrey Climate Change Strategy \[G\], thereby directly informing 19 carbon reduction targets and 164 other climate action areas for the county \[H\]. In York, the research led to the preparation of a new climate action plan, to the establishment of a new Climate Commission, to new planning policies requiring new buildings to be zero carbon, to the development of a ‘blue and green’ nature\-based resilience strategy, and to a revised low carbon transport plan for the city \[I\]. 

 **International influence** 

 Internationally, the research has been replicated to support and guide climate action in cities in China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Rwanda, Peru and Brazil \[J\]. The Coalition for Urban Transitions \(CUT\), states that the Leeds researchers: *“…have then been able to scale\-up their work to provide robust assessments of the investment needs and economic returns from low carbon urban development for over 800 cities worldwide. These cities are home to over half of the world’s population and are responsible for around three quarters of the world’s GHG emissions.”* \[J\]. Through the Global Commission on Economy and Climate and the associated CUT, Leeds research was cited in a statement by world\-leaders published in advance of the UN’s climate negotiations in Paris in 2015 \[J\], with the statement including Leeds research findings that *“investing in sustainable cities could save around USD17 trillion globally by 2050. Investing in energy efficiency could boost cumulative economic output globally by USD18 trillion by 2035 and create jobs”* \[K\]. Through this statement, and through research presented in Global Commission on Economy and Climate’s 2014 report \(Better Growth, Better Climate\) and its 2015 report \(Seizing the Global Opportunity\), Leeds research also *“directly enabled* \[the Commission\] *to provide robust evidence and a compelling economic case for climate action in the world’s cities”  as inputs to the discussions that led to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \[J\]. 

 This research also helped to *“ensure that the international climate funds administered by the UK Dept. for International Development \(DfID\) and for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills \(BEIS\), as well as the German and Swedish environment ministries, focussed significant parts of their development assistance on enabling national governments in the global south to adopt and deliver climate friendly national urban plans”* \[J\].

 **Williams** has forged a new interpretative approach to exploring the long\-term relationships between medieval monuments, memory and identity from the Early Middle Ages to the present day and evaluated archaeology’s role in the production of social memory in the contemporary world. For the Welsh Marches this is manifest through exploring the significance, biography and landscape context of the Pillar of Eliseg and its public archaeology through Project Eliseg \(2010–present\) and the ERC\-funded Past in its Place project \(2012–2016\) \[ **R1**\]. This expertise has been extended to the interpretation and public archaeology of a re\-discovered fragment of 14<sup>th</sup>\-century abbatial funerary monument associated with Valle Crucis Abbey \(Denbighshire\) in collaboration with Llangollen Museum: the ‘Smiling Abbot’ \[ **R2**\] and researching both the past significance, life\-histories, landscape contexts and public archaeology of the linear earthworks of the Anglo\-Welsh borderlands: Offa’s Dyke and Wat’s Dyke \[ **R1, R3–R6**\]. These strands share in shedding light upon, and rethinking, relationships between people to place through monuments and memories in the Welsh Marches of significance to residents and visitors today, as well as broader national and international discourses on frontiers and borderlands as spaces of creative and transformative contestation and community over the long term \[ **R5, R6**\]. 

 Disseminated via academic publications, the creation of a new diamond open\-access journal \( *Offa’s Dyke Journal*\), academic blogs \( *Archaeodeath, Project Eliseg* and the *Offa’s Dyke Collaboratory*\), public talks, social media and the media, this research has consistently and cumulatively challenged both academic and public misunderstandings of the medieval monuments, their significance, biographies and landscapes in the Anglo\-Welsh borderlands focusing on the Pillar of Eliseg, Wat’s Dyke and Offa’s Dyke. Integral to this research has been **Williams**’ critical evaluation of digital public archaeology for the medieval monuments of the Welsh Marches as well as the real\-world public engagement and heritage conservation, management and interpretation of the monuments and their landscapes \[ **R3–R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Together with co\-convenors from a range of stakeholder organisations on either side of the current Welsh\-English border \(Llangollen Museum, Cardiff University, Clwyd\-Powys Archaeological Trust, the Offa’s Dyke Association, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales,  Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Partnership\), and initiating dialogues and debates far wider and affecting work by Cadw, Historic England and The National Trust for Wales, **Williams** has facilitated and directed enhanced awareness, implemented resources, and shifted attitudes towards medieval monuments beyond academia in the heritage sector, local people and wider publics. 

 This has been achieved through establishing the Offa’s Dyke Collaboratory \(2017\-present, now 54 members\), digital and real\-world public engagement and research networking, thus successfully establishing a new era fostering community, professional and academic collaboration in researching, managing, conserving and interpreting the internationally renowned early medieval monuments of the region \- Pillar of Eliseg, Offa’s Dyke, Wat’s Dyke \- as well as the later medieval semi\-effigial grave\-slab likely from Valle Crucis Abbey\), as well as their landscape contexts. Together, the activities have rehabilitated these monuments and their landscape contexts in the public consciousness through media, social media and public events and affecting decisions regarding their management and heritage interpretation, considering them in terms of local, national and international scales relating to the study of frontiers and borderlands past and present. 

 These initiatives were impeded and delayed but also effectively transformed in response to the COVID\-19 pandemic lockdown in the UK from March 2020. 

 To date, the principal changes in policy, practice and perception serving as evidence of impact have been: 

-  The results of 2010–2012 Project Eliseg fieldwork have been widely disseminated online and directly informed Cadw’s revised heritage interpretation of the Pillar of Eliseg and its landscape context through new signs both at the Pillar of Eliseg and Valle Crucis Abbey, established in spring 2017 incorporating Williams’s principal interpretations of the monument and its landscape context \[ **S1; R1**\] as well as new displays and interpretations of the Pillar of Eliseg in Llangollen Museum \[ **S2; R4**\] and by Cadw at Caernarfon Castle \[ **S1; R4**\]. 

-  Analysing and publishing new interpretations of the rediscovered ‘Smiling Abbot’ early 14<sup>th</sup>\-century grave\-slab, thus directly informing its heritage interpretation at Llangollen Museum  and securing increased visitor numbers \[ **S2**\] as well as global exposure via the Archaeodeath blog \[ **S3**\] and publication in a prominent international academic journal \[ **R2**\]. 

-  Enhancing awareness and engagement with medieval monuments via the establishment of the *Archaeopress* Wordpress blog which has become a key medium for public digital engagement about the archaeology and heritage of death & memory through 1,568 blog\-posts since 2013, many related to the Welsh Marches including 59 re: Project Eliseg, 81 re: Offa’s Dyke, 47 re: Wat’s Dyke and 376 about medieval monuments all disseminated across social media platforms. In the context of the Offa’s Dyke Collaboratory, the website has involved a prolific set of blog\-posts \(154 blog\-posts since 2017\) \[ **S3–S4, S6–S8**\]; 

-  Developing public knowledge and education in the Welsh Marches’ medieval monuments through the instigation of the Offa’s Dyke Collaboratory \(54 members at present\) and the creation, design and establishment \(part\-funded by the Offa’s Dyke Association and the University of Chester\) of a brand\-new diamond open\-access academic journal – *Offa’s Dyke Journal* \[ **R3, R5**\] *.* Two *ODJ* volumes are now published, disseminated freely online and through hard\-copies distributed by Archaeopress publishing. The journal makes reliable and relevant original research and resources freely available to scholars and local communities to combat pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology; it has been specifically utilised in public talks and for community groups \[ **S5, S7**\]; 

-  Successfully lobbying for a shift in the charitable aims of the Offa’s Dyke Association to encapsulate Wat’s Dyke as well as Offa’s Dyke and paying closer attention to the conservation and management of their landscape contexts \[ **S6**\] and raising awareness regarding the borderlands as a story of contestation and colonization \[ **S7**\]; 

-  Raising awareness, supporting and guiding heritage bodies regarding the conservation, management and interpretation of Offa’s Dyke including lobbying for changing heritage interpretation of Offa’s Dyke at NT Chirk and Wat’s Dyke at NT Erddig, plus the reception and implementation of the Offa’s Dyke Conservation Management Plan commissioned by the Offa’s Dyke Association, Historic England and Cadw, published in 2019. This establishes a new era for the future conservation, management and interpretation of Offa’s Dyke informed and sustained by the latest academic research via the Offa’s Dyke Collaboratory linked to strategies of countryside ‘decolonization’ \[ **S6, S7, R5**\]; 

-  Delivering community action through expert guidance by **Williams** and other Collaboratory co\-convenors, thus steering of local community groups in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Powys, Shropshire and Flintshire resulting in preliminary new identifications of ‘lost’ sections of Offa’s Dyke and establishing momentum for future sustainable and best\-practice community engagement \[ **S6–S8**\]. 

-  **Williams** lead\-organised a series of inter\-linked public\-facing events across the Welsh Marches organised by the Offa’s Dyke Collaboratory since 2017; together with a host of public conferences and talks by co\-convenors of the Collaboratory, and addressing related Offa’s Dyke and Wat’s Dyke, and other medieval monuments in the Anglo\-Welsh borderlands. These including a public conference culminating in an open\-access publication \[ **R6**\] and the 4 April 2020 ‘Special Offa: Communities and Offa’s Dyke’ day conference, initially fully booked for Trefonen Village Hall \(Shropshire\) but transferred online as a virtual tour and series of YouTube presentations in response to the COVID\-19 pandemic lockdown \[ **S7–S9**, see also **S3**\]. 

-  An enhanced awareness among the British public regarding the Anglo\-Welsh borderlands achieved through a series of public talks and events \[ **S9**\] and two high\-profile media appearances featuring **Williams** discussing Offa’s Dyke \[ **S10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights includes a clear commitment to freedom of expression. However, the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese investigative journalist, in October 2017 exposed the fragility of this commitment, highlighting the need for EU anti\-SLAPP \(Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation\) legislation. Research carried out by Dr Borg\-Barthet, examining in detail different approaches to anti\-SLAPP legislation, provided the essential evidence that was needed to underpin calls for change. His research formed the basis for the development of a common policy platform adopted by a cross\-party grouping of Members of the European Parliament and a coalition of NGOs, who used the research to advocate for change and to articulate the content of future legislation. As a result, the research has influenced debate within the EU about anti\-SLAPP regulation and underpinned an acceptance by the EU of the need for legislative reform. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Freedom of expression and the rule of law are foundational values of the European Union, and shared values of all democratic societies. Recent developments in several EU member states have demonstrated the fragility of these values, with threats to freedom of expression becoming commonplace throughout the Union. None was more dramatic than the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia in October 2017. Caruana Galizia was a Maltese investigative journalist who had been investigating and exposing cross\-border financial crime involving several state actors. It transpired that the assassination was part of a broader attack on press freedoms through SLAPP \(Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation\), a form of legal harassment, which some powerful actors use to intimidate journalists and activists with a view to avoiding public scrutiny. The situation in Malta served to emphasise the challenges that the EU approach to SLAPP created. However, an appropriate evidence base to enable advocacy for new anti\-SLAPP regulations within the EU was lacking. Research carried out by Dr Borg\-Barthet at the University of Aberdeen positioned him as the obvious choice to support this advocacy process and provided the essential evidence to make a case for change. 

 In 2016, Borg\-Barthet explored the structure of private international law in Malta focusing on specific regulation of the treatment of companies, including systemic deficiencies in respect of those companies. Through an analysis of the somewhat limited literature and case law on Maltese private international law, supplemented by an analysis of legal practice as evidenced in assumptions in courts and practitioners' reasoning, the research found weaknesses in Maltese private international law of companies, due to a lack of sustained legislative and judicial attention \[1\]. Further research by Borg\-Barthet examined the extent to which claims can be brought against shareholders in transnational disputes, particularly as regards cross\-border torts and fundamental rights infringements, asking whether economically powerful actors were able to insulate themselves from liability in cross\-border disputes concerning civil wrongs. By analysing literature and case law Borg\-Barthet demonstrated that the law is structured in a manner which 

 practical implications of financial and psychological asymmetries in transnational litigation and proposes international legislative reform to facilitate the enforcement of obligations \[2\]. 

 This research established Borg\-Barthet as an expert in private international law, with specific knowledge about Malta, where he was also qualified to act as an advocate. Because of this, in the days following the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, several Maltese legal practitioners approached Borg\-Barthet to seek assistance with issues concerning the private international law of defamation. Borg\-Barthet noted that journalists were being threatened with frivolous but expensive transnational litigation. He was then able to identify, through spot\-checking of high\-profile newspaper reports, that a Maltese bank had been using the mere threat of transnational litigation to force the deletion of online reporting of Caruana Galizia’s investigative reporting. This research fed into the development of a Working Paper, ‘The Brussels Ia Regulation as an instrument for the Undermining of Press Freedoms and the Rule of Law: an Urgent Call for Reform’, which showed that the threat of transnational litigation was possible because EU law enables libel tourism by allowing claimants to choose the court in which to bring a claim. In the Working Paper, Borg\-Barthet also developed an alternative model for the allocation of jurisdiction which would prevent libel tourism \[3\]. 

 When a court hears a case with connections to more than one legal system, it must decide which laws should apply to the case. In the EU, this is usually determined through shared rules, which allow predictable outcomes. However, there is no such shared rule for defamation claims. The absence of a common rule on choice of law in defamation cases results in a lack of legal certainty and requires journalism on cross\-border matters to apply ‘the lowest common denominator of press freedoms’. Borg\-Barthet’s Working Paper demonstrated the need for amendment of the Rome II Regulation with a view to harmonising rules on choice of law in defamation to make the applicable law predictable to the parties and therefore relieving journalists and civil society activists of exposure to multiple legal systems. 

 Critically, Borg\-Barthet’s Working Paper also argued that, contrary to the view previously expressed by the European Commission, the EU did have the legal power to adopt legislation which would introduce safeguards against SLAPPs. The research identified the basis for the adoption of legislation in the law of the internal market. Borrowing particularly from anti\-SLAPP statutes in the United States, it proposes that EU law should require Member States’ courts to allow expeditious hearings of SLAPP cases, and to introduce cost\-shifting sanctions. It also proposes further protections against litigation brought or threatened in countries outside the EU \[3\]. 

 The form and content of a possible future directive was articulated more fully in a Model Directive drafted by Borg\-Barthet, in collaboration with Ravo and Kramer. The Model Directive proposes that courts should be empowered to dismiss frivolous cases and to require respondents in such cases to be compensated. It is also proposed that Member States should provide adequate legal and other assistance to mitigate the financial and psychological costs of litigation \[4\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Borg\-Barthet’s research has prompted the initiation of a process of legal reform related to SLAPP in the European Union to eliminate practices, which result in the suppression of investigative journalism and public interest activism. The research has influenced debate within the EU about anti\-SLAPP regulation, underpinning an acceptance by the EU of the need for legislative reform. It has provided an evidence base for NGOs, enabling them to articulate the content of future legislation. Through events and online publications, it has also raised public awareness of the impact of SLAPP legislation. 

 **Creating an evidence base to enable NGOs to advocate for anti\-SLAPP legislation** 

 Following Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder in Malta in 2017, a coalition of NGOs  – PEN International, Reporters Without Borders, European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, Article 19, and Committee to Protect Journalists – came together to explore the introduction of an anti\-SLAPP EU Directive. This coalition quickly sought advice from Borg\-Barthet, for which he drew directly on the research unpinning the original Working Paper. Borg\-Barthet captured this advice in a report, ‘ *Advice concerning the introduction of anti\-SLAPP legislation to protect freedom of expression in the European Union’* \[S1\], creating a resource that was shared with the NGOs, as well as journalists and legislators at various events. Borg\-Barthet was invited to present the report at the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom’s UNCOVERED conference \(200 attendees, including journalists, civil society representatives, MEPs and representatives of the EU Commission in Berlin in January 2019 \(https://www.ecpmf.eu/archive/events/uncovered\-conference.html\), \[S2a\] and then followed this up by organising a workshop in Aberdeen in February 2019 \(where participants also included representatives of EU institutions\) \[S2b\], and at an expert talk on Anti\-SLAPP solutions, held at the European Parliament in Brussels \[S2c\]. A further talk was attended by circa 100 representatives of EU institutions, and representatives of NGOs.  Following the event, David Casa MEP remarked that the research “ *provided us with concrete legal proposals that will now form the basis our work*” \[S2d\]. This has been confirmed by the President of the European parliament, Robert Metsola MEP “\[Borg Barthet’s research\] *has provided a much\-needed basis \[…\] for Members of the European parliament to articulate our wish to see a proposal for an EU\-wide Anti\-SLAPP Directive that could fall within the limits of EU competence*” \[S2e\]. 

 Borg\-Barthet’s work was also used to inform a common position adopted by a broader grouping of 26 NGOs in their advocacy work in the European Union, and was presented as the rationale behind a proposal presented to Pia Lindholm, Deputy Head for the Unit for Civil Justice within the Directorate\-General Justice and Consumers of the European Commission. In early 2020, Borg\-Barthet also presented his research to circa 100 representatives of EU institutions, scholars and civil society activists at the European SLAPP Symposium, organised by Greenpeace International \[S2f\]. 

 Borg\-Barthet’s advice has enabled not only the development of a better understanding of the technical aspects of reform which would assist in the attainment of the aims advocated by the NGOs but has also provided public servants and NGOs with an opportunity to engage with one another to better understand potential routes for acceptable reform. Testimony from Article 19’s Head of Europe and Central Asia demonstrates the vital role that Borg\-Barthet’s research has played. Not only has it ‘ *contributed to the rapid development of understanding of legal shortcomings which enable the suppression of freedom of expression in the EU*’, it has also 

 *enabled a coalition of NGOs to identify the legal issues which enabled Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation \(SLAPP\)… On the basis of his work, NGOs developed their policy positions on anti\- SLAPP legislation, and were better placed to understand the broader policy and legal context in which our advocacy work was to be conducted. The articulation of clear solutions and well\-researched justifications for legislative intervention has been a crucial element of NGO advocacy in this regard. The research which Dr Borg\-Barthet conducted empowered a coalition of NGOs better to articulate the legal basis for the adoption of EU legislation, as well as the content of future legislation* \[S2g\]. 

 **Influencing EU political debate and legislative reform** 

 In April 2018, a cross\-party group of Members of the European Parliament wrote to the European Commission to request reform of EU defamation law. The Commission’s response at this stage suggested that the Union lacked a specific competence to adopt new legislation, and that existing legislation struck a sound balance between relevant rights. By drawing directly on Borg\-Barthet’s research, this cross\-party group, supported by the coalition of NGOs, have since been able to convince the EU to alter its stance \[S3c\], so much so that, by October 2019, Vice\-President Designate Jourová had been persuaded of the necessity to introduce reforms, as evidenced in her confirmation hearings before the European Parliament \[S3a\-b\]. As the Article 19 testimony confirms, ‘ *Indeed, as a consequence of the work which we have conducted with Dr Borg\-Barthet’s assistance, the European Commission has now included the adoption of anti\- SLAPP measures in its European Democracy Action Plan*’ \[S2g\]. 

 This European Democracy Action Plan <ins>\(</ins><ins>https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities\-2019\-2024/new\-push\-european\-democracy/european\-democracy\-action\-plan\_en</ins><ins>\)</ins>, published in December 2020, draws directly on Borg\-Barthet’s research \[S4\]. To continue the work, Borg\-Barthet has been engaged as a legal expert on behalf of the NGO coalition \[P1; 4\] charged with drafting model legislation and providing legal advice at meetings with Vice\-President Jourová and Commissioner Reynders. Jourová has also indicated that the Commission will consider the most robust legislative and non\-legislative measures available, once the expert advisory group has completed its work. Borg\-Barthet’s role in this shift in EU priorities is captured by EU Representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists: 

 *His academic research provided the Commission with the legal basis to revise existing EU law... Together, we have been able to secure commitments from the European Commission to act with regards to a recast of the cornerstones of EU law, the Brussels Ia Regulation and the Rome II Regulation. This is no small feat and quite simply we could not have achieved this without Justin’s leadership, knowledge and assessment of EU and private international law* \[S5\]. 

 **Raising awareness in civil society about the impact of Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation Legislation** 

 In the phase immediately following the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia, Borg\-Barthet used a personal Facebook page to publicise the hitherto undisclosed fact that accurate reporting of transnational interest was being deleted or redacted by every major media entity in Malta following threats of vexatious litigation. The revelations were shared widely through social media and resulted in four leading independent media entities informing their readers that they had been forced to alter online content due to the potential cost of defending a lawsuit outside of their own jurisdiction. As testimony from the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation affirms, 

 *Dr Borg Barthet’s research and publication on the subject of SLAPPs exposed the use of such covert action and its chilling effect on news media in Malta, enabling the affected media to publicly admit to having received threats of litigation, particularly from Ali Sadr and Pilatus Bank* \[S6\]. 

 The EU Representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists has stated that Borg\-Barthet’s work, initially used by the NGOs, has also raised awareness amongst civil society about SLAPP and its implications: 

 \[Borg\-Barthet’s\] *work in turn expanded to create a larger pan\-European civil society movement on SLAPPs, that has now mobilized not only press freedom groups, but environmental INGOs, trade unions, and lawyer networks to work together to expose and campaign against the problem. Through regular exchanges, it has been Justin who has been pivotal in providing INGOs with the arguments that expose the legal shortcomings that enable SLAPPs. His academic research … gave civil society the fuel to approach the Commission, and in turn again expose these flaws using substantive academic research as the basis for our arguments* \[S5\]. 

 The research has also been shared through the mainstream press, including explicit citations of Dr Borg\-Barthet’s work in the Guardian newspaper \(e.g. https://bit.ly/3tng1lR\) in the United Kingdom and multiple newspapers in Malta \(e.g. https://bit.ly/3qHCAQd\), as well as several reference to the resultant proposals on news sites such as EU Observer, Deutsche Welle, and EurActiv \[S7\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 RCA research led by Jonathan West and a team in the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design expanded the use of inclusive design techniques to address procurement and regulatory factors that constrain innovation in hospital and community health design. Building on the RCA’s participatory design approach with patients and frontline staff, the work resulted in significant impact in *clinical practice* \(10,000 ‘Wee Wheel’ pocket guides produced by Public Health Wales enabling nurses to assess urine output easily and accurately\); in *clinical trials* \(362 people with paranoia in three NHS areas participated in the ‘SlowMo’ digital platform clinical trial\); and in *commercial development* \(the ‘Flomark’ redesign of the hospital drip has raised over £400,000 from investors\). This research also enabled the HHCD team to work with hospitals and Public Health Wales to address challenges during the Covid\-19 pandemic. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2004, the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design \(HHCD\) has undertaken research in inclusive design for patient safety in hospitals, which has developed into collaborative studies with frontline clinical staff addressing broader healthcare challenges. Building on the work described in the related REF2014 impact case study, techniques and models of inclusive design research for healthcare have been further developed during the REF2021 period to address a broader range of factors and clinical settings. 

 Overall, this research has not only investigated how inclusive design techniques can be applied effectively to the clinical environment, but has also addressed improvements in collaboration across clinical and design disciplines to maximise effectiveness, and broadened the clinical context to include mental as well as physical health. The most recent development in this research has involved including regulatory and procurement stakeholders in projects in order to maximise the likelihood of research findings being adopted and achieving the envisaged impact on clinical practice, as these were identified as significant constraints to implementing design\-led innovation in hospital and community healthcare. 

 Research undertaken with the National Patient Safety Agency \(2006\) \(3.1\) resulted in a series of publications addressing user error with infusion devices and drug labelling and packaging.   The EPSRC\-funded ‘Designing Out Medical Error’ project \(2008\-12\) built on this \(3.2\), defining a collaborative co\-design methodology for design for patient safety which incorporated the ‘Double Diamond’ framework for the design method, as well as specific tasks shared across the collaborative clinical/design team, such as process mapping and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. 

 More recently, the ‘Safety = Design’ project \(2015\) \(3.3\) with Betsi Cadwaladr University \(BCU\) explored how inclusively designed interventions can help clinical and care staff in detecting a patient’s deterioration on a hospital ward. BCU provided clinical access for the RCA designers, identified staff and patients to participate in the research, and championed the design outputs. HHCD researchers led the co\-design of early\-stage concepts with clinical staff and patients, and rapid user testing and iterative refinement of the most promising designs resulted in two final interventions. 

 These methods were developed further in the ‘SlowMo’ project \(2014\) \(3.4\) with King’s College London \(KCL\) to include inclusive design for interventions in mental health. The project explored how inclusively designed materials can support the uptake of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy \(CBT\) for people with paranoid and suspicious thoughts. KCL provided clinical access for the RCA designers, identified staff and patients to participate in the research, and trialled the design outputs. HHCD researchers conducted the research and co\-design, involving observations, interviews and mapping with therapists and with people with lived experience. 

 This approach was further refined in 2020 with the gameChange project, which combined a transdisciplinary approach with participatory design to create interventions for mental health \(VR for psychosis\). 

 West expanded the traditional inclusive design research methodology \(focusing primarily on end\-users\) to include addressing commercial, procurement and regulatory constraints in the design\-led innovation process in response to his observations of the barriers to successful implementation in previous projects \(3.5\). This resulted in his development of the Flomark, a redesign of the hospital drip \(3.6\), a demonstration of how inclusive design methods combined with consideration of clinical, procurement and regulatory factors can produce a commercially viable device to improve the safety of infusion on hospital wards. The knowledge and networks established through this research meant the HHCD team was well placed to develop a number of rapid and effective design interventions for frontline healthcare during the Covid\-19 pandemic.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research has resulted in demonstrable impact on clinical practice. 

 **Clinical practice impact** 

 The ‘Safety = Design’ research resulted in two design outputs: the ‘Wee Wheel’, a pocket guide for nurses to assess urine output; and the ‘KidneySafe’ bracelet for patients to self\-assess urine output. More than 10,000 ’Wee Wheels’, paid for by Public Health Wales, are now in use across Wales, with further units in use internationally. Frontline staff and patients have noted the benefits, with the Programme Lead for Acute Deterioration at Public Health Wales confirming that: ‘ *‘*The Wee Wheels have been extremely popular with participants… \[and\] have been an important factor in raising awareness of acute kidney injury’ \(5.2\). The ‘KidneySafe’ bracelets are in use in community health settings, gaining particular traction in care homes. Further clinical research has shown that patient engagement with self\-assessment increased after deployment of the bracelets \(5.1\). 

 The ‘SlowMo’ digital platform to support the uptake of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy \(CBT\) for people with paranoid and suspicious thoughts has now completed clinical trials \(5.3\) involving 362 people from three NHS areas \(London, Sussex and Oxford\), funded by the National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) and the Medical Research Council \(MRC\). The results were positive in terms of clinical outcomes, with excellent indicators of usability \(adherence, acceptability, usefulness, enjoyment\) \(5.4\). These results are of particular significance given the widely acknowledged lack of evidence of the quality and efficacy of currently available mental health apps. 

 **Commercial development impact** 

 The research has led to commercial impact. The ‘Flomark’ redesign of the hospital drip has been developed to improve fluid management: one in five patients suffer complications or morbidity due to inappropriate administration \(NCEPOD, 1999\); 24% of incidents relate to flow rate errors, and 15% involve harm. The clinical benefits of the Flomark are primarily that it reduces error in drip set\-up. It has been subject to extensive bench tests, which proved its reliability and its accuracy across different viscosities, and to user testing on a hospital ward, which showed statistically significant improvements in set\-up time.  Thirteen frontline staff \(doctors and nurses at a London teaching hospital\) were asked to set a flow rate using the Flomark prototype, without any prior training in the product:  they were found to have set an accurate rate 69% faster \(25 seconds v 80 seconds\) than with standard drips. Flomark not only reduces set\-up time, but also increases reliability, maintaining a prescribed rate for twice as long as standard drips \(a series of head\-to\-head infusions over 12 hours\). Flomark would thus save the NHS an estimated £20 million per annum in nursing time \(based on 50s/rate setting, band 5 nurse = 20p/use, 100 million drips used in UK NHS per annum\). 

 West, as lead researcher, has established a spin\-out company \(Flowmark Ltd.\) to commercialise the Flomark innovation.  It has been granted patents in Europe, US, China and Japan, with further territories pending and further patents filed, and secured £55,000 investment from Venrex Investment Management in 2017. The spin\-out company has had licensing offers from two multinationals, with a licensing deal now agreed \(5.5\), and leading figures in the industry have confirmed that the innovation has both commercial merit and demand. A further £350,000 has been pledged from angel investors, and £200,000 from a commercial investor, which will support progress towards obtaining a CE mark, further clinical testing, and final design for manufacture and tooling. The pre\-company valuation of Flowmark Ltd. is \[text removed for publication\] \(5.5\). 

 **COVID\-19 design interventions** 

 The insights into healthcare design and deliver gained through these inclusive design research projects \(Section 2\) built up a knowledge base and a network of designers and clinicians on which the HHCD team was able to draw to create rapid and highly effective design\-led interventions which impacted directly on clinical practice during the first wave of the Covid\-19 pandemic. 

 For example, noting that innovations in visor design were proliferating early in the pandemic, the HHCD team, working with Great Ormond Street Hospital, coordinated efforts in the design community to produce one single version, which was approved for use. 

 When University College Hospital had to convert its theatre suites into a Covid\-19 recovery complex, the altered layout and function of the space, combined with redeployed staff working in unfamiliar settings, meant that there was an urgent need to establish an agreed layout that would be immediately comprehensible to all users. Engaging over Zoom with clinical staff, the HHCD team led by West designed layout posters detailing where the PPE zones, defibrillator, and other vital equipment was located.  An anaesthetist at UCH stated that the maps ‘were really helpful…  and helped us visualise the space as a whole and work out where best to place our emergency equipment’ \(5.6\). These remained in use at UCH during the second wave of the pandemic. 

 Public Health Wales was required to assemble Covid\-19 testing kits for both drive\-through locations and the home mailing.  A high level of accuracy by the user in the swabbing and packing procedures was essential, and while Public Health Wales had a variety of photographs and internet\-sourced images available to use, it had no agreed steps for the user to follow. The HHCD team converted these materials into two user\-friendly sets of instructions, which were also translated into Welsh, and were rolled out for us in the testing sites \(5.7\).

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Our judicial system increasingly relies on quantifying the value of evidence presented in court. As a result, advanced statistical methods have a strong impact on the administration of justice. Research by Aitken, Wilson \(both Maxwell Institute, MI\) and collaborators has applied Bayesian statistics to develop methodology for quantifying judicial evidence. They proposed and implemented procedures for evaluating forensic evidence from \(i\) multivariate hierarchical data and \(ii\) autocorrelated data. The procedures developed are now routinely used in forensic laboratories worldwide; the methods have been recommended in international guidelines for forensic scientists and have been used to support the accreditation of a UK laboratory. The underpinning research has been cited in expert witness reports in court cases worldwide. Therefore, the beneficiaries of the research include both forensic scientists and the justice system. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 The key research insight is the recognition that the Bayesian framework provides the tools needed for the interpretation of forensic evidence. This has led to the development of increasingly sophisticated statistical analyses driven by new measuring equipment for the examination of trace evidence and by the increase in computing power that enables the lengthy calculations required to be performed efficiently. Papers published from 2004 have contributed to this development and tackled two important problems: the treatment of multivariate, hierarchical evidence data and the evaluation of evidence in the form of autocorrelated data. 

 \(i\)  Likelihood ratios for multivariate hierarchical data. When samples of material obtained from a crime scene are compared with those obtained from a suspect, it is necessary to quantify the support for the proposition that they come from the same source. In many cases the data characterising the material are multivariate, continuous and hierarchical. Examples include the composition of glass taken from fragments of windows. The hierarchical nature then arises because variations within\-source and between\-source differ \(variation of glass composition in a single windowpane versus variation between different panes\). Research in the MI developed a Bayesian methodology to quantify the value of the evidence derived from such multivariate and hierarchical data. This overcame the drawbacks of earlier methodologies \(which often incorrectly assumed the independence of the different variables\) by providing a likelihood ratio \(LR\) that can be combined with other forms of evidence in an integrated analysis and leads to readily interpretable conclusions. The initial work \[3.1\] considering a two\-level hierarchy of data was extended to a three\-level hierarchy in \[3.2\]. The paper \[3.3\] also developed an implementation based on graphical modelling techniques which is adapted to multivariate data. The methodology is described in \[3.4\]; a 3<sup>rd</sup> edition has just been published. 

 \(ii\)  Likelihood ratios for autocorrelated data. This research was motivated by the need for methods to quantify the value of evidence relating to drugs on banknotes. Banknotes can be seized from crime scenes as evidence for suspected association with illicit drug dealing. Tandem mass spectrometry data are available from banknotes seized in criminal investigations, as well as from banknotes from general circulation. The aim of this research was to evaluate the support provided by the data gathered in a criminal investigation for the proposition that the banknotes were associated with a criminal activity related to cocaine in contrast to the proposition that the banknotes were from general circulation. Previous methods for assessment of the relative support for these propositions were concerned with the percentage of banknotes contaminated or assumed independence of measurements of quantities between adjacent banknotes. The research developed new methodologies for evaluating this support using the LR. These methods accounted for autocorrelation in the data caused by transfer of cocaine between banknotes and also modelled differences in contamination between different bundles of notes \[3.5\]. It has been argued in court that the datasets used for evaluating the evidence are inappropriate because there may be variability across the country in levels of cocaine on banknotes. In order to implement the methods developed in practice, further research \[3.6\] showed that there is no meaningful difference in quantities of cocaine on banknotes in different regions of Great Britain and hence there is no need to tailor the datasets to the region of the crime. 

 Additional research on the communication and interpretation of statistical evidence in the administration of criminal justice resulted in an interdisciplinary collaboration \[3.7\] designed to bring Bayesian ideas of the likelihood ratio and Bayesian networks to the attention of judges, lawyers, forensic scientists and expert witnesses.

 4. Details of the impact 

 The research has had an impact on the administration of justice, leading to a better use of evidence and accompanying judicial and economic benefits. This is split into three main areas: 

 **\(i\)** **The procedures developed in \[3.1\-3.3\] are now routinely used for forensic casework internationally.** 

 This is confirmed by various forensic experts from across Europe: *“The work of Aitken and Lucy … is the basis of our method for e.g. calculating LRs in glass and is still used routinely”* \[5.1\]; “ *His \[Aitken’s\] research papers and books are used as teaching material, \[and\] reference material to justify approaches in practical works such as forensic reports*” \[5.2\]; “ *Results of Aitken’s research, …are used in my daily forensic practice as a forensic expert in microtraces, i.e. in cases involving the analysis of glass fragments. I use it \(… LR model\) for the evaluation of the evidential value of results of glass analysis… The method is used in about seven cases per year…, about one hundred cases in total to date*” \[5.3\]. 

 A software package in the statistical programming language R known as ‘comparison’ which follows \[3.1\] was developed by Lucy and has been downloaded around 25,000 times since 2014, indicating the acceptance of the methods by the applied community. 

 **\(ii\)** **Research on cocaine traces on banknotes in \[3.5\-3.6\] has been used to support the accreditation of a UK forensic science laboratory and to support expert evidence delivered in UK court cases.** 

 The Scientific Director, Mass Spec Analytical Ltd \(MSA\) confirms this \[5.4\]: “ *The work … is routinely referred to in the supporting material \[in\] every court statement sent out by \[MSA\]…. As such, it is frequently subject to cross examination in Court, and the expert witnesses make reference to the peer reviewed papers regularly.  It is difficult to quantify, but the experience of the court attending witnesses is that ensuring that our offering is on a sound scientific footing has greatly reduced the ‘attacks’ on our methodology.*” and “ *the work demonstrating that the general circulation background samples do not vary greatly across the country has proved to be enormously useful following adverse criticism of the sampling strategy in the trial of Rashid et al in Sheffield Crown Court in 2015.  This work is referred to in talks given to police officers for marketing purposes, and is included in the “In\-house method validation” documentation provided to UKAS \[the United Kingdom Accreditation Service\] at Accreditation Assessment visits \(the most recent being February 2020\).*” 

 More broadly, the research in \[3.5\] has changed the way in which forensic scientists at MSA think about the presentation of their forensic evidence, resulting in improvements in the administration of justice \[5.4\]. MSA provided evidence for around 200 cases per year in the UK \(most of the UK cases featuring this evidence type\). Key Forensics purchased the banknotes part of the business in January 2020 and have continued using the research as described above. Further to the above, Aitken has given evidence as an expert witness based on research in \[3.6\] under oath in two trials: R. v. Hussain and others \(Snaresbrook Crown Court\) and R. v Parry and others \(Liverpool Crown Court\). 

 \(iii\) **The research has influenced the framework in which scientific evidence is presented in court and is widely used to train forensic scientists and lawyers.** 

 The book \[3.4\] is a well\-cited authority on the role of statistics in the evaluation of evidence in forensic science. One of the main methodologies set out in the book is that of \[3.1\]. The influence of the book on forensic casework is illustrated in \[5.1\]: “ *The Bayesian framework explained in the book is the basis for evidence interpretation and evaluation in the casework of the NFI*” and \[5.6\]: “ *The well\-known text book… is the fundamental literature in this field*”. This is further supported by the inclusion of the methodology set out in the book \(e.g. paragraph 2.4 on p6\) in the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes \(ENSFI\) Guidelines \[5.7\] which sets out a framework for reporting statistical evidence in forensic science. The book and methodology contained in it is used consistently by laboratories in ENFSI to train forensic scientists and lawyers \[5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.6\]. 

 The practitioner guides \[3.7\] are on the communication and interpretation of statistical evidence in the administration of criminal justice. These set out the likelihood ratio methodology in \[3.1\-3.4\] for legal practitioners, e.g. Sections 2.17\-2.19 in the first guide and Section 2.21 in the fourth guide. The influence of \[3.1\], \[3.4\] and \[3.7\] on forensic casework is corroborated in \[5.3\]: “ *The general ideas on application of LR approach in forensic sciences as expressed in \[3.1\] and \[3.4\] \(and disseminated in the practitioner guides of the Royal Statistical Society and the ENFSI guidelines\) are used routinely by me in the evaluation of evidential value of results of blood pattern analysis.*” The practitioner guides have been used in court cases \(e.g. in the Kentucky Supreme Court \- Ivey v. Commonwealth in 2014\), indicating that they add value to the presentation of expert evidence in court \(also see \[5.4\]\). The Royal Statistical Society and the Inns of Court College of Advocacy published an introductory guide to statistics for barristers and advocates \[5.5\] describing the general approach to evidence evaluation set out in \[3.4\] and \[3.7\] \(e.g. Section 1.7 and p66\-68\). As the Chair, Aitken led the contribution from the Statistics and Law Section of the Society and Wilson contributed as a committee member. This guide was recognised as a useful resource for training lawyers and judges in a House of Lords Science and Technology Committee inquiry in 2019 on “Forensic science and the criminal justice system: a blueprint for change” \[5.8, paragraph 132\]. 

 As evidence of the overall impact of the research in the forensic and legal communities, Aitken was awarded the Howard Medal of the Royal Statistical Society in 2018 \[5.9\] for work that is an “ *outstanding example of how a statistician can integrate with those in a substantive area*”. Reasons for the award included the research on cocaine on banknotes, \[3.5, 3.6\].  Further to this, \[5.2\] states “ *I can testify that Professor Aitken’s research in general has deeply influenced the way a scientist approaches the evaluation of evidence and the way he/she presents evidence in a written report or during a testimony in front of a Court of Justice.*”

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Vultures are nature’s carrion disposal system, preventing the proliferation and spread of lethal pathogens in the environment. Yet today, ‘Old World’ vultures are the most threatened group of terrestrial migratory birds on Earth. In the last 25 years, \~99.9% of *Gyps* vultures across South Asia – once numbering many tens of millions – have died, most thanks to unintentional poisoning by a veterinary drug \(NSAID\) called diclofenac. University of the Highlands and Islands research into the impacts and risks posed by NSAIDs to vultures has been crucial in establishing a clear picture of evolving risks in South Asia and beyond. It has introduced robust new analytical techniques, shed light on new NSAID threats, and influenced new regulations to restrict or ban vulture\-toxic medicines. It has also informed drug safety guidelines and national/international vulture recovery plans, all of which is underpinning conservation efforts that are now seeing positive early signs of vulture recovery in South Asian countries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research detailed here outlines the development and application by Taggart of robust analytical chemistry tools to answer key questions about the threat posed to vultures by certain veterinary drugs: specifically, non\-steroidal anti\-inflammatory drugs \(NSAIDs\). These drugs are from the well\-known drug ‘family’ which includes aspirin and ibuprofen. 

 In 2006, India, Pakistan and Nepal all banned the veterinary use of an NSAID called diclofenac, as it was causing widespread poisoning of vultures who fed on carcasses of treated farm animals. These countries were then followed by Bangladesh in 2010. To make this decision politically acceptable, Taggart and other scientists worked closely with conservationists \(led by the RSPB\) to demonstrate the safety of, and then promote the use of, an alternative ‘vulture\-safe’ NSAID called meloxicam. However, since 2006, there have been doubts about whether farmers would actually stop using diclofenac and switch to \(more expensive\) meloxicam, and whether illegal diclofenac use would simply continue. Ensuring this switch happened was critical if plans for vulture population recovery were to be effective. 

 In 2014, Taggart provided primary data to address these questions \[3.1\]. Using liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry \(LC\-MS/MS\), he analysed drug residues in livers from animal carcasses available to vultures across India, screening more than 6,000 dead animals \(cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats\) for multiple\-NSAIDs. This clearly demonstrated that diclofenac use had indeed declined, with the prevalence of diclofenac positive carcasses dropping by half since the 2006 ban. Also, meloxicam was being used instead, with its prevalence increasing by 44%. As such, the risk to vulture populations had reduced by two\-thirds. Although encouraging, this research still showed that significant amounts of diclofenac remained in illegal use in India, as did the threat to remaining vulture populations and to any captive bred birds due to be released back into the wild. 

 These analytical tests were also applied forensically by Taggart to determine if vultures were being killed by diclofenac or other NSAIDs. In 2015, he collaborated with colleagues in Spain to confirm an unexpected and disturbing case: the first documented report of a wild vulture being killed by an NSAID in Europe \[3.2\]. A Eurasian griffon vulture had died in Spain from exposure to flunixin, another widely used veterinary NSAID. This raised important red flags, as it provided the first evidence that wild vultures in Europe \(beyond South Asia\) were being impacted, and, indicated that bans on diclofenac alone would not protect them. Building on this, Taggart also analysed samples from 48 vulture deaths from India occurring from 2000\-2012 and presented the first evidence of wild vultures dying due to an NSAID other than diclofenac in Asia \[3.3\]. This study found evidence that nimesulide was killing vultures in the same way that diclofenac was, causing severe visceral gout and kidney failure. As well as forensic testing, Taggart also worked with colleagues in South Africa to provide critical analytical data as part of NSAID safety testing on captive birds. This work added aceclofenac \[3.4\] and carprofen \[3.5\] to a growing list of potentially lethal veterinary drugs that vultures could be exposed to globally, in their food. 

 This research has also been instrumental in building capacity in India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Taggart has trained researchers involved in vulture conservation to sample, extract, and reliably test animal tissues for NSAIDs. Advanced laboratory equipment \(LC\-MS/MS\) to test for NSAIDs can cost up to £1M, putting such testing beyond the reach of almost all scientists in India and other neighboring countries. As one part of this effort, in 2012, Taggart and colleagues published a study that showed that a low\-cost alternative – with certain limitations – could be used in South Asia instead \[3.6\]. This simple biochemical technique – an enzyme\-linked immunosorbent assay \(ELISA\) – could be used quickly and relatively cheaply, at \~£5 per sample. The technique can check whether tissues, including both cattle carcasses and dead vultures, contain diclofenac. This test enables scientists to screen samples in\-country and reduces the need for costly shipping and analysis abroad.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The precipitous decline and near extinction of South Asia’s three *Gyps* vulture species in the past 25 years, from many tens of millions to just a few tens of thousands of individuals, is not purely a conservation issue. Vultures provide multiple essential ecosystem services, not least by rapidly removing carrion and associated zoonotic risks to human health. The ‘cost’ of vulture losses in South Asia will be felt for many decades to come, from a human health, waste management \(cost\), cultural and biodiversity loss perspective. One article \(Markandya et al., 2008, Ecological Economics, 67, 194\) regarding impacts in India alone, has placed the ‘cost’ to human health from vulture declines \(between 1992\-2006\), principally due to increased scavenging dogs and resulting rabies transmission to humans, at \~$34 billion \(US$\). 

 The research highlighted here, in seeking to halt this biodiversity loss, has: armed NGOs with the primary data they need to persuade governments to \(4.1\) strengthen laws that ban or restrict NSAIDs in India, specifically to protect vultures; \(4.2\) supported action regarding veterinary NSAIDs across Europe to protect vultures and other avian scavengers; \(4.3\) informed and influenced international multi\-species action plans aimed at securing global vulture population recovery; and, \(4.4\) built robust NSAID monitoring and analytical capacity in multiple countries within South Asia. As a result, there are now positive early signs of vulture population recovery, and release programmes have been stepped up as a safer environment for these species re\-emerges. 

 **4.1 Strengthening laws in India to eliminate illegal veterinary diclofenac use** 

 Comprehensive carcass survey data for India published in 2014 – critical to protect vultures and allow population recovery – proved that existing bans on veterinary diclofenac had not stamped out its use \[3.1\]. It allowed the collaborative partnership SAVE – ‘Saving Asia’s Vultures from Extinction’, within which UHI is a research partner – to exert pressure on the Indian government to tighten laws. Within \~6 months of publication, this study’s findings were a central piece of evidence used by SAVE to lobby Indian authorities to ban large, 30ml, multi\-dose injectable vials of diclofenac \[5.1a\]. Millions of these were being sold each year, labelled ‘for human use only’, but farmers were widely using them illegally on livestock. In July 2015, the Indian Health Ministry banned these vials across India, restricting all diclofenac vials to just 3ml, rendering them impractical for use on large animals. Dr Chris Bowden, RSPB Globally Threatened Species Officer and SAVE Programme Manager who led the call to ban these large vials, said: “the data provided by carcass surveys was absolutely critical to help drive this legislative change, and without this robust research data, the ban would not have occurred” \[5.2\]. Further, he noted that a subsequent unsuccessful appeal against this ban to the Madras High Court, brought in 2016 by certain drug companies \[5.1b\] “would undoubtedly have succeeded in over\-turning this ban, had this very clear research evidence base not been in place” \[5.2\]. 

 **4.2 Informing European policy to mitigate NSAID risks to European avian scavengers** 

 In late\-2014, the European Commission \(EC\) expressed its concern about the potential impact that diclofenac and other NSAIDs could have on vultures and scavenging birds in Europe. This followed the widely criticised emergence of veterinary diclofenac onto the EU market in 2013, particularly in Spain, which is Europe’s primary vulture stronghold. The EC asked the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) to consult, consider risks, and report back. The subsequent assessment drew heavily on the research carried out and published by Taggart and colleagues \[5.3\]. Specifically, it highlighted \[3.2\], which reported the first \(and then only\) European wild vulture NSAID poisoning case, stating that it directly supported “the hypothesis that the exposure routes described are realistic” within the EU \[p21 and p24; 5.3\]. Also, in commenting on the relevance of Taggart’s research to the EMA process, the Vulture Conservation Foundation \(VCF\) stated that it provided “clear and indisputable evidence that medicated carcasses are available to and being consumed by scavenging birds in Europe” \[5.1c\]. The EMA concluded that “diclofenac use in animals posed a risk to European vultures” and recommended that various “measures are put in place to better protect the birds” \[5.4\]. Hence, in 2015, the EC asked all relevant EU member states to draw up National Action Plans to mitigate against these risks. This has now been undertaken in 12 EU countries \[5.5; p12 and 13\]. Mitigation measures adopted vary by country, and include: providing better risk guidance/information to vets, adding specific warnings regarding risks to wildlife/vultures to product packaging/literature; enforcing strict controls regarding fallen livestock on farms; and, instigating new monitoring schemes to test carcasses available to scavenging birds. The current guidance enforced in Spain, for instance, requires clear labelling and provides guidance about limiting NSAID exposure to wildlife \[5.6\]. 

 **4.3 Influencing internationally adopted, multi\-species action plans to conserve vultures** 

 Taggart’s research has also informed and influenced a major international action plan aimed at conserving vultures. A “Multi\-Species Action Plan \(MsAP\) to Conserve African\-Eurasian Vultures” was adopted in 2017 by the UN Global Convention on Migratory Species \(CMS\). The MsAP sets out to reverse population declines of 15 vulture species, the most threatened group of terrestrial migratory birds on Earth \[5.7\]. In the plan, \[3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4\] are cited in support of one of twelve core global objectives: “To recognise and minimise mortality of vultures by non\-steroidal anti\-inﬂammatory drugs \(NSAIDs\) and occurrence and threat of toxic NSAIDs throughout the range covered by the Vulture MsAP”. Most specifically, the MsAP \[5.7, p59\] highlighted the research noted here on flunixin \[3.2\], nimesulide \[3.3\], and aceclofenac \[3.4\], as these studies represented the most concrete evidence that these NSAIDs also posed risks similar to that of diclofenac. NSAIDs were then ultimately listed in the MsAP as the only ‘critical’ and primary threat to vulture species in South Asia, and, an additional ‘high’ threat across Europe, Central and East Asia \(Global Threat Priority Map \[5.7, p57\]\). Regarding the relevance of Taggart’s research to the final MsAP objectives, Dr Roger Safford \- Senior Programme Manager for Preventing Extinctions at BirdLife International \- the primary author of the NSAID sections within the MsAP, said it: “…directly informed…and thus shaped the proposed conservation actions to counter this threat, not only in South Asia but across the Old World. Without it, there would have been insufficient evidence to include NSAIDs other than diclofenac as threats, and so the MsAP actions in relation to these drugs would have been flawed” \[5.8\]. 

 The impact of the MsAP in relation to NSAIDs will be measured every six years, in 2023 and again in 2029. This will be assessed in part by the “number of CMS Parties and Range States to have banned or voluntarily withdrawn potentially harmful NSAIDs for veterinary use and introduced safe alternatives” \[5.7, p95, Objective 2\]. Since the MsAP was first mandated by the CMS in 2014: India banned multi\-dose vials of human\-use diclofenac in 2015 \[5.1a\]; Iran banned veterinary diclofenac, also in 2015 \[5.1d\]; Cambodia followed suit in 2019 \[5.1e\]; and, Bangladesh has entirely banned the diclofenac ‘pro\-drug’ aceclofenac \[3.4; 5.1f\] and partially banned ketoprofen, another vulture\-toxic NSAID, within its “Vulture Safe Zones” that encompass \~25% of the country \[5.1f\]. On the ground in South Asia, such action is now also starting to result in encouraging early signs of vulture population recovery in parts of both India and Nepal \[5.9\], i.e., “for the white\-rumped vulture there is now strong evidence….that a decline up to about 2013 has given way to a rapid increase from about 2013 to 2018” \[5.9, paper 1, p97\]. Further, it has now been deemed safe enough to begin to release precious captive and captive\-bred *Gyps* vultures back into the wild to assist population recovery, with releases starting in Nepal in 2017 \[5.1g\] and in India in 2019 \[5.1h\]. 

 **4.4 Capacity building to support robust NSAID monitoring within South Asia** 

 In 2012, Taggart demonstrated that a sensitive, low\-cost ELISA could be used to screen carcasses of vultures or their food for diclofenac \[3.6\]. The test was validated in India by Taggart and colleagues at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute \(IVRI; India’s premier Government veterinary research establishment\). Staff at IVRI and at the Bombay Natural History Society \(BNHS; one of India’s largest conservation NGO’s\) were trained by Taggart to undertake this test. Training is supported by a freely available manual compiled by Taggart and colleagues \[5.10\]. In 2014, this new capacity allowed IVRI to make a discovery with potentially global implications. They published the first evidence that diclofenac may also be deadly to other raptors, identifying clinical signs of diclofenac poisoning alongside diclofenac residues \(detected by ELISA\) in steppe eagles found dead in Rajasthan \[5.11\]. In a press release regarding this finding, Birdlife International said: “With fourteen species of *Aquila* Eagle distributed across Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and North America, this means that diclofenac poisoning should now be considered largely a global problem” \[5.1i\]. 

 Taggart has also been working with multiple SAVE partners in South Asia to transfer knowledge regarding NSAID monitoring and analysis, ensuring that techniques used in \[3.1\-3.6\] are applied in\-country to gather data consistently and reliably. This is critical if the research evidence generated in South Asia is to be used by NGOs to persuade governments to change laws and ban or restrict NSAIDs. Taggart has trained staff at: IVRI \(5 staff\) and BNHS \(>10\) in India; the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) in Bangladesh \(>10\); Bird Conservation Nepal and the National Trust for Nature Conservation in Nepal \(8\); and, provided training resources – both written guidance and equipment \- to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature in Pakistan. Collectively, this work is enabling more and improved data gathering, and helping to create a clearer picture of the NSAID risks present in each country. This work has been funded by the RSPB and more recently through SFC\-GCRF funding to UHI. Such activity is also agreed within and guided by the SAVE 24\-partner consortium, within which Taggart sits on the Technical Advisory Committee. Prof. Rhys Green – Professor of Conservation Science at University of Cambridge, and SAVE Chairman said that Taggart’s research “has played a vital part in the conservation of these species and continues to do so”, and that his engagement in capacity building has been “essential in ensuring that survey design and protocols for collecting, storing and processing samples were fit\-for\-purpose in the challenging physical and cultural environment of South Asia” \[5.2\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Despite being the world’s second largest investor in science and technology, China’s scientific credibility suffers from a lack of transparency and public engagement. University of Kent research conducted by Zhang between 2014 and 2020 has: 

1.  Achieved a significant breakthrough in promoting national policy change on the transparency and public engagement of science in China. 

1.  Initiated cultural and curriculum change in the Life Sciences in China’s higher education sector. 

1.  Raised international awareness of China’s public engagement deficit and informed high\-level science funding and governance strategies in the UK and in continental Europe. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 China is now the world’s second\-largest investor in science and technology, and overtook the United States as the largest producer of scientific papers in 2018. Yet, cases such as the CRISPR\-baby scandal, in which a Chinese scientist applied illegal reproductive germ\-line editing to produce the birth of twin girls, was but one example of how China’s deficiency in anticipating, guiding, and responding to social concerns casts a shadow on the public attitude towards research carried out in, and with, China. A series of studies on China’s science governance between 2014 and 2020 led by Zhang have identified three key issues that have hindered China from becoming a trusted player in global science: 

 **Finding 1: ‘ **Post\-hoc** pragmatism’ and the negligence of public engagement** 

 Despite being a global scientific power, China’s public engagement \(PE\) programme is still at a nascent stage. This is a direct consequence of what Zhang identified as ‘ *post\-hoc* pragmatism’, which has been a central regulatory ethos in China’s science sector **\[R1\]**. The stronghold of pragmatism is exhibited in the fact that the primary aim of scientific research and research oversight has been to minimise public concerns and disputes – delivering technological fixes to social problems without ‘unnecessarily’ opening up or engaging with public discussion. Unless there is concrete evidence of wrongdoing, Chinese regulators and the scientific community limit their interaction with the public. Consequently, Chinese bio\-governance is often *post hoc* in the sense of being reactive to international criticisms as opposed to being precautionary. Science communication and public outreach have never been included in research funding decisions, and have not been recognised as part of any science curriculum in Chinese higher education **\[R1\]**. 

 **Finding 2: The ‘credibility paradox’ in science communication and the need for capacity building** 

 Almost all of the scientists Zhang interviewed explicitly acknowledged the importance of PE, but they also pointed out a ‘credibility paradox’, which significantly discouraged their participation **\[R3\]**. That is, scientists felt that contributing to formal channels of public outreach often incurred more public scepticism and contention, as institutional\-led communication was often perceived as propaganda. Conversely, scientists without visible institutional and official endorsements seemed to receive more public credibility. This highlights that for China to develop effective science communication that matches its research capacities, institutional cultural change and communicative capacity\-building among scientific practitioners are needed **\[R4\]**. 

 **Finding 3: The need to p<ins>romote social embeddedness of new biotechnologies</ins> in and with China** 

 Through the pilot launch of the Educational Module Resource on PE in leading Chinese universities **\[R4, R5\]**, and through a series of workshops between the British and Chinese life scientists, ethicists, and regulators in 2017, 2018, and 2019 **\[R6\]**, Zhang found that, despite increasing transnational collaborations between China and the UK, hitherto there had been no real attempt to develop PE in a transnational manner. This significantly constrains the capacity for both countries <ins>to work with intermediaries across different cultural\-political contexts and share good practice for better social embeddedness of new biotechnologies.</ins>

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **1\) Promoting national policy change on the transparency and public engagement of science in China** 

 On 3 January 2019, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology officially accepted a set of five policy recommendations that were lead\-authored by Zhang \(a British citizen\) as their ‘ *Neican*’ **\[a\]**. *Neican* refers to valued official policy submissions that are put forward to high\-level government officials, this being ‘a critical channel for the making and revision of politics and other regulatory changes’ in China **\[b\]**. The details of the five policy recommendations are as follows \(each recommendation’s connection to Zhang’s underpinning research is noted in parentheses\): 

1.  Building ethics and public engagement teaching into the curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate science and technology degrees \(corresponding to underpinning research Findings 1, 2\). 

1.  Incorporating public engagement into research funding decisions and project management \(Finding 2\). 

1.  Improving research and responsiveness to public attitudes towards science \(Finding 1\). 

1.  Capacity\-building through interdisciplinary and international exchanges \(Finding 3\). 

1.  A more proactive approach in joining international ethical governance discussions \(Findings 1, 3\). 

 Given the closed nature of Chinese politics, for social research to be featured in *Neican* is highly uncommon, even for academic projects funded by China. To accept *Neican* from a British sociologist and based on a UK\-funded project is exceptional. 

 Given that the writing of this *Neican* spanned over 15 months, and that it was ‘reviewed and commented on by officials at various levels at the ministry’, the process itself ‘has instrumentally brought forward serious deliberations on improving public engagement of science’ **\[b\]**. For example, the national curriculum changes proposed in the *Neican* have already been followed by coordinated institutional actions. In March 2019, China’s Research Institute for Science Popularization \(CRISP\), a science media centre with direct Government backing, decided to systematically introduce textbooks on science communication, with Zhang as an external expert **\[c\]**. Given CRISP’s unique nationwide platform, when this textbook series is released in the next two years, it is expected to reach an audience of more than four million **\[c\]**. 

 In sum, as a direct result of Zhang’s research, a set of nationwide policy recommendations have been accepted through a highly significant official channel, and this has already led to material changes in science education in the most populated country in the world. 

 **2\) Ongoing science curriculum change in Chinese higher education** 

 To assist Chinese universities in incorporating PE into their curriculums, Zhang developed a pilot Educational Module Resource \(EMR\) on PE with detailed teaching instructions in 2017. This set of seven lectures are freely available online, and combine both international experience and Chinese case studies to support scientific practitioners and educators to learn about PE skills and how best to utilise existing communicative platforms **\[R5\]**. 

 As of March 2020, the EMR has been fully or partially adopted into the teaching of at least six Chinese higher education institutions, with an annual reach of more than 1,000 science students **\[d, e\]**. This includes two institutes at the Chinese Academy of Sciences \(Institute for Microbiology and the Institute for the History of Natural Sciences\); Tsinghua University; Communication University of China; Yantai University; Beijing University of Chemical Technology; and Beijing Institute of Technology. The EMR was designed not simply to impart ‘factual’ knowledge on international experience, but to set up a model on ‘how to inspire and sustain discussions’ within the Chinese context **\[e\]**. Students and instructors have described the EMR as an ‘eye opener’ on how PE can be effectively delivered in China, a country with a limited tradition of public debate **\[d\]**. 

 The ‘demonstrative effect’ **\[d\]** of the successful experimentation with the EMR has further convinced CRISP’s aforementioned investment in ‘systematically introducing teaching materials and channeling educational changes in China’ **\[c\]**. 

 **3. Raising international awareness of China’s public\-engagement deficit and informing high\-level science funding and governance strategies in the UK and in continental Europe** 

 In 2018 and 2019, Zhang’s research has been cited at length in *Nature*’ *s* annual special review on China **\[R2, f\]**. In addition, Zhang <ins>was one of the 50 delegates worldwide invited to present at</ins> the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing, the most significant global meeting on the future of gene research governance **\[g\]**. She also spoke at the 13th Berlin Debate on Science and Science Policy, an annual non\-public forum that aimed for open and critical debate with a small number of high\-ranking German and international decision\-makers in science such as the President of the European Research Council and *Nature*’ *s* Editor\-in\-Chief **\[h\]**. In particular, China is the UK’s key strategic partner in science. Since 2018, Zhang has been invited to share her research findings with the Royal Society’s Foreign Secretary, the Executive Director and the Science Policy Expert Advisory Committee. Her inputs ‘have all been materially helpful in informing the Society’s strategic approach to China’ **\[i\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Companies around the world from HSBC to the Dutch recruitment giant Randstad have applied the results of Cable’s research to **boost** the **wellbeing and productivity** of their staff. The Indian call centre firm Wipro, for example, says the research helped it to **reduce staff turnover** by a third. 

 Cable has produced a popular book that summarises the insights which has sold almost **40,000 copies**. And he has been invited to **address and advise senior staff** at firms including BMW, Facebook and Ericsson. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The research focuses on ways to **improve staff wellbeing and performance** by encouraging and enabling them to express their unique values and selves in the workplace. It has identified several steps that organisations can follow to become **more productive**, for example by reducing staff turnover. These small, low\-cost interventions can have **very large outcomes** because they **change the nature of the relationship between employer and employees**. 

 One study looked at why employees tend to be **more satisfied** at work when they believe the employing company shares their values. There is lots of evidence that this so\-called “value congruence” effect is strong and influences, for example, workers’ desire to stay with the organisation. The research \[3.1\] asked a different question: why do shared values have this effect? Through surveys of 997 employees at four water treatment agencies in the US, it **generated data** to show the value congruence effect was down to **building trust** between the worker and the organisation and its members. 

 Another project examined what happens when people exaggerate their skills and experiences at job interviews – the “fake it ‘til you make it” strategy. Surveys of **2,673** people from **107** countries tracked their attitudes and **how they performed** in the workplace \[3.2\]. The results showed that applicants who were more honest about the type of person they are, including faults, \(called self\-verification striving\) had **happier and more productive** experiences at work. Those who try to be someone they are not find it harder because they frequently lack the ability required and become less committed. 

 A related study looked at ways to improve the experience of employees joining a new organisation by finding ways for them to **express their best selves**, instead of just expecting them to fit in. In a laboratory study with students and a field experiment with 600 new\-starters at an Indian call centre company, the research showed that encouraging people to talk about their strengths, what they could offer the company, and to recall a time when they thought they had fulfilled their potential at work, **boosted** their self\-esteem, their workplace performance and willingness to stay \[3.3\]. The effects of this socialization exercise were also written up in a publication aimed more directly at the business community \[3.4\]. 

 A final project studied the **positive impacts** of workers being able to write their own job titles \[3.5\]. It surveyed 31 staff at the Make\-A\-Wish foundation in the US, who were encouraged to invent light\-hearted descriptions to supplement their formal titles. \(Examples included “goddess of greeting” and “duchess of data”.\) Surprisingly, this small change made a **significant difference** by reducing staff emotional exhaustion. A follow\-up trial in a health care system showed the same effect: staff given the opportunity to write their own job titles reported **less emotional exhaustion** five weeks later. 

 A popular\-business book **further explored insights** from the research. Called *Alive at Work: The Neuroscience of Helping Your People Love What They Do*, the book argues that the reason for all the unhappiness is biological: organizations, in an effort to routinize work and establish clear\-cut performance metrics, are suppressing what neuroscientists call our Seeking Systems, the part of our brain that craves exploration and learning.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The route to impact has largely been through the dissemination of Cable’s ideas and findings to a broader audience through the book *Alive at Work: The Neuroscience of Helping Your People Love What They Do* \[3.6\]. As a consequence, the results and insights generated by the research \[3.1\] \[3.2\] \[3.3\] \[3.4\] \[3.5\] have been **used by companies** around the world to **raise staff morale and productivity**. 

 Selling nearly **40,000** copies across the world, the book’s success has provided a platform for Cable to speak directly to companies. From 2018\-2019 he accepted invitations to address **senior staff at 18 different firms**, including Facebook, MetLife, Ericsson, BMW, Estee Lauder and Louis Vuitton. 

 Significant numbers of **senior business leaders** have read the book themselves and changed their practice as a result – at the banking group HSBC for example. The UK frozen food company COOK organised an event for 120 team leaders based around principles from the book. James Rutter, the company’s chief creative officer, who read the book and organised the event, says: “It has had a **real impact** on us at COOK.” The research, he adds, has: “really helped shape how we’ve gone about seeking to enrich and deepen our culture over the past 12 months”. \[5.1\] 

 Another example of the research having impact was the Indian call centre company Wipro. A field project there \[3.3\] showed that giving new starters an hour dedicated to asking them to talk about their strengths and to explore times when they had been most successful at work had a **surprisingly large** effect. Most strikingly, it reduced staff turnover by a third, compared to employees who received the company’s standard orientation, which instead focused on corporate values and behaviours. Wipro managers were **so impressed** \(the company employs 30 new people each day and turnover is a significant cost\) that they scaled up the results of the field trial and, following consultation with Cable, **introduced the practice** into the call centre organization in 2013. 

 Another **strong example** of impact is the Netherlands\-based recruitment consultants Randstad. It has incorporated Cable’s findings into leadership training for **1,000 senior staff** and integrated the “best self” idea \[3.3\] into its Customer Delight programme across **14 countries**. The company says: “The **impact** of the best self is such an **energizing moment**. It **lights up the eyes** and creates a completely different energy for the rest of the training”. \[5.2\] The company adds: “The work of Dan Cable has been helping **Randstad transform** and will continue to be **very valuable** to Randstad in the future.” \[5.2\] 

 The research has also generated **much interest** in the media – both popular and business publications. Dozens of articles have appeared from *Psychology Today* to *Forbes*. \[5.3\] Four pieces Cable published on the website of the *Harvard Business Review* have together reached 1 million page views. A piece on humble leadership alone has more than 700,000. “ **That’s amazing**,” says Kevin Evers of the *HBR*. \[5.4\]

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Next\-generation sequencing \(NGS\) facilitates rapid genome analysis of pathogens, but its use in public health surveillance and routine clinical practice has been limited by a lack of robust and customisable data analysis pipelines. Building on research establishing a new UK\-wide Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics \(CLIMB\), Cardiff researchers implemented a bespoke £5M NGS bioinformatics infrastructure for Public Health Wales’ new Pathogen Genomics Unit. This new clinical service resulted in: \(i\) more efficient and bespoke treatment for all HIV patients in Wales; \(ii\) improved, rapid surveillance of influenza and SARS\-CoV\-2 infection informing global vaccine development; and \(iii\) provision of critical data on the spread of SARS\-CoV\-2 informing Welsh and UK Government pandemic responses. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Next\-generation sequencing \(NGS\) enables rapid, cost\-effective sequencing of complete genomes used widely in research. A lack of robust, reproducible, and customisable data analysis pipelines, however, prevented large\-scale expansion of NGS for routine clinical practice. The MRC\-funded Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics \(CLIMB\) **\[G3.1\]**, a collaboration between Cardiff, Warwick, Birmingham, Swansea, Bath and Leicester Universities and the Quadram Institute, is a high\-performance computing facility customised for microbial data banking and analysis, and collaborative sharing of NGS genomic data. Cardiff researcher Connor led the design and development of the CLIMB IT infrastructure using his expertise in biocomputing for bioinformatics **\[3.1\]**. CLIMB is recognised by the Welsh Government’s Genomics for Precision Medicine Strategy as a key area of national research excellence. Over the REF period, Cardiff researchers used CLIMB to integrate NGS and high\-end biocomputing analysis tools for investigation of pathogen evolution and transmission in local and global outbreaks. These studies included: 

 2.1 Reliable mapping of viral genomes 

 The Cardiff team, with Public Health Wales \(PHW\), benchmarked existing software programmes for mapping viral genomes, and found that some failed to map zoonotic \(animal origin\) viruses, due to use of single reference sequences. During sequencing, ‘reads’ \(short fragments of DNA generated from microbial samples\) are mapped against reference genomes but viral RNA\-based genomes \(including influenza, HIV, SARS\-CoV\-2\) are small and can be diverse. These issues cause key sequence material to be discarded \(where it does not match reference genomes\), creating a significant risk of incorrect results \(e.g., when testing whether two cases form part of a transmission chain\). To address this issue, the Cardiff team designed a novel tool \(VAPOR\) allowing selection of multiple reference sequences; this improved the proportion of mapped reads by 13%. VAPOR was also able to classify 6.6 million reads in a mean time of 3.7 minutes, a significant improvement from standard approaches \(e.g., BLAST, which takes over 20 hours to classify just 2 million reads\) **\[3.2\]**. 

  1.  Identifying human DNA in microbial datasets 

 Microbial infection samples are often contaminated with human genetic material. Using CLIMB, the Cardiff team evaluated the effectiveness of bioinformatic approaches for cleaning up viral and bacterial genomic datasets. They identified that a novel combination of two sequence filtering approaches \(Bowtie, followed by SNAP **\[3.3\]**\) was highly effective in cleaning up shorter \(150 base pair\) bacterial infection sequence datasets. This approach was validated by re\-examining over 11,000 published bacterial datasets, revealing that 6% of the datasets were contaminated by unidentified human DNA. Implementation of Cardiff’s sequence clean\-up approaches significantly reduced the risk of false results or unusable samples **\[3.3\],** as vital prerequisites for clinical accreditation of a diagnostic service. 

 2.3 Tracking the spread of SARS\-CoV\-2 

 The bioinformatics approaches developed by the Cardiff team, and embedded in the MRC CLIMB platform, meant that, upon the emergence of the novel coronavirus pandemic, critical infrastructure to enable a UK\-wide genomics response was readily available. CLIMB supported rapid establishment of the COVID\-19 Genomics UK Consortium \(COG\-UK\), which includes the Cardiff team. COG\-UK used the CLIMB platform to track the geographical and temporal spread of SARS\-CoV\-2 in the UK and Europe **\[3.4\]**, and to identify new virus variants. In October 2020, the MRC awarded £600K **\[G3.2\]** to the Cardiff part of the consortium to provide these capabilities internationally **\[3.4\]**. 

 As part of COG\-UK, the Cardiff team led on genomic sequence analysis of the virus’s spike protein and a mutation within it \(D614G\). The D614G mutation is one of multiple spike protein mutations in the highly transmissible SARS\-CoV\-2 B117 strain. Via the world\-leading sequencing of 40,000 SARS\-CoV\-2 genomes in under 6 months, the Cardiff team and COG\-UK collaborators found that the D614G variant did not cause increased disease severity, but was linked to increased transmissibility and higher viral loads in younger people **\[3.5, G3.3\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Via the MRC\-funded CLIMB infrastructure, Cardiff researchers developed key methodological innovations delivering sensitive and rapid analysis of large\-scale pathogen datasets.  Working with Public Health Wales \(PHW\), the research led to the establishment of a bespoke NGS bioinformatics infrastructure for PHW’s Pathogen Genomics Unit \(total investment over £5M\), a key component in delivering the Welsh Government’s Genomics in Precision Medicine Strategy. This enhanced clinical and policy outcomes through, for example, improvements to HIV and influenza diagnostic services in Wales, and significant contributions to global surveillance of influenza and SARS\-CoV\-2. 

#  4.1 A new NGS bioinformatics service for PHW Pathogen Genomics Unit 

 In response to the Welsh Government’s Genomics for Precision Medicine Strategy, PHW recognised the need to provide a more advanced microbiology genomics service. The Head of PHW’s Pathogen Genomics Unit, Dr Sally Corden, identified Connor as a key expert to provide the required bioinformatics expertise to implement NGS as a routine diagnostic and surveillance tool. Corden noted that Connor was *“somebody who understood how to write the code to translate information from the sequencer and put it back together into something that’s a readable format for a clinician”* **\[5.1\]**. Corden initiated Connor’s secondment to PHW from Cardiff University in 2017 \(0.2 FTE, rising to 0.8 FTE in 2019\-20\) *.* Dr Quentin Sandifer, Director of Public Health Services at PHW confirmed that Connor’s appointment resulted in “ *key impacts on our service, including the development of the Pathogen Genomics Unit”* **\[5.2\]**. 

 Connor used his research expertise to benchmark and support the development of laboratory processes for a new sample processing pipeline, while also designing a new computational infrastructure to meet requirements for large\-scale data analysis, reproducibility and archiving, based on elements of the CLIMB infrastructure **\[3.1, 3.2\]**.  Connor also built an end\-to\-end bioinformatics analysis and reporting platform to meet clinician requirements around diagnoses. Sandifer explained that PHW “ *benefited enormously from Dr Connor’s expertise in the area of bioinformatics and pathogen genomics which has underpinned the development of the bioinformatics pipelines that produce the reports that are then communicated to clinicians and other healthcare staff*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 PHW’s novel microbiology genomics system resulted in new accredited services with automated reporting of pathogen sequence data directly to international repositories, including CLIMB and GISAID \(influenza\). Based on the success of Connor’s work, PHW invested in four specialist bioinformaticians as part of a new PHW Pathogen Genomics Unit bioinformatics team \(led by Connor\) **\[5.2\]**. Connor also assisted the Unit in writing a successful multi\-million pound business case to the Welsh Government for further funding to expand the NGS clinical service; this was awarded in 2019\-2022 **\[5.2\]**. The Chief Scientific Advisor for Health in Wales, Dr Rob Orford, confirmed the link between Connor’s research and the investment made in the Unit: *“The confidence the Welsh Government has in Dr Connor’s work is reflected in the overall level of investment we have made/committed to the Pathogen Genomics work within Public Health Wales – of which he and his team are a core and leading part – which stands at over £5M to date”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 Orford explained the significance of Cardiff’s research for the delivery of the Welsh Government’s Genomics in Precision Medicine Strategy, noting that it has “ *improved the ability of NHS Wales to diagnose, monitor and treat patients across a range of conditions”* and that the systems created by Connor *“provide situational updates to Welsh Government to support policy making”* **\[5.3\]** *.* 

#  4.2 Advancing clinical services for HIV, influenza and SARS\-CoV\-2 

 Application of Cardiff’s research **\[3.2, 3.3\],** alongside the new computational architecture and analysis pipelines Connor established at the PHW’s Pathogen Genomic Unit **\[3.1\]**, enabled PHW’s pathogen genomics service to deliver the following improvements to clinical services: 

 a. A new ISO accredited HIV service 

 New capabilities within the Pathogen Genomics Unit allowed PHW to launch a national HIV screening and monitoring service in July 2018. Prior to the service, patients’ RNA samples were sent to Birmingham, creating a 6 week wait for results. Further, the central facility in Birmingham was not able to analyse samples with a low viral load **\[5.2\]**. PHW’s Pathogen Genomic Unit’s new HIV service, using Cardiff research pipelines and methods **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.3\]**, conducts HIV sequencing in\-house, reducing sample turnaround to 7 days, and is able to provide more detailed and sensitive sequencing information than was previously available **\[5.2\]**. A further benefit of the new service is enhanced engagement with clinicians, allowing emergencies to be handled quickly, in a way that was not previously possible. Corden cites the example of, *“an HIV positive lady who was pregnant, and was late booking into the service. As the service is local, we were able to work during a weekend to turn around the report for the clinician within six days, as the treatment of the unborn baby was critical”* **\[5.1\]**. 

 Cardiff’s testing methods also enhanced clinical services for patients with low viral load: “ *We are able to detect resistance mutations below the 20% standard: down to 10%, and this allows us to detect resistance to anti\-viral drugs at an earlier point, and allow clinicians to make changes to a patient’s treatment*” **\[5.1\]**. This innovation delivers important public health benefits: once patients are receiving appropriate, tailored treatment, they are no longer at risk of transmitting HIV. The new service implemented by Connor and colleagues is also considerably more cost\-effective for the NHS: analysis of each sample now costs £150, compared to the previous £250 per sample **\[5.2\]**. A PHW Surveillance Report into HIV and STI trends in Wales \(2018\) estimated there were 1,585 patients being treated for HIV in Wales; this reduced cost therefore represents a saving of approximately £159K per year to NHS Wales. In July 2019, the service received formal accreditation \(ISO 15189\) **\[5.4\]**, making it the first ISO\-accredited NGS\-based HIV typing service in the UK **\[5.2\]**. Sandifer confirmed that the service “ *…has been built thanks to Dr Connor’s research and expertise, which have allowed us to offer integrase inhibitor sensitivity screening as standard, at improved turnaround time, and lower cost*” **\[5.2\]**. 

 **b.** Improved and rapid influenza surveillance 

 The whole genome sequencing approach of PHW’s Pathogen Genomics Unit also enabled more advanced and rapid sequencing of seasonal influenza, both of which are vital for successful global vaccine development. In 2017\-2018, the Wales Specialist Virology Centre was awarded £90K by the Welsh Government to pilot the use of whole genome sequencing for influenza surveillance, “ *based on Dr Connor’s pioneering next generation sequencing and analysis approach*” **\[5.5\]**. Dr Catherine Moore, Consultant Clinical Scientist, Public Health Wales and Wales National Virology Lead for Respiratory Virus Surveillance confirmed “ *as a result of the success of the pilot, we implemented changes in our influenza surveillance methods to make use of whole genome sequencing in time for the 2018\-19 influenza season*” **\[5.5\]**. Wales is now able to provide extra information by sequencing all eight segments of the influenza virus genome \(compared to the two via Sanger sequencing, as had been used previously\). This enhances monitoring for resistant mutations within segments PB1, PB2, and PA, which have the potential to affect new classes of influenza antivirals **\[5.5\]**. 

 The Unit’s new bioinformatics analysis methods also enabled more effective geographic mapping of outbreak transmissions **\[5.5\]**. Moore explains: “ *Our new system, developed in partnership with Dr Connor rapidly demonstrated its effectiveness, enabling us to sustainably sequence and share Influenza genome sequences with international surveillance databases...”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 As a result, Welsh influenza samples can be typed and submitted to international surveillance systems GISAID and ECDC within 7 days **\[5.5\]**. This improved analysis pipeline resulted in PHW sequencing 147.4 influenza genomes per million people in Wales, compared to only 44.6 and 2.2 influenza genome sequences per million people in England and Scotland, respectively \(over the same period of time, the 2018\-19 and 2019\-20 influenza seasons\) **\[5.5\]**. Moore confirmed that “ *the sequences we submitted that have been generated using Dr Connor’s methods will have been used to inform the design of the 2018, 2019, and 2020 influenza vaccine*”, contributing to global efforts to protect those most vulnerable to influenza **\[5.5\]**. 

 c. Rapid sequencing of all Welsh SARS\-CoV\-2 samples 

 Sequencing of SARS\-CoV\-2 is vital for effective tracking of virus spread, identification of mutations, and design of successful vaccines. During the current coronavirus pandemic, the PHW Pathogen Genomics Unit is responsible for sequencing all Welsh SARS\-CoV\-2 samples, feeding these data into the COVID\-19 Genomics UK Consortium \(COG\-UK\). This work was facilitated by Connor and his team establishing a new dedicated CLIMB\-COVID platform, which directly enables COG\-UK to analyse and integrate UK\-wide SARS\-CoV\-2 data. 

 At the start of the first UK\-wide lockdown \(between March 22\-31, 2020\) PHW’s Pathogen Genomic Unit had sequenced the highest number of SARS\-CoV\-2 genomes in the UK **\[5.6a\]**. This work ensured that the UK led the world in terms of genetic knowledge of coronavirus, having sequenced 806 samples by March 31, 2020 \(compared to 744 in the USA and 296 in China\) **\[5.6a\]**. By December 2020, PHW continued to lead global sequencing efforts \(20,736 sequences\), more than any other country in the world, except for England \(130,325\) **\[5.6a\]** and the USA \(51,212\) **\[5.6b\]**. \[Text redacted\] 

 **d. Informing government decision\-making to minimise** SARS\-CoV\-2 transmission 

 Based on his significant pathogen and bioinformatics expertise, Connor is a member of Wales’ Technical Advisory Cell \(TAC\), which provides scientific advice to the Welsh Government on coronavirus **\[5.8a\]**. In July 2020, TAC advised the Welsh Government to include genomics in its list of ‘Early Warning Indicators’ for SARS\-CoV\-2 in Wales **\[5.8b\]**. An October 2020 report by Connor, identifying the entry and westward spread of new SARS\-CoV\-2 strains across Wales **\[5.9\]**, was also used by the First Minister Mark Drakeford to justify travel restrictions into Wales from October 16, 2020 **\[5.9\]**. Orford confirmed that the research *“directly influenced Welsh government policy at the highest level of Government, demonstrating the spread of infection geographically and supporting decision making around restrictions such as the ‘5 mile rule’ and travel from high\-prevalence areas in order to protect the Welsh population”* **\[5.3\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Peatlands cover 3% of the Earth’s land surface yet store more carbon than all the world’s plant biomass combined. Damaged peatlands emit more than 5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The work of Mr Richard Lindsay has been “instrumental” in stimulating improved commitment to sustainable management and restoration of peatlands within **decision\-making at the global scale** by shaping inter\-governmental treaties and **UN policy development**, **changes in international law**, as well as **national policy development** within government departments and national bodies together with local initiatives supporting **award\-winning individual businesses** and communities actively involved in the sustainable management of peatlands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As a result of many land\-use pressures, peatlands globally are in a poor state, emitting carbon rather than storing it on millennial timescales as they would do in the natural state. Peatlands represent the UK’s most extensive semi\-natural habitat and largest soil\-carbon store but 80% of UK peatlands are damaged. Peatlands subject to arable agriculture alone emit more carbon than any other form of land use. Lindsay’s research provides detailed insights into the repercussions resulting from these pressures and offers solutions in a number of cases, influencing inter\-governmental decision\-making about peatland ‘wise\-use’ at regional and global scales. 

  

 Figure 1 Render of Peatland Pavilion 



Lindsay has collaborated with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation **\(R2, S7a\),** the EU European Topic Centre **\(R1, 2\)** and with researchers in the Congo and Amazonia, to highlight the urgent need for better mapping of the world’s peatlands.  He is currently working with the UN Environment Programme to develop a Peatland Pavilion for Climate Cop26, having produced a global assessment of peatlands for the UN\-led Intergovernmental Science\-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services \(IPBES\) Assessment of Land Degradation and Restoration **\(R1\)**. 

  

 Lindsay’s 2004 report on the Derrybrien peatslide caused by windfarm development continues to be widely cited, including by the Scottish Government guidance on assessing peatslide risk and continues to inform rulings of the European Court of Justice **\(S4\)**. 

  

 Collaboration between the Griefswald Mire Centre and peatland researchers across Europe has resulted in Lindsay providing the first comprehensive review of UK peatlands within the context of European peatlands as a whole **\(R4\)**. Working jointly with University of Edinburgh researchers, Lindsay published a critical assessment of methods windfarm companies use to evaluate potential impacts on peatlands **\(R5\)**, while collaboration with the University of Queensland has resulted in a re\-assessment of peatlands in the Great Sandy Strait, and collaboration with Nottingham Trent University and Spanish authorities has resulted in new understanding of peatlands in the Cantabrian Mountains.  Ongoing collaboration with RSPB and the IUCN UK Peatland Programme **\(S5a\)** has generated a range of published work based on the original Peat Bogs and Carbon report \( **S5b**\). 

 
This has led to commissioned research from both Natural England **\(S8\)** and Scottish Natural Heritage \(SNH\) **\(R4\)**, the former requiring detailed analysis for a successful Lands Tribunal case, plus a critical assessment of the UK’s longest\-running peatland experimental plots, while SNH required a critical assessment of the science behind recent planning guidance. 

  

 Figure 2 ‘Paludiculture’ in action 

Most recently, Lindsay is a lead researcher in the first experimental UK field trials for the concept of ‘paludiculture’ \(farming wetland species on re\-wetted soils\), working with the SME Micropropagation Services **\(S1\)** and the Great Fen Project with funding from Innovate UK and the People’s Postcode Lottery.  He is now a member of Defra’s Lowland Peat Task Force developing sustainable agriculture for peat soils \( **S3**\).

 At the global scale, Lindsay’s expertise has been instrumental in bringing about a **wider appreciation and preservation of peatlands** and thus **stimulated change** within areas as diverse as the use of peat in gardening, the managed burning of blanket bog moorlands, the impact of conventional agriculture on peat soils, and the recognition by authorities both at home and abroad of formerly\-overlooked peatland habitats. At a national scale, Lindsay has **provided expert evidence** for both Natural England and Scottish Natural Heritage in relation to specific peatland sites resulting in improved environmental conditions and/or improved understanding of land\-use impacts on these sites, **achieving major government savings \(S8, R4\).**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research led by Dr Comte, School of Geosciences has highlighted the risks surrounding unsustainable use of groundwater resources in Africa and has directly informed governance and planning in Sub\-Saharan Africa. This includes a UN development programme led by the Comoros government worth USD60,800,000 with estimated 450,000 direct beneficiaries leading and increased infrastructure for water monitoring. Comte’s research findings have triggered a review of groundwater data and model outputs relating to risk of depletion and saline intrusion by the Kenyan national water authority \(WRA\), which has helped shape training by the Regional Centre on Groundwater Resources Education Training and Research in Africa \(RCGW\) and crucially, raised awareness regarding the risk surrounding salinisation of aquifers to both policymakers and public. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In Sub\-Saharan Africa, groundwater resources are undergoing rapid and unprecedented development due to increasing global population growth rates, leading to increased water demand. Groundwater is an important resource due to its abundance and resilience to increasing climate variability compared to surface water. However, poor knowledge and management of an aquifer’s local and regional capacity to support large\-scale community development often leads to irreversible deterioration by over\-abstraction \(unsustainable extraction relative to natural recharge from rainfall\); particularly in coastal regions, where this can cause salinisation of the aquifers as well as land subsidence. 

 Due to poorly maintained government\-managed monitoring infrastructure \(borehole observation networks\), there is limited understanding of groundwater response to abstraction and climate variability. This means that use of groundwater through private and community boreholes is either unknown or unregulated despite efforts by the governments to register all groundwater users. This has resulted in significant underestimation of groundwater abstraction, leading to sinking water tables and saltwater intrusion. Intergovernmental agencies such as the Water Resources Agency \(‘WRA’, was WRMA\) whilst mandated to regulate the management and use of water resources faces a challenging task given the lack of information on groundwater functioning. 

 Dr Comte, a hydrologist specialising in the sustainable development and management of groundwater resources, has led research focussing on the impact of rapidly increasing groundwater exploitation on reserves in Sub\-Saharan Africa. Since 2015, Comte has built on a body of work demonstrating that government\-managed groundwater monitoring networks are inadequate and insufficient to provide meaningful monitoring of the spatial\-temporal evolution of the resources \(undertaken before he joined the University of Aberdeen\). From 2015\-18 Comte has led investigations on the impact of rapidly increasing groundwater exploitation on groundwater reserves, with a focus on depletion and saltwater intrusion in Kenya \[1\-2\], the spatial characterisation of aquifer structures and seawater intrusion in coastal areas, including the impact assessments of volcanic heterogeneity on coastal groundwater salinity through numerical groundwater modelling \[3\]. 

 Comte’s work, presented at the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association WIOMSA in South Africa in 2015 \[1\] showed that human activities \(e.g. increasing groundwater development\) are more detrimental effect to groundwater resources \(depletion and salinisation\) than climate change \(recharge variability\) \[2\]. He also showed that government\-managed groundwater monitoring networks are inadequate and insufficient to provide meaningful monitoring of the spatial\-temporal evolution of the resources \[2\]. In recognition of the value of the research, the WRA part\-funded a PhD studentship, enabling secondment of a WRA hydrologist to Comte’s team at the University in order to facilitate a source of in\-house expertise in Nairobi in groundwater monitoring. The research \[3\-5\], designed and led by Comte, has enabled the development of a strong working relationship with the WRA. 

 Comte’s field research in Eastern Africa \(2016 onwards\), funded by the Royal Geographical Society has expanded these initial findings \[P1\] to develop and embed a new conceptual understanding of the response of groundwater resources to climate change and human activities in Nairobi aquifers, relevant to the socio\-economic development of Kenya and the wider East Africa region \[3\]. As part of this project, WRA offices \(Nairobi and Kiambu\) supplied borehole completion reports and abstraction records. Comte and Oiro then used geophysical surveys and in\-situ groundwater measurements along with analysis of available long\-term climate and borehole monitoring data in order to assess the water quality of two strategic Kenyan aquifers \(the coast and Nairobi\), used by over 7,000,000 people \[5\]. 

 The research highlighted the need to map the extent of seawater intrusion and to understand key driving forces \- quality and water levels observed from monitoring wells showed the negative impact of groundwater over\-exploitation in both the long and short term. The water quality was found to deteriorate over time suggesting that abstraction acts as a primary driver to  [saltwater intrusion](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/saline-intrusion). \[3, 4\]. \[P1\] also examined the use of groundwater through private boreholes in the region. Using climatic trend analysis from seven meteorological stations and land\-use change mapping \(EarthExplorer website\), Comte and Oiro found that the practice and utilisation of private boreholes is incompletely regulated despite current effort by the governments to register all groundwater users, resulting in significant underestimation of groundwater abstraction. Findings also showed that in coastal areas, borehole construction was not adapted to the specific vulnerability of wells to saltwater intrusion, with the narrow, deeper boreholes, which are favoured by drillers more vulnerable to saline intrusion than shallow, large diameter wells. \[5\]. 

 In 2018, Comte was mandated by the consultancy group AURECON to implement a World Bank\-funded, Kenya\-wide water resources development project to provide hydrogeological technical expertise. Expertise specifically involves building capacity of the Kenyan Water Authority groundwater staff, through the approach of ‘training\-of\-trainers’, in numerical groundwater model application, including model formulation, testing and uptake of a range of long\-term \(100\-years\) sustainable groundwater management scenarios for use to policy making \[P4\]. 

 In 2017, as a result of these findings, Comte was contacted by scientists in Botswana who were keen to apply his findings to the Limpopo river basin \(LRB\), an arid, water\-stressed basin with high susceptibility to floods. The project titled ‘Extreme rainfall and floods in arid regions \(Botswana\): replenishment or contamination of water resources?’ \[P2\] provided the groundwork to develop preparedness and enhance community resilience to flood and drought conditions by building understanding amongst stakeholders of multiscale hydrological processes underlying droughts and floods and combine this with water resource planning. The project aims to forge stronger links between scientists and water management stakeholders including the Water Research Commission \(WRC\) and Ministry of Public Works and Housing in order to aid local and regional authorities by improving hydrological monitoring networks and strengthening communication between local and national levels of governance. This research has now been expanded under the flagship ‘Connect4WR’ project, within the DFID/FCDO’s SHEAR programme \[P3\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Comte’s research findings have drawn attention to key issues relating to the unsustainability of increasing water demand in Eastern Africa, such as poor monitoring of resources and extensive drilling and pumping rates \[3\-5\]. By engaging with and training water management authorities, policy makers and communities, Comte’s research has underpinned new guidelines for water managers, supported decision\-making and introduced best practice for local authorities and raised awareness of local communities to the risk of saline intrusion to water quality. 

 **Contributing to global guidelines for water managers ** 

 In 2016, Comte reported that natural saline intrusion and governance failures were key drivers affecting water quality in the region \[1\], these findings have been cited as a guideline within the ‘Groundwater Management in coastal zones’, a handbook \(2018\) released by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development \(BMZ\) \[S1\]. Germany is supporting efforts of partner countries to balance their water budgets, specifically projects that involve continuous monitoring of water cycle and quality. The handbook outlines the principles of good governance and acts as a guide for water managers in coastal regions globally; Comte’s research has been cited as a case study to highlight observed problems in coastal groundwater governance specific to East Africa \[S1\]. 

 **Guiding best practice in UN\-mediated consultancy** 

 In regions like Comoros where the water table is quite deep \(100\-200m\), a borehole equipped and tested is predicted to cost between GBP5000 and GBP10000. If boreholes fail due to salinisation this means losing tens up to a few hundreds of thousand GBP on borehole cost alone. In order to strengthen water management capabilities relating to water treatment, the Comoros government drew on Comte’s research \[1\] as part of the Terms of Reference of a tender published in 2016 of a major 8\-year, USD60,800,000 development project implemented by the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) under the Green Climate Fund \[S2i\]. As part of this tender, Comte’s research was used to inform the initial feasibility study, with figures from \[1\] used to illustrate main groundwater salinities of surveyed wells, correlations between borehole/well salinity \(Fig 7\), geology and distance to coast \(Fig 9\), pumping schedules for dry and wet seasons \(Fig 10\) \[S2ii\].The project, governed by the Comoros Ministry of Energy, Agriculture, Fisheries, Environment, Country Planning and Urbanism \(MEAPEATU\) was approved in 2018 and is estimated to have 450,000 direct beneficiaries \[S2iii\]. Comte’s research findings \[1\] were used to focus the project and provided guidance on the vulnerability of sites to saltwater intrusion thereby enabling the Comoros government to make an informed decision regarding selection of the appropriate implementing organisation \(e.g. UNDP\) with the highest standards for risk\-mitigation, thus ensuring long\-term cost savings \(lower borehole failure rate\) and reduced likelihood of salinisation. 

 **Regional governance, policy and infrastructure** 

 In Kenya, Comte’s research findings \[3\] have been incorporated into national\-scale policy guidelines and have underpinned a terms of reference for national groundwater development project tenders, relating to demand and supply of fresh water and the construction of boreholes by the WRA \[S3\]. Comte’s research \[1\] has also been cited in the Government of Kenya \(2017\) ‘State of the Coast Report II: Enhancing Integrated Management of Coastal and Marine Resources in Kenya, release by the National Environment Management Authority \(NEMA\), Nairobi \[S4\], under section 6.2.2 in order to highlight the imbalance between demand for piped water and supply in Kilifi County. 

 Comte’s research \[1, 3\] is being acted upon at the national level by the WRA of Kenya to inform the groundwater, water quality and permitting sections of the WRA national office \[S5i\]. The WRA are using Comte’s research findings including new groundwater quality data and model outputs relating to risk of depletion and saline intrusion \[2,3,4\] to \(1\) undertake appraisal of existing groundwater monitoring data and redesign their plans and sites for the development of future groundwater monitoring infrastructure, such as observation boreholes \[S5ii\], \(2\) improve abstraction metering and water allocation to users \[S5ii\] and \(3\) enforce effluent discharge regulations for wetlands \[S5ii\] in the Nairobi/Rift Valley and South Coast regions. The WRA Technical Coordination Manager confirmed that: 

 ‘*Dr Comte’s research work is being used to guide ongoing drilling of groundwater monitoring networks along the south coast costing a total amount of Kenya Shillings 12, 686,920.00 \(USD 126,896.2*\).’ \[S5iii\] 

 **Introducing guidelines and training for water authorities** 

 In the Nairobi region, Comte’s expertise and his research findings identifying wetlands as areas of preferential groundwater recharge \[2\] have heavily informed the WRA’s legal office in their development of a new policy to regulate private urban development, enforce new standards for protection of these wetland areas, and provide evidence of ongoing litigations between the WRA and private developers \[S6\]. Comte’s extensive in\-field expertise, has led to the WRA’s groundwater section seeking his advice on replacement of field instruments best suited for groundwater exploration in Kenya, as well as training for maintenance thereby informing their approach \[S6\]. Regionally, groundwater salinity maps and models resulting from the research \[3\] are being used by the WRA’s south coast \(Mombasa\) office to support community water development \[S6\]. The WRA and are using the salinity maps from modelling to plan water management in accordance with susceptibility to saltwater intrusion as highlighted by the maps to improve models to run management scenarios and salinity modelling \[S5, S7\]. 

 In 2015\-2018 the WRA provided financial support to build capacity for in\-house skill development and expertise building in groundwater resources assessment, modelling and management. Comte contributed by providing direct staff training through supervision of the PhD of Samson Oiro, on secondment from WRA’s groundwater section. This secondment has been integral to the application of numerical models for management scenario testing, in order to better manage pressures on groundwater resources in Kenya \[S5iii\]. Comte in association with AURECON \[P4\] has worked with the WRA to strengthen its ‘in\-house’ capacity in terms of skills and infrastructure including development of a Groundwater and Management Guideline and a National Aquifer map based on geology and surface water catchments \[S6\]. Through the project, recommendations have been released to support efforts to strengthen water resource management and planning including deployment of systematic monitoring of active boreholes, particularly for users with high water consumption and use of smart water meters in cases of severe depletion \[S6\]. 

 The training approach, led by Comte, Oiro and the WRA has been praised and deemed exemplary for capacity building by the Regional Centre on Groundwater Resources Education Training and Research in Africa \(RCGW\) one of the key inter\-governmental organisations. Director General of RCGW, stated that: 

 *\(Comte and Oiro\) are providing key reference materials for policy makers currently used to assist the Water Resources Authority in designing their new groundwater management plans. In addition, the current groundwater modelling training project led by Prof Comte for the Water Resources Authority, involving WRA staff placements and training of trainers is exemplary for efficient and long\-term capacity building of East African water decision makers* \[S7\]. 

 **Raising awareness in communities** 

 Communities in Sub\-Saharan Africa \(particularly in rural areas\) often rely on unregulated groundwater access points, and often lack knowledge of management and safeguarding of groundwater resources, and require training. In Kenya, Comte’s research findings \[2, 3\] supported the introduction of a new collaboration between the WRA and non\-governmental organisation, CORDIO, a Kenyan non\-profit research institution working at the community level for environmental sustainability \[P3\]. Although CORDIO initially focused on marine and coastal environments, Comte’s findings relating to the effects of inland saltwater intrusion has since 2017 encouraged CORDI to focus efforts on introducing a consultative approach to practice with communities and WRA policy\-makers \[S8i\]. In addition, during engagement with communities in coastal Kenya \[P1\], Comte and Oiro engaged with private water well owners, local water user representatives, schools and mosques in order to provide technical advice for safe groundwater practices \[S8ii\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Accurate and efficient monitoring of inland water quality is essential to ensure global water security. Before the University of Stirling conducted this research, monitoring at the global scale was infeasible. Our research has enabled global satellite monitoring of lakes and reservoirs that is: 

 **Impact 1:** **transforming how the Scottish Environment Protection Agency manage water bodies**, going beyond compliance monitoring for lake and reservoir condition. 

 **Impact 2:** **optimising UK reservoir management** for increased efficiencies, proactive environ\-mental protection and safeguarding water quality for **Anglian Water and Scottish Water**. 

 

**Impact 3:** **giving the United Nations an unrivalled level of global water quality monitoring** \(>50% of inland water bodies\), which underpins a multitude of international and national water security initiatives and strategies under Sustainable Development Goal 6 \- Clean Water and Sanitation. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 **Creating the Step Change in Global\-Scale Observation** 

 **Challenges:** Critical for global water security, lakes and reservoirs represent some of the most vulnerable ecosystems to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. With an estimated 117 million lakes globally, these systems represent over 85% of the world’s surface freshwater. However, significantly fewer than 1% of these \(by number\) are being monitored regularly for management purposes: this represents a fundamental global ecosystem that we know relatively little about. Earth observation \(EO\) offers unrivalled opportunity to monitor and assess the changing status of water globally, but the ability to retrieve such information reliably from spaceborne sensors has been hindered by the complexity of water colour variation in inland and coastal environments. 

 **Solutions \- Innovation in satellite data analysis:** The Stirling\-led NERC GloboLakes project \(2012\-2018\) \( [www.globolakes.ac.uk](http://www.globolakes.ac.uk/)\) \[ **F1**\] pioneered the application of EO for lake condition monitoring including temperature \[ **R1**\] from the local to the global scale. This breakthrough was brought about by a highly novel approach for identifying key differences in the reflectance signatures of inland waters \(optical water types; OWTs\). Classification of OWTs \[ **R2**\] transformed our ability to select, optimise, and apply OWT\-tuned algorithms for the retrieval of information on water constituents such as chlorophyll\- *a* \[ **R3**\]. This step change benefited greatly from the collaboration that we led with over 30 international partners, providing data on more than 1500 lakes that are now openly available via the community\-owned LIMNADES database \( [https://limnades.stir.ac.uk](https://limnades.stir.ac.uk/)\), developed and managed by Stirling. 

 Having created the first fully\-characterised global OWT classification \[ **R2**\], the next step was to retrieve this information reliably from satellites. Critical to the success of the GloboLakes project and subsequent research has been the development and implementation of a robust atmospheric correction model and pairing this with water quality algorithms parameterised for global application \[ **R4, R5**\]. The GloboLakes’ solution is globally\-adaptive, using a dynamic selection of OWT\-algorithms that reliably retrieve water quality information from inland and coastal waters \[ **R3**\]. 

 Following our pioneering globally\-adaptive solution, we worked in partnership with the Plymouth Marine Laboratory and Brockmann Consult \(Germany\) to develop the first open and free operational inland water processing chain: Calimnos. This delivers the capability to monitor some 50% of the world’s inland surface waters \(for waterbodies >0.1km<sup>2</sup>\). We have also worked with researchers around the world to support the global assessment of the trophic state of inland waters using satellite data \[e.g. **R6**\]. 

 **Solutions \- Building operational processing chains & research infrastructures:** New projects stemmed from innovation within GloboLakes \[ **F1**\], including the development of innovative and higher\-level products such as phytoplankton size classes, harmful algal bloom indicators and carbon fixation in inland \(FP7 INFORM\) \[ **F2**\] and coastal waters \(H2020 CoastObs\) \[ **F3**\]. H2020 EOMORES \[ **F4**\] has developed a framework for operational monitoring services for inland and coastal waters based on the most up\-to\-date satellite data, innovative *in situ* instruments and ecological models. Services and products are co\-developed with 12 end\-users \(industry, regulators\) across Europe, and a Memorandum of Understanding provides a commercial framework for exploitation. 

 
 **Figure 1.** Chlorophyll *a* concentrations and lake area of 933 lakes and reservoirs currently being observed by Stirling’s UK Lake Observatory. 

The Calimnos processing chain developed for GloboLakes \[ **F1**\] now supports NEODAAS services \( [www.neodaas.ac.uk](http://www.neodaas.ac.uk/)\), which uniquely provides processed EO data for a wide range of UK science users. Across Europe it underpins the Copernicus Global Land Operations “Cryosphere and Water” service \( [https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lwq](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lwq)\) \(CGLOPS\-2\) \[ **E4**\]. Rigorous validation of satellite data for these optically complex environments is central to future progress and this is being pursued as part of the H2020 MONOCLE \[ **F7**\] and ESA Lakes CCI projects \[ **F8**\]. This also supports the development of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures \(ESFRI\) Pan\-European Infrastructure on River\-Sea Systems \(DANUBIUS\-RI\) where Stirling and the Plymouth Marine Laboratory \(PML\) co\-lead the Observation Node \[ **F9, F10**\]. 

 The latest generation of European Space Agency satellites \(Sentinel\-3 OLCI and Sentinel\-2 MSI constellations\) lets us shift the monitoring paradigm from one that has been too infrequent \(e.g. bi\-monthly\), reactive, and spatially limited; to frequent, proactive and highly targeted cost\-efficient *in situ* monitoring that promotes catchment and water management by both statutory agencies and industry. Our research is also informing the development of a harmful algae bloom climate monitoring service through collaboration with the UK environmental regulators, health agencies and water industry \[ **F6**\]. Stirling has generated water quality data from the full Sentinel\-2 MSI archive for 933 UK lakes \(Figure 1\) and since late 2020 is providing weekly data in near\-real\-time through a new web\-based service \( [www.eo4ukwater.stir.ac.uk](http://www.eo4ukwater.stir.ac.uk/)\).

#  4. Details of the impact 

 **Pathways:** From the outset the GloboLakes project appointed an advisory board with key representation from the UK statutory and regulatory agencies, European SMEs, the Group on Earth Observation \(GEO\) and the Joint Research Centre \(JRC; EU Science Hub\). This greatly enhanced our ability to deliver and maximise impact from GloboLakes and H2020 research outputs. Stirling contributed to the development of the *state of the art* of International Ocean Colour Coordinating Group \(IOCCG\) Water Quality Report \(Andrew Tyler was an invited member of the IOCCG Committee, 2014\-2017\), written specifically to highlight the potential of EO for end\-users \( [http://ioccg.org/group/water\-quality/](http://ioccg.org/group/water-quality/)\). The NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellow Claire Neil’s \[ **F5**\] close interaction with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and water utilities has been critical in translating the EO opportunity into impact. The engagement of UN GEMS/Water by Andrew Tyler with GloboLakes \[ **F1**\], European projects \[ **F7,9**\], co\-organised workshops with the India UK Water Centre \(IUKWC\) in Stirling and Kerala \(2017\), and the GEO AquaWatch initiative in Stirling \(2018,  [http://stir.ac.uk/4mu](http://www.geoaquawatch.org/event/geoaquawatch-meeting-joint-with-globolakes/))\) with UNEP GEMS/Water, highlighted EO capability for water quality monitoring in data\-poor regions of the world. 

 **Impact 1 \- Regulatory monitoring of Scottish water bodies:** The Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s \(SEPA\) strategy recognises that new approaches are required to enable communities and businesses to thrive within the resources of our planet by regulating on a sector\-by\-sector basis. To deliver this, SEPA is embracing a digital future to facilitate community engagement, collaborations, and knowledge exchange across sectors to tackle the complex multidimensional challenges of climate change, and deliver sustainable economic growth. Since the start of NERC GloboLakes in 2012, SEPA has been working with the EO team at Stirling in realising the potential of EO capability for water quality monitoring. The H2020 EOMORES project and NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellowship \(Claire Neil\) delivered a step change in the collaboration, adopting the ESA Sentinel 2 platforms to monitor a greater number of inland water bodies. Reflecting the success of this new model of working, enabled by the collaboration with Stirling, SEPA invested in EO capability by appointing Claire Neil to their Team. SEPA’s Ecology Unit Manager, Willie Duncan, states: 

 *‘This* *provided a clear demonstration of how EO can deliver previously unobtainable levels of targeted and efficient water quality monitoring beyond the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. In 2018 Claire Neil was invited to join SEPA’s Remote Sensing Coordination Group. More recently, SEPA created a full\-time post to support the development of its remote sensing capabilities and Dr Claire Neil was appointed to this important role.’* \[ **E1**\] 

 The Covid\-19 pandemic then escalated the need to access EO to support SEPA’s activities: 

 *‘The Covid 19 pandemic resulted in the cessation of SEPA’s routine water quality sampling programme, and this led to an acceleration in the development work that will see satellite derived water quality data being used for environmental assessment purposes and the subsequent sustainable management of natural resources.’* \[ **E1**\] 

 SEPA are now working to embed Stirling’s EO outputs within their day\-to\-day operations: 

 *‘Currently specific applications and internal tools are being developed using outputs generated from University of Stirling projects to assess the impact of nutrient enrichment in lake and coastal ecosystems.’* \[ **E1**\] 

 **Impact 2 \- UK water industry:** Water colour is impacted by changes from in\-water constituents derived from detrital material received from the catchment, or growth of algae in the water body, including potentially harmful cyanobacteria blooms. Our work with Anglian Water, who serve 4,300,000 customers across an area representing 20% of England and Wales, has impacted their Water Resources Management Plan and improved management of their reservoirs. Stuart Knott \(Innovation Discovery Project Manager\) testifies \[ **E2**\]: ‘ *Claire’s fellowship demonstrated for the first time the very real opportunity for Anglian Water to exploit the latest digital technology from satellite\-based EO within the concept of a digital grid to monitor and manage our surface waters’.* Anglian Water have deployed Stirling\-derived EO to fulfil strategic objectives relating to environmental protection: ‘ *Our partnership has allowed Anglian Water to exploit ESA’s Sentinel\-2 images of chlorophyll* a *concentration to identify spatial regions at risk of water quality degradation.’* In relation to reservoir management, Stirling’s data: 

 ‘*facilitate the targeted and cost\-effective treatment of algae in our reservoirs. \[…\] The benefits of these data include a better understanding of blooms over a long period, medium and short time frame. A better understanding of how Anglian’s in\-reservoir mixers can impact blooms. Importantly, this data has enabled us to ask more questions and guide research into reservoir management.’* \[ **E2**\] 

 Covering one third of the UK’s land area, including almost 800 islands and responsible for 8.2% of the UK’s population, Scottish Water acknowledge the challenges and opportunities in monitoring and managing of water and sanitation in their 2020 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan sets out the response to climate change mitigation and inclusive growth opportunities in Scotland. To deliver on this plan Scottish Water is pioneering its research and innovation in partnership with the University of Stirling. In relation to reservoir management, George Ponton \(Head of Research and Innovation\) states: 

 ‘… *as a result of the NERC GloboLakes project and the NERC Knowledge exchange fellow, we have demonstrated that EO can be used to monitor and manage reservoirs to pre\-empt the impact of changing water colour from brownification or algal bloom development. Already we have used this approach to confirm the presence of algae in a drinking water supply reservoir and used the information to inform the operational response to minimise the impacts to our customers.’* \[ **E3**\] 

 Stirling’s EO capability is central to the GBP22,000,000 investment in Scotland’s International Environment Centre from the Scottish and UK Government ‘City and Region Deal’, which is developing a digital twin of the Firth of Forth catchment to drive Scotland’s Green Recovery. Ponton concludes: 

 ‘*To build on this, Scottish Water and the Scottish Funding Council have now invested GBP3,500,000 in the University of Stirling to work closely with Scottish Water and to bring the Scotland’s water sector together and deliver on Scottish Water’s Strategic Plan.*’ \[ **E3**\] 

 Going forward, both Anglian Water and Scottish Water highlight the strategic need and benefit of embedding Stirling’s EO service within their operational monitoring. 

 **Impact 3 \- Global Inland Water Monitoring: filling the gaps where there was no previous monitoring:** The United Nations Environment Programme Global Environment Monitoring System for freshwater \(GEMS/Water\) is mandated to provide the world community with sound quality\-assured data to support water management. The mandate was expanded in UNEA\-3 \(UN Environment Assembly\) through resolution 3/27 in December 2017, acknowledging the growing need for water quality monitoring and capacity building activities. The failure of countries to report their ambient water quality status \(SDG indicator 6.3.2\) affects UNEP’s ability to improve the provision of clean, safe, sustainable water and sanitation \(SDG 6\) strategies, which is fundamental to Agenda 2030, to reduce poverty and end hunger \(SDG1&2\) and to sustain economic development \(SDG 8,9,11&12\) and health and wellbeing \(SDG3\). The need to deliver on these ambitious monitoring goals persuaded UN Environment to exploit the Copernicus Global Land Operations. This impact uses the Calimnos processing chain to deliver water quality products \(e.g. measures of chlorophyll, suspended sediment, turbidity\) for over 4000 lakes globally \[ **E4**\]. This is contributing to the GEMS/Water goals and bringing SDG6 \(Water quality & wastewater monitoring\) back on track. This new satellite capability:

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The efficient and reproducible **oral** delivery of biopharmaceuticals \(i.e., macromolecular drugs, such as proteins\) would revolutionize healthcare, but barriers presented by the intestinal epithelium has limited this possibility.  Fundamental, underpinning research, led by Professor Randall Mrsny at the University of Bath, has now validated and provided proof\-of\-concept for an endogenous, vesicular trafficking pathway used by the bacterial exotoxin, cholix, to overcome these barriers. During the REF period, Applied Molecular Transport, Inc. \(AMT\), co\-founded by Mrsny, has received approximately USD290,000,000 to develop this technology. AMT has a current market capitalisation of more than USD1,100,000,000. 
","
 **2. Underpinning** 

 A safe and efficient method for the oral delivery of macromolecular drugs has been a goal of the pharmaceutical industry since insulin was purified in 1921. Since that time, many more protein \(and peptide\) therapeutics have been identified, with all requiring administration to patients via an injection. Patient convenience and compliance would be greatly increased by an oral dosing approach and would significantly benefit therapy with these drugs. Previous efforts to facilitate oral protein delivery focused on physically altering \(damaging\) the intestinal barrier, which can be problematic for chronic dosing. Underpinning research at the University of Bath since 2014 has focused on examining how Mother Nature solved this challenge; Professor Mrsny hypothesized that non\-pandemic pathogens present in the intestine might secrete agents that could clandestinely overcome this barrier to maintain their residence at this location. 

 Mrsny demonstrated that cholix, a virulence factor secreted by certain strains of *Vibrio cholera,* was capable of efficient transcytosis across an intact intestinal epithelium without modifying its barrier properties. Mrsny \(including Bath research assistants Taverner and MacKay\) subsequently demonstrated that a poorly immunogenic domain of cholix \(lacking all cytotoxic function\) was sufficient for efficient transcytosis and that biopharmaceuticals could be conjoined to this domain through genetic or chemical coupling schemes **\[1\]**. 

 Mrsny went on to identify endogenous elements within intestinal epithelial cells that are used by cholix for its efficient vesicular trafficking that allows it to enter the body. Through these studies, Mrsny identified new biological paradigms related to intestinal pathogen/host interactions and specific mechanisms for how cholix transiently alters the properties of intestinal epithelial cells to allow its transcytosis. A fundamental hallmark of this pathway is that cholix associates with LMAN1 \(a lectin\-binding protein of the retrograde pathway\) to direct it away from the lysosomal degradation pathway and toward the endoplasmic reticulum\-Golgi intermediate complex \(ERGIC\) compartment of the cell. Cholix was also shown to invert cellular distributions of the coatamer proteins COPI and COPII; a result that directed cholix\-containing vesicles to the basal region of the cell as opposed to recycling back to the apical surface. Third, within the basal region of the cell, cholix interacts with heparin sulphate proteoglycan, which is an extracellular matrix protein destined for basal secretion. Through the inversion of COPI/COPII, cholix is released by exocytosis at the basal surface from a recycling endosome\-based pathway. This deep mechanistic understanding of cholix biology has provided the first rational and tractable approach for oral protein delivery. 

 Interleukin\-10 \(IL\-10\) was selected for the first clinical application of the cholix technology. IL\-10 has shown promise in treating inflammatory bowel disease \(ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease\) but has been limited by severe hematopoietic side effects following systemic injection. Professor Mrsny’s laboratory has now shown that a genetic fusion of cholix and IL\-10 efficiently delivers this anti\-inflammatory cytokine to the *lamina propria* of rats and non\-human primates, providing the potential to elicit the intestinal anti\-inflammatory actions desired to treat IBD without the side\-effects associated with IL\-10 following systemic injection. These results have been published in 2020 **\[2\]** and this medicine is now in Phase II clinical trials in patients. 

 Since 2014, Applied Molecular Transport, Inc. \(AMT\) has fully funded two University of Bath postdoctoral research associates, a Ph.D. studentship, and an independent three\-year Fellowship position. Overall, including equipment and overhead, AMT has awarded research funding to the University of Bath of approximately GBP845,000 during the REF period.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The research described above supports the concept that local, targeted delivery can provide effective therapy without systemic exposure thereby ‘opening the door’ to other biopharmaceuticals \(e.g., interleukin\-22 and glucagon\-like peptide \(GLP\)\-2\) that have been unsuccessful in the clinic because of undesirable side\-effects.  Additional benefits of oral biopharmaceutical medicines include avoidance of the cold chain currently required for injectable formulations, the fact that these products do not need to be sterile, significantly reducing production costs compared to injectables \(and eliminating the use of needles and syringes\), and the obvious potential to improve patient convenience and compliance. 

 The chronology of the relevant events and actions relevant to the impact articulated here is presented in Table 1 below.  The Mrsny laboratory at Bath first demonstrated the potential of the cholix transport mechanism *in vitro* using the Caco\-2 cell model. This enabled Applied Molecular Transport, Inc. \(AMT\) to obtain funding of USD5,000,000 to explore the potential of the approach for the oral delivery of proteins to the intestinal *lamina propria*. These resources allowed AMT \- then a limited company that became incorporated in 2016 \- to engage its first four employees and to support further research at Bath. This subsequent work, under Mrsny’s direction, clearly showed IL\-10 transcytosis *in vitro* and *in vivo* and AMT was then able to secure venture capital investments of USD35,000,000 for series A in 2016 and USD77,000,000 for series B in 2018. By 2020, the development programme for cholix\-mediated, oral delivery of IL\-10 had advanced through Phase Ia/Ib clinical trials and entered Phase II **\[A\]**; AMT had grown to 45 employees and, in June, had become a public company \(AMTI \(NASDAQ\)\) **\[B**\]. 

 The CEO of AMT has stated **\[C\]** that the collaboration between the University of Bath and AMT, *“allowed \[the company\] to accelerate studies to validate the basic biological principles at the university while simultaneously advancing the clinical translation through private sector venture capital funding of its pharmaceutical technology… Outcomes from the relationship between AMT and the University of Bath is a clear demonstration that such a strategy cannot only be successful, it can be a new paradigm in delivering impact in the setting of a novel pharmaceutical technology*.”

 The disruptive nature of the cholix technology and the potentially transformative impact of its applications was recently recognized when AMT was selected \(from a field of more than 1,000\) as one of three biotech innovation finalists in the Fierce Innovation Awards – Life Sciences Edition 2020 **\[D\]**.  This is a peer\-reviewed awards program based on the evaluation criteria of effectiveness, technical innovation, competitive advantage, financial impact, and true innovation of a therapeutic.  Wide scientific interest in the cholix technology is corroborated \(for example\) by Professor Mrsny’s presentation of a plenary talk, describing the science behind AMT\-101, at the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation \(ECCO\) held in Vienna in February 2020 **\[E\]**. 

 **Impact 1: Enabling investment and job creation at AMT** 

 The underpinning science performed at the University of Bath enabled AMT to obtain funds for the initial development of the oral IL\-10 delivery system. In June 2020, AMT concluded its initial public offering \(IPO\) of 12,650,000 shares of common stock at USD14.00 per share, generating USD177,100,000. It has a current market capitalisation of more than USD1,100,000,000 **\[F\]**. The AMT head count post\-IPO through the end of 2020 has increased to approximately 100 people. 

 **Impact 2: Informing clinical trials** 

 Venture capital funding to AMT of USD112,000,000 supported development of the oral IL\-10 delivery system \(now known by its codename AMT\-101\) through Phase Ia/Ib clinical testing involving healthy individuals and ulcerative colitis patients, respectively. These studies demonstrated that AMT\-101 is safe and provided evidence for dose selection in Phase II. The significant resources generated by the IPO have permitted AMT to initiate a series of Phase II studies to test AMT\-101 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, pouchitis, anti\-TNF add\-on therapy in ulcerative colitis, and anti\-TNF add\-on therapy in rheumatoid arthritis **\[A\]**.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Collaborative research between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce into gas turbine aerodynamics between 2005 and 2014 has led to a new compressor blade design that is now standard in all modern Rolls\-Royce civil aero engines. The developed elliptical leading edge blade technology has been used in almost 2500 new aero engines delivered since 2014, with a further almost 2,000 engines on order as of December 2019. As well as being part of new engine designs, four older generations of engines have been revised and retrofitted with the technology. For two engines alone, 45 airlines are operating aircraft equipped with this technology. The technology delivers fuel savings of 0.5% to 0.7%, which can be estimated to be delivering savings of USD219,000,000 per year for airlines.

### 1.  Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 There is a long\-standing collaborative research relationship between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce on fundamental research in turbomachinery. The research described below formed part of the University Gas Turbine Partnership with Rolls\-Royce, which was inaugurated in 2001 and incorporates formal processes for technology and people transfer. 

 The compressor of a gas turbine is made up of many blades \(around 4,000 in large civil engines\). The air flow over each blade is highly sensitive to the geometry of the leading edge of the blade, and changes to the geometry of the leading\-edge, and can cause the flow to separate. This separation causes the flow close to the surface to transition from laminar to turbulent and results in a significant detrimental impact on engine efficiency. Small changes in the design geometry, shape perturbations due to manufacturing variability, and in\-service shape changes due to erosion can affect whether or not flow separation occurs, and consequently impact engine efficiency. 

 Computational investigations by Professor Miller in 2004 indicated that an elliptically shaped leading edge on a modern compressor blade could stop the separation that occurred with a standard circular leading edge. This allowed the flow close to the surface to remain laminar, reducing losses and therefore improving engine efficiency. Experimental investigations of the new leading edge profiles confirmed the performance benefits suggested by the simulations. 

 The findings of the experimental investigation, supported by further numerical simulations, were published in \[R1\], showing that by switching from the standard circular leading edge to an elliptical leading edge the flow remained attached, allowing the flow close to the surface to remain laminar.  The mechanisms behind the flow features observed in \[R1\] ere investigated in \[R2\], both experimentally and computationally. It was shown in \[R2\] that the pressure close to the leading edge can exhibit a ‘spike’, and if the spike remains below a critical threshold then the separation does not occur and the engine efficiency will be unchanged. However, if the pressure spike exceeds a critical threshold, flow separation occurs, and the engine efficiency is negatively impacted. Building on the new understanding of the physical mechanisms, \[R2\] also provided design criteria for the shape of the leading edge, allowing designers to determine whether the flow over a given leading edge design would separate or not. Research in \[R3\] extended the understanding to the three\-dimensional case, and investigated the sensitivity to small geometry variations, including surface roughness, at the leading edge. The shape of the leading edge evolves over the lifetime of a blade, and \[R4\] investigated how its design shape can be made insensitive to these changes. Research in \[R3\], through considering the three\-dimensional case, showed that geometric details of the blade design, usually overlooked in the early design phases, are critical factors for overall performance and do need to be considered early in the design process.

### 1.  Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The collaborative research between University of Cambridge Department of Engineering’s Whittle Laboratory and Rolls\-Royce described in section 2 has increased engine efficiency, leading to fuel savings for the airline industry. It has also provided Rolls\-Royce with commercial benefit in a market where engine efficiency is a key differentiator. 

 <ins> **Fuel savings**</ins> 

 The global airline industry fuel bill has been estimated at USD188,000,000,000 in 2019, with fuel costs accounting for 23.7% of airline operating costs \[E1\]. Therefore, small fuel efficiency gains lead to enormous cost savings for aircraft operators and major competitive benefits to engine suppliers. The elliptical leading edge technology developed provides fuel savings of between 0.5% to 0.7% \[E2, E3\]. Based on the industry’s average 12.3 daily hours of utilisation for wide\-body aircrafts and an average fuel cost of USD5000 per hour, a 0.7% fuel use reduction equates to a cost saving of USD157,000 per aircraft per year \[E4, E5\]. For the nearly 1,400 aircraft in service with elliptical leading edge turbine blades, this equates to estimated fuel savings of USD219,000,000 per year that can be attributed to the developed technology. 

 <ins> **Engine designs and deliveries**</ins> 

 The elliptical leading\-edge technology, published in \[R1, R2\], was introduced first in the Trent 1000 engine \(first delivered in 2011\) after being presented to the Trent 1000 design team by Professor Miller in 2004 \[E6\]. All later generation Rolls Royce engines for wide\-body aircraft \(Trent XWB, first delivered 2014; Trent 7000, first delivered 2018\) and the latest generation of engines for business jets \(Pearl 15, first delivered 2018; Pearl 700, first delivered 2019\) were designed with the elliptical leading edge blades \[E6, E7\]. In the period since 2014, Enhanced Performance packs for the earlier generation Trent 500, 700, 800 and 900 engines have been available \[E3\] and include the elliptical leading edge blades \[E6\]. 

 The Trent engines power some of the world’s best\-known aeroplanes, including the Boeing 777 and 787, and the Airbus A330, A330neo, A340 and A380. Over the period 2014\-2020 Rolls Royce delivered nearly 2,500 engines with the elliptical leading edge \(including new designs and updates of earlier models\) \[E7, p.15\], with a further almost 2,000 engines on order as of December 2019 \[E7, p.14\]. Deliveries in the period 2014\-2019, orders at December 2019 and engines in service at December 2019 for wide\-body engines that were designed with the elliptical leading edge blades are summarised in Table 1. Of the 510 wide\-body aircraft engines delivered by Rolls\-Royce in 2019, over 90% \(466\) were designed from the outset with the elliptical leading edge blades \[E7, p.15\]. 

| **Engine** | **Aircraft** | **Year of first delivery** | **Engine deliveries 2014\-2019** | **Engines on order \(Dec 2019\)** | **Engines in\-service \(Dec 2019\)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Trent 1000** | Boeing 787 | 2011 | 667 | 246 | 658 |
| **Trent XWB 84/97** | Airbus A350 | 2014/2017 | 846 | 1,133 | 660 |
| **Trent 7000** | Airbus A330\-800/900 \(neo\) | 2018 | 114 | 576 | 80 |
| **TOTAL** ||| 1627 | 1955 | 1398 |

 Table 1: Deliveries, orders and number in service for the Rolls Royce wide\-body Trent 1000, XWB and 7000 engines equipped with the elliptical leading edge \[E7, p.14, p.15\]. 

 The elliptical leading\-edge technology has been added to Enhanced Performance pack \(EP\) revisions of the earlier generation Trent 500 \(powers the Airbus A340\), Trent 700 \(powers the Airbus A330\), Trent 800 \(powers the Boeing 777\) and Trent 900 \(powers the Airbus A380\) engines \[E6\]. EP packs are retrofitted to existing engines and included with new deliveries of older generation designs. All 216 Trent 900 engines delivered since 2014 \[E6\] have been fitted with the elliptical leading edge \[E2\]. The EP for the Trent 700 has been available since 2009, and over the period 2014\-2019 Rolls Royce delivered 595 Trent 700 engines \[E7, p.15\]. As of December 2019, there are 1,606 Trent 700 engines in operation \[E7, p.14\] and the majority are fitted with the elliptical leading edge. The fuel savings of between 0.5% and 0.7% provided by the elliptical leading edge can be quantified by measuring the efficiency of the Trent 700 and 900 engines without \(original design\) and with the elliptical leading edge blade EP packs \[E2, E3\]. 

 <ins> **Airline operators**</ins> 

 Airlines around the world operate aircraft with engines fitted with the elliptical leading edge. The Trent XWB \(exclusive power unit for the A350\) and Trent 7000 \(exclusive power unit for the A330\-800/900 \(neo\)\) engines alone are operated by 45 carriers as of June 2020 \[E8\]. The Trent XWB powered Airbus A350 was rated in 2017 as the most fuel\-efficient aircraft used on transatlantic routes \[E9, p.9\]. 

 Efficiency is a key differentiator in the aircraft engine industry, and the elliptical leading\-edge technology has helped Rolls\-Royce gain commercial benefit in this market. 

 *“In 2004 Rob Miller spent his summer in Rolls\-Royce investigating the impact of leading\-edge shape on compressor performance. This computational work showed that leading\-edge shape could cause a 20%\-30% change in the profile loss of a blade row. This led to the Trent 1000 project funding testing in the Whittle Lab that showed that leading\-edge shape could change profile loss of a blade row by 24%, and helped to support the Trent 1000 team's confidence that Elliptical Leading Edges should be implemented on the Trent 1000. This is a great example of how the long relationship between Rolls\-Royce and the Whittle Laboratory helps to ensure that technology is successfully transferred into product.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Independent community news outlets play an important democratic role in UK communities left behind by the decline in traditional print media. Cardiff researchers identified challenges faced by this sector, including economic precarity and a lack of training and support. Through the Centre for Community Journalism and the Independent Community News Network \(the UK’s only formal body representing the sector\), the research led to: changes to Scottish and Welsh Governments’ funding of hyperlocal publications, including new sustainability funding during the pandemic; the development of key resources for community news outlets; and growing media literacy across all Welsh primary schools. The team’s training on sustainable community journalism was used by more than 32,000 learners from 131 countries. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Work on community journalism stems from the School of Journalism, Media and Culture’s longstanding research on media and citizenship **\[**e.g. **3.1\]**, tracing the way in which the decline of local and regional newspapers has created a democratic deficit **\[3.2\]**. More recent work explored the potential of a new generation of independent local community news outlets \(currently around 260 across the UK\) to counter this trend. Some of the key research in this case study was funded through the £1.1M AHRC\-funded ‘Media, community and the creative citizen’ project **\[G3.1**, 2012\-2015 **\]** led by Cardiff. Williams was Co\-Investigator \(with Harte from Birmingham City University\) on a project strand on hyperlocal news, where he led on large\-scale content analysis, interview and survey design. 

 **2.1 Value of hyperlocal news** 

 Cardiff research – including the largest content analysis to date of hyperlocal content – established the high civic, community and political value of community news outlets **\[3.3\]**. The team also found evidence of community news playing important social roles, including: providing a route to participation in the public sphere; supporting everyday active citizenship **\[3.4\]**; and directly encouraging and facilitating both online and offline interactions and mutual aid **\[3.5\]**. 

 **2.2 Economic challenges faced by the sector** 

 The research team found that hyperlocal outlets struggle to generate income, making their existence and potential growth precarious **\[3.5\]**. Most are sustained by volunteers and lack the support to expand or professionalise. Only around one in four generate enough income to cover their costs and only a small proportion can pay editors or contributors. Local advertising spend is the dominant form of income generation, but in a competitive and shrinking market **\[3.4\]**. 

 **2.3 Supporting the sector** 

 Williams highlighted the need for systemic intervention to sustain this emerging sector **\[3.2, 3.4\]**. He recommended: 

-  public subsidies for non\-profit local and community news. Once established with initial start\-up funds, outlets could then run on hybrid business models, part\-supported by public money and by targeted hyperlocal advertising **\[3.2\]**; 

-  levelling the playing field in terms of public/government subsidy, which largely shut out newer community outlets in favour of legacy local newspaper companies **\[3.4\]**. 

 Community journalists also lack non\-financial support. A survey \(Williams & Harte for the Media, Community & Creative Citizen project, alongside colleagues from the University of Westminster\) produced the most comprehensive empirical analysis to date of the practices, funding, staffing and outlooks of those who run hyperlocal sites **\[3.6\]**. It showed that: 

-  79% of hyperlocals surveyed would like to expand the size and scope of their site; 

-  63% would like help generating revenues; 

-  42% wanted more technical support; 

-  9% would appreciate legal support when reporting legally sensitive issues; 

-  23% wanted to be able to access training. 

 Wahl\-Jorgensen further investigated – through in\-depth interviews and a survey of practitioners – the sector’s experience during the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[G3.2\]**. She found that the pandemic represents an existential challenge to outlets as they lost significant local advertising revenue and were unable to benefit from government schemes, including furlough and advertising support. 

 Cardiff’s research identified the importance of community journalism and highlighted the challenges facing the emerging sector. Following these findings, Cardiff made two externally\-facing investments to strengthen the sector: 

-  The Centre for Community Journalism \(C4CJ\) was established in 2014 to provide training, support and capacity for the sector, and is a focus for collaborative action\-research with sector stakeholders. As one of the University’s three flagship engagement projects, it was part of a wider strategic investment in transforming communities. C4CJ has since attracted additional external funding \(£300,000\) from the AHRC, Welsh Government and Google. 

-  The Independent Community News Network \(ICNN\), run through C4CJ, was established in 2018 as a formal entity to advocate on behalf of UK community publishers. It is the only representative body for the sector and represents 125 titles \(as of November 2020\) across all four UK nations. Current estimates put the online reach of ICNN membership at over five million people per month across the UK, with a collective circulation of 150,000.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Through the Centre for Community Journalism \(C4CJ\), and the Independent Community News Network \(ICNN\), the research led to: increased advocacy for the sector, resulting in additional income and resource; capacity building for the international hyperlocal sector, leading to new and more sustainable outlets; and critical support to sustain the sector throughout the COVID\-19 crisis. 

 **4.1 Advocacy for the sector** 

 **a. Funding for hyperlocals in Wales** 

 The news industry crisis has particular implications for Wales, where a high penetration of London\-based news creates a serious democratic deficit. Williams and the C4CJ team gave evidence \(2017\-2018\) to the Senedd Cymru \- Welsh Parliament’s year\-long inquiry into News Journalism in Wales **\[5.1\]**. Drawing on our research **\[3.2, 3.5\]** contestable public funding was recommended to help Wales’ hyperlocal sector become sustainable. As a result, Welsh Government provided funding of £200,000, over two years, for hyperlocal publications **\[5.2\]**. The C4CJ team co\-authored a report \(funded by Welsh Government\) on delivering the scheme. ICNN membership was used as a qualifying criterion for access to the Independent Community Journalism Fund and the ICNN team were expert advisors on the application panel. The seven successful applicants are spread across Wales. Their feedback was strongly supportive, including **\[5.3\]**: 

-  *“\[ICNN’s work with Welsh Government\] has been invaluable to me … I had no funding to advertise / promote Inksplott, update the website, update the brand or professionalise the service. With the grant funding received through ICJF, I have achieved all of this... making revenue from advertising more likely in future”* – Lynne Thomas, editor of *InkSplott;* 

-  *“The funding went directly to improving our internal IT infrastructure through the employment of a software developer … \[it\] also went on training, a move to a larger office space and marketing materials”* – Richard Gurner, editor and publisher of *Caerphilly Observer*. 

 **b. Ensuring access to the BBC’s Local Democracy Initiative** 

 In 2016, the BBC’s planned investment of £8m in employing 150 local democracy reporters focused on traditional news providers, taking little account of the community news sector. C4CJ’s advocacy in planning discussions led the BBC to include community\-owned publications in the initiative. Matthew Barraclough, Head of Local News Partnerships at the BBC, confirmed that *“C4CJ was able to represent the needs of the smaller independent news providers to ensure that they could take full advantage of the content generated and \- where possible \- become suppliers themselves”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 As a result, 58 community outlets across the UK now have access to a free daily democracy news wire and four employ a Local Democracy Reporter **\[5.4\]** and news editorial resources can be directed elsewhere **\[5.3\]**. Barraclough further noted that “the establishment of the ICNN was also very helpful to the BBC’s project as, by bringing in common editorial standards and practical support for members, it made it *“easier for a large news organisation such as the BBC to interact and consult with a dispersed and diverse part of the news eco\-system”* **\[5.4\]**. 

 **4.2 Capacity building for the hyperlocal news sector** 

 C4CJ worked throughout the REF period to establish, support and build local news outlets through a sustained programme of training, resource development, advice and outreach. Some examples of impacts from this programme of work include: 

 **a. Web resources:** C4CJ and ICNN resources have helped hyperlocal outlets to survive and grow. For example, access to a suitable web template is a barrier for many wanting to set up a digital news publication. C4CJ created the world’s first free, bilingual, Community Journalism WordPress template. It has been used approximately 100 times to date and over 50% of these uses have been by new start\-ups needing an online platform. Eirwen Williams, publisher of *Pobl Y Fenni*, confirmed that the web template is *“one of the most significant resources we have used”* and that WordPress training provided by C4CJ “ *upskilled our volunteers and saved us thousands of pounds on paying a web designer”* **\[5.5\]**. C4CJ’s advice and digital resources made *Pobl Y Fenni* *“a leading example of how the rest of the Papurau Bro \(Welsh language community newspapers\) can follow in our footsteps…which will help keep this valuable network alive”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 **b. Legal advice:** C4CJ’s free legal advice service for ICNN members has been used approximately 100 times since the network was established in 2018. *The* *Guildford Dragon* said that by using the service *“we have saved money by not having to source costly external legal advice” and “settled legal threats before they escalated”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 **c. Training for the community news sector worldwide:** C4CJ provided training to over 38,000 individuals since 2015. For example, its MOOC on community journalism taught more than 32,000 learners from 131 different countries including India, Brazil, Nigeria, Australia, United States, Russia and Spain. *Inksplott* was one of at least 11 new hyperlocals established as a direct result; its editor confirmed that the course taught her *“both journalism skills…and the technical skills required to set up a hyperlocal news website and social media platforms”* **\[5.3\]**. Ken Skates, then Wales’ Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Infrastructure, wrote: *“the high number of international learners reached through the C4CJ’s Community Journalism MOOC helps to enhance Wales’s reputation in this field”* **\[5.7\]**. 

 **d. Toolkit to develop media literacy in pupils**: C4CJ and ICNN have also contributed to capacity\-building for future generations of journalists in communities across Wales, which *“has been crucial in forming the strategy for boosting Media Literacy across Wales”* **\[5.8\]**. Following a pilot project in a socially deprived community in south Wales, C4CJ developed a media literacy resource for teachers **.** This toolkit, created with the National Education Union \(NEU\) Cymru, was launched across all primary schools in Wales in November 2019. It is a train\-the\-trainer pack of ten hands\-on sessions. Beth Roberts, NEU Cymru, confirmed that the toolkit *“equips pupils with the basics for news reporting, teaches them to examine news critically, and creates the next generation of engaged citizens”* **\[5.8\]**. 

 **4.3 Sustaining community news outlets throughout the Covid\-19 crisis** 

 Community outlets struggled during the pandemic in 2020 as local businesses – their main source of advertising income – closed down. C4CJ and ICNN worked to deliver resilience and sustainability for the sector. 

 **a. Proving status during lockdown** 

 ICNN enabled its members to work unobstructed during lockdown by quickly providing them with letters of verification and membership cards \(most members are ineligible for press cards\). Editor and publisher of the *Guildford Dragon*, Martin Giles said: *“Without this verification, I have no doubt that many journalists would not have been able to perform their roles, this will have been particularly true during the COVID\-19 lockdown”* **\[5.6\]**. 

 **b. Protecting hyperlocals from loss of advertising income** 

 **i. Wales:** At the beginning of the lockdown, C4CJ lobbied Welsh Government to release the remaining money in the Independent Community Journalism Fund. Consequently, all Welsh members of ICNN received £8,000 in emergency grant revenue funding. Richard Gurner, *Caerphilly Observer*, confirmed that *“without ICNN the COVID\-19 funding would not have existed, let alone been reallocated, and without it I believe Wales would have seen some independent media shrink, or even close”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In July 2020, Emma Meese \(C4CJ Director\) gave evidence to the Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament’s Culture, Welsh Language and Communications Committee’s inquiry into the pandemic’s impact on news media. The Committee’s report cited her recommendation to allow hyperlocal and online news outlets to publish statutory notices \[which are currently only required to be published in printed newspapers\] \- a significant source of income **\[5.9\]**. This directly influenced the Committee’s subsequent recommendation that *“The Welsh Government should urgently identify the changes necessary to enable statutory notices to be published by hyperlocal and online providers”* **\[5.9\]**. 

 **ii. Scotland:** Meese, on behalf of ICNN, made similar recommendations in Scotland to ensure that community titles benefitted from Government advertising campaigns. This led to the Scottish government’s agreement to place public health adverts in eight ICNN titles. Following a successful first phase in August/September 2020, ICNN secured a second round of advertising to run for two weeks in November 2020. Edinburgh Reporter editor Phyllis Stephen said that this money *“is absolutely crucial to us as an independent news publisher. We have watched the ‘big boys’ getting support in the form of advertising all across the UK, and thought all was lost until ICNN stepped into lobby on our behalf”* **\[5.10\]**. 

 **iii. England:** ICNN worked to get members access to funds under the Government’s £35m ‘All\-in, all together’ public health advertising campaign. *Wokingham Today*, the only ICNN member publishing a physical newspaper, was partnered with the scheme as a result. The title’s publisher, David Riley, confirmed that: *“This regular stream of income helped us to avoid making any redundancies during the pandemic and to ensure that we could continue to publish in both print and online… \[ICNN’s\] campaigning work over the last six months has been a lifeline to ours and to so many publications across the UK”* **\[5.3\]**. 

 In summary, the Cardiff team developed research findings on community journalism in tandem with vehicles \(C4CJ and ICNN\) designed to maximise their impact, through advocacy, representation, training, advice and resources. This has allowed Cardiff research to play an integral role in ensuring both the survival and the ongoing development of this valuable emerging sector.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Racing the King Tide \( [www.racingthekingtide.com](http://www.racingthekingtide.com/)\) is an international research project that re\-frames the approach to adaptation to sea\-level rise. The first hand experiences of Islanders in Tubigon, Philippines adapting to sea\-level rise \(SLR\) caused by the 2013 Bohol earthquake are documented through film, photography, 360VR and academic publications. 

 The four islands \(total population: 2421\) affected by the continuous flooding have benefitted from impact evidenced at local level through financial aid apportioned for infrastructure changes in raising the classrooms floors and roads on the islands. The project has also influenced policy change at local and national Philippine government level in terms of adaptation to sea level rise and community migration. The project has had significant impact on reframing the international debate on sea level rise and the UN’s intervention in this policy area. The documentaries have been used by the UNCTAD as; 

 “… one of the important resources of interest to stakeholders across the world consulting the website for information, tools and guidance on issues related to climate change impacts and adaptation …”  UNCTAD \[S.10\] 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Racing the King Tide \(RTKT\) is an international research project \[R1,R2\] that investigates the issues of adaptation to sea level rise \[R3,R4,R5 and R6\] and community migration \[R3,R6\] of small islands in the central Philippines. The research focuses on the four low\-lying atoll islands of Ubay \(Population: 223\), Pangapasan \(Population: 623\), Bilangbilangan \(Population: 529\) and Batasan \(Population: 1,046\) who experience severe tidal flooding induced by the 7.2 magnitude 2013 Bohol earthquake. Due to land subsidence as a result of the earthquake, the islands suffer complete flooding during the spring ‘King’ tides \[R1, R2\] \(June, July & August\) and partial flooding throughout the rest of the year. \(Batasan and Ubay: 135 flood days per year, Pangapasan and Bilangbilangan: 44 flood days per year\). 

 **Key research insights or findings that underpinned the impact** 

 The initial research utilized a series of film documentaries \(8 films \[R1, R2\]\) to illustrate the resilience of the islanders to sea level rise \(SLR\) through ‘in\-situ adaptation’. The films document their response to SLR with in\-situ coping strategies thus helping reframe the traditional alarmist narrative of SLR and community migration \[R3, R4, R5 and R6\]. These insights lead us to ‘Rethink the Limit to Climate Change Adaptation’ \[R3\]. 

 The research explores how the islanders have tackled SLR and rather than abandon their homes and communities, they choose to stay through effective in\-situ adaptation rather than migrate. ‘In\-situ adaptation against climate change can enable relocation of impoverished small islands’ \(R6\) and can influence mass migration by reducing vulnerability and increasing the resources needed for successful relocation \(R5\). This research states it is unlikely that dense coastal settlements will be abandoned in the face of sea level rise. Long\-term perspectives about adaptation strategies to SLR are illustrated in ‘Adaptation to Sea Level Rise on Low Coral Islands: Lessons from Recent Events’ \[R5\]. 

 The research project also questioned the impact of immersive 360 documentary as a resource to influence the local Philippine Government’s response to the detrimental effects of natural disaster. A 360 documentary \(played on Oculus VR headsets \[R1\]\) giving voice to the islanders’ experiences was produced and played to the local Philippine government. This immersive documentary allows the viewer to ‘experience’ the impact of the King Tide floods and see first\-hand how the islanders have sought to adapt rather than migrate to the mainland. The research found that there was a more profound experience \(a sense of place\) and enhanced empathy for the islanders through this new innovative form of documentary. The linear documentaries were an important starting point in the project and helped disseminate the narrative at LGU presentations and social media platforms. However, the experiential 360 Documentary gives the viewer an immersive experience where they are actually with the islanders in the submerged waters. This research demonstrates the power of visual communication in shaping the policy debate on a major environmental issue that has both local and global implications. 

 **What research was undertaken, when, and by whom** 

 The research was undertaken from June 2017 during the highest \(King\) spring tides of the year. The documentary films \[R1, R2\] were produced with research colleague Philippine scientist Dr Lau Jamero \(University of Tokyo\) who was the community liaison. Interviews with key contributors on the islands \(Captains, teachers, community nutritionist, marine protectionists and community members\) informed the narrative of the documentaries \[R1, R2\] and journals \[R3, R4, R5, R6\]. Scientific data \(annual flood SLR readings, bathymetry and aerial mapping\) alongside further community ethnographical data \(interviews and focus groups \[S.4\]\) complemented this narrative. The films were published and presented to the Local Government Unit and Islanders in August 2018 and July 2019. The 360 documentary was filmed on the islands in 2019. The immersive documentary experience was presented \[R1. Photography \- VR Headsets\] to the islanders, LGU, the Philippine government \(the Bohol Governor and the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Manager\), NGO’s, and stakeholders in March 2020.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 


**Pangapasan Island:** Teaching school children as water levels rise \(left\) and school children visit the shop at lunchtime in the King tides \(right\). 

 The starting point for the documentaries \[R1, R2\] was to establish a working relationship with the local island communities to ensure that their stories were being told, their voices heard and that they felt a real sense of involvement and ownership of the films. The research team included Dr Lau Jamero \(University of Tokyo\) a Philippine national who had established relationships with the islanders when identifying potential community contributors. This community collaboration with the residents underpinned all of the research work. Output from the film making process was one longer documentary \(YouTube 43,702 views\) and 7 shorter documentaries \(Vimeo – 106,253 views\). 

 **Impact on Local and National Philippine Government** 

 The research was presented to the Vice Mayor, Governors and stakeholders at a Government meeting \(August, 2018\) \[S.1, S.2, R1, R2\]; These initial films were a critical tool in advocating the islanders’ over\-arching narrative to remain on the islands despite the flooding, but they required assistance to implement their in\-situ adaptation strategies. The films had a measurable impact on public policy with recommendations being implemented by Local Government Unit \(LGU\) in Tubigon, Bohol; 

 Sir Noel Cano Mendana, Local Government Unit, Tubigon commented “The research work has helped us a lot in coming up with initiatives that we would like to implement in the islands. The videos, we are showing these to our officials and decision\-makers who help influence decision\-making in providing help and support. The film of kids playing in the flooded basketball court and the classroom inundated with water during class hours has really helped in getting support to provide funding for raising the flooring of the school classrooms \(620,747 PHpesos\). Before, even if teachers are already complaining, it does not generate so much support from the decision\-makers and local officials. These films and the data coming from research, they can really influence people making decisions to implement something that would alleviate the issues and the problems of the islanders after the earthquake.” \[S.1\] 

 Whilst lobbying the local government, the RTKT Teacher’s film \[S.9 \-18K views\] was instrumental in showing the effect that sea\-level rise had on the children on the islands whilst in school ‘Tidal floods distract students from their lessons, bringing human waste and high waves into the classroom’. The lobbying of the Municipality resulted in the propagation of further financial aid \(620,747 PHpesos\) to the islands for infrastructure improvements including raised main roads on the islands so people could still move around in high tides and elevating the classrooms so that the students \(773 children\) could be taught all year round even in high floods. The classroom plans were designed and implemented in Batasan \(2019, \[S.1\]\) by the LGU chief engineer Sir Noel Mendana. He also designed communal toilets with septic tanks \[S.1\] that were installed on Pangapasan where no public toilets previously existed \(2020 Cost: 450,000 Pesos\). The projects were built as a direct response of the LGU seeing our research presentations and viewing the films and 360 documentary. This had significant impact on the population of the four islands with cleaner hygienic communal toilets, raised classroom floors and raised island main roads \(Populations: Batasan \- 1,046. Ubay \- 223. Pangapasan \- 621.  Bilangbilangan \- 529.\) 

 **Impact on the Environment** 

 After the earthquake, many households resorted to coral mining to elevate the floors. Excessive coral mining negatively impact fish population and also endangers peoples’ lives. Corals serve as natural barriers against waves, protecting the island from typhoons and storm surges. Our research, films and discussions with the Municipality and the island communities \[S.4\] have promoted new interventions regarding the problem of tidal flooding \[R3, R4, R5\]. New road building programmes have refrained from using coral stones in order to curb the impact of coral mining in the area \[S.1, S.2\]. 

 Sir Victor Boligao, Local Government Unit, Tubigon said “We now have programs and funding for elevation of road networks, for building seawalls in some of the islands, for raising the floorings of classrooms in the islands so that the water will not enter the classrooms during class hours.” \[S.2\] 

 As a result, new projects on the islands have now made it a point to use stones that have been sustainably sourced from the mainland instead \[R.3\]. The communities are encouraged to build more stilted houses instead which is better for the environment. Through sustainable sourcing of materials rather than mining from the coral reef has resulted in a more environmentally sensitive, effective and safer approach to adaptation to sea level rise. 

 **Impact on International Community** 

 The project \[R1, R2\] has had considerable impact on media coverage of climate change issues via international agencies. The Guardian International \[S.3\] featured the project and films in print and online \(1st February 2019\), the corresponding author Ben Doherty related that the piece was the 3rd most viewed story worldwide upon release. The New York Times featured the project \(February 2020\) in its Philippines Dispatch \[S.3\]. The project had further international reach at the Climate Change Commission in August 2020 \[S.6\]. The 360 films were also played at the British Film Institute \(BFI\) – Future Film Festival in 2018 and 2019 with over 300 participants viewing the film each day within a 6 metre 360 dome \[S.4\]. Engagement events were held at the University of the Philippines in 2020 \[S.4\] which helped with further reach to NGO’s \(Zoological Society of London \(ZSL\), Diocese of Tagbilaran, Tzu Chi Foundation\). 

 The research has had international impact in reframing the argument on adaptation to sea\-level rise. The films were played as part of keynote speeches at the International Conference on Coastal Engineering ICCE \(October 2020 \[S.7\]\) and the ICE Coast, Marine Structures and Breakwaters, Sept 5\-7, 2017 \[S.8\]. The ICCE conference is the most prestigious international coastal engineering conference, held every two years to highlight the leading research in the field. The UK’s Institution of Civil Engineers \(ICE\) Breakwaters conference is the leading coastal engineering conference in the UK, organised every 4 years attracting international experts. The research has therefore been showcased to hundreds of the leading scholars around the world on the subject of coastal adaptation, who are themselves consulted by other practitioners, NGOs and researchers. The research was successful in influencing the views of leading coastal planners and engineers about climate change adaptation, from the idea that communities will gradually retreat to the realization that they will stay in place, and improvise their own ‘in situ’ adaptation to rising waters. 

 The RTKT documentary was utilized as a valuable resource at the United Nations Cop 25 Madrid \(2019\) as part of the digital programme and in the Oceans Exhibition space \[S.5\] The films are deemed to be ‘one of the important resources of interest to stakeholders across the world consulting the website for information, tools and guidance on issues related to climate change impacts and adaptation for coastal transport infrastructure in the Caribbean and in other Small island Developing States’ by Chief, Policy and Legislation Section, Division on Technology and Logistics UNCTAD \[S.10\]. 

 Regina Asariotis \- United Nations Conference on Trade and Development \(UNCTAD\) further added ‘We very much value the extensive collaboration with you and your team on related issues since 2016, issues relating to climate change impacts, adaptation and resilience building for ports and other coastal transport infrastructure in vulnerable developing regions, including your active contribution to our technical assistance project in the Caribbean and to a number of expert meetings, most recently the UNCTAD Expert Meeting on Climate Change Adaptation for Seaports in Support of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, held in October 2020’.

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research from the University of Manchester \(UoM\)’s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research \(Tyndall\-Manchester\) identified the failure of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation policies in the shipping and aviation sectors to align with the Paris Agreement climate targets. The research characterised the impact of this failure, and published decarbonisation pathways that have engaged international, national and local policy and industry stakeholders and influenced debate at multiple scales. 

 Global CO<sub>2</sub> targets have now been set by the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\), through the adoption of resolution MEPC.304\(72\) as a direct result of Tyndall\-Manchester research. In the aviation sector, Tyndall\-Manchester research quantified the extent of technical improvement possible, noting the contradiction between expected aviation emissions growth with the Paris Agreement targets. The Heathrow third runway expansion policy passed by the UK Government was rejected at judicial review because of this inconsistency. The Manchester Climate Change Framework has adopted aviation climate policies because of Tyndall\-Manchester input. This has reduced investment and policy risk for business and local government by recognising this source of emissions in subsequent spatial and economic planning, avoiding the need for late, costly, reactive responses.

##  2. Underpinning research 

 The research on the shipping and aviation sectors generated three key findings that underpin the impact. 

 Paper **\[1\]** identified that omitting international aviation and shipping from the UN’s climate change target framework is a major risk to the 2 °C goal because of the significant climate impact of these emissions. Paper **\[2\]** provided specific insights into the structure and capabilities of the shipping sector, and showed that there are many technical options for decarbonising shipping. For instance, hull and propeller redesign, in combination with speed changes, fuel switching to bioenergy or hydrogen, and wind assistance. It also showed that setting an ambitious target for the shipping industry is not as high risk as it is for aviation. Paper **\[3\]** then quantified the implications of the Paris Agreement mitigation targets for international shipping by relating the IPCC AR5 Synthesis report cumulative emissions budget findings with fleet efficiency trajectories from the reference scenarios of the Third IMO GHG \[Greenhouse Gas\] Study \(2014\), demonstrating the necessity of urgent CO<sub>2</sub> targets. 

 **Finding 1:** **The shipping sector has a similar greenhouse gas emissions reduction challenge as aviation, but with greater potential for technical solutions. It is feasible and necessary to set ambitious CO<sub>2</sub> targets as a matter of urgency.** 

 A sequence of EPSRC funded interdisciplinary projects, conducted by the Tyndall\-Manchester team, explored the challenge of decarbonising international transport. They calculated the expected future emission from the aviation sector following workshops and interviews with industry to assess technical mitigation potential **\[4\]**. The finding of expected rates of emissions increase indicated that demand management and emissions trading deserved greater research and policy attention. The research considered voluntary carbon trading and concluded that this was unlikely to address the matter either. The “tonnes of carbon” included in these trading systems were found not to be physical tonnes of material, and so carbon trading for emissions growth would likely increase the extent of climate change. The research quantified the risk to UK climate change targets if airport expansion continues and demonstrated that as for shipping, leaving aviation outside of the UN’s climate change target framework is a major risk to the 2 °C goal **\[1, 4\]**. 

 **Finding 2: **The aviation sector currently produces 10% of UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and this is likely to increase to levels incompatible with UK and global CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation targets. Technical mitigation potential to cut CO<sub>2</sub> is less than the necessary rate of reduction.** 

 Research funded by the North West Regional Development Agency explored the UK regional distribution of aviation emissions, developing the first methodology for sub\-national apportionment for international aviation emissions **\[5\]**. Further funded work identified the implications of current UK government aviation emissions projections for national carbon budgets and the constraints they place on other sectors **\[6\]**. Unachievable emission reduction rates, greater than 20% *per annum*, were found to be required from the rest of the economy if aviation grows at the rate forecast by the UK’s Department for Transport \(DfT\) and if national climate policy is aligned with the UN Paris Agreement. 

 **Finding 3: **If the aviation sector takes a disproportionate share of future emissions, then the pressure on other sectors may inhibit regional development or jeopardise the overall climate objective.**

##  4. Details of the impact 

###  Context 

 Greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping are largely unregulated. Tyndall\-Manchester research in the period 2003–2007 overturned the prevailing orthodoxy in national climate change mitigation policy that regarded international shipping and aviation as unproblematic, minor sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policy developments followed. The global nature of climate change necessitates a comprehensive emission mitigation framework, since partial coverage will be both physically ineffective and economically inefficient increasing the cost to society. If shipping and aviation are excluded from mitigation efforts then other emitting sectors will be required to go further by, for instance, reducing their economic activity or investing in more costly abatement technology, or suffer damages due to greater climate change impacts. 

###  Pathways to Impact – Shipping 

 In 2009, the need for significant and meaningful CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation targets in the shipping sector was raised with the UK’s Environmental Audit Committee through oral evidence given by Larkin \(then Bows\). Published research papers **\[1, 2, 3\]** and stakeholder engagement at industry and policy events further highlighted the scale of the challenge. This culminated in a submission and oral presentation on carbon budgets made by Larkin and Smith \(UCL\) to the International Maritime Organisation at their Marine Environmental Protection Committee meeting MEPC68 in summer 2015. Smith spoke predominantly about techno\-economic potential in the sector, Larkin focussing on emissions consequences. 

 Tyndall\-Manchester’s research has led the debates that informed European policy decisions and contributed to global scale impact. The European Commission Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety \(ENVI\) in 2016 proposed a new chapter to Directive 2003/87/EC that would include shipping within its Emissions Trading Scheme if not otherwise regulated. This put pressure on the IMO **\[A\]**. This decision was informed by European Commission Policy Department A for the ENVI Committee report **\[A\]** citing paper **\[1\]** for evidence around targets for aviation and shipping. The international NGO  [Global Commission on the Economy and Climate](http://newclimateeconomy.net/about/members-global-commission/), led by the former President of Mexico Felipe Calderon, produced a report **\[B\]** which cites Tyndall\-Manchester’s paper’s ‘50% cut in CO<sub>2</sub> by 2050’, and their *Nature Climate Change* commentary **\[2\]**, with a recommendation that “ *the IMO adopts a global emission reduction target for international shipping…in keeping with 2 °C”*. 

 Larkin spoke prominently on shipping at both the 2015 and 2017 UN international climate negotiations \(COP21 and COP23\), including at an official EU side event alongside Tony De Brum from the Marshall Islands – the leader of the High Ambition Coalition **\[C\]**. At COP21, sector\-specific NGOs cited Tyndall\-Manchester’s research in applying pressure to civil servants and political representatives **\[D\]** and by 2017, there was pressure also from *within* the industry fearing that if IMO did not set a target, the EU would do so instead. The link between UoM’s research and these ongoing policy changes is evidenced by citations of research finding 2 \(above\) in EU **\[A\]**, Pacific Nations’ policy development background documents **\[E\]**, and IMO internal newsletters **\[F\]** at relevant points in time. 

###  Impact – Shipping 

 The UN body responsible for regulating shipping, the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\), adopted ambitious climate change targets at the MEPC72 meeting in April 2018 with preceding discourse influenced directly by Tyndall\-Manchester research **\[D, G\]**. The IMO estimate the resulting emissions reduction to be between 800 and 2,400 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2050, which is greater than preventing all emissions from fossil fuels currently burnt in Germany. The international NGO Transport & Environment’s Campaign Director summarises UoM’s research and evidence contributions, saying, “ *…this work was instrumental in the IMO adopting global emissions reduction targets for international shipping*” **\[D\]**. 

 Action to reduce emissions from shipping is necessary for comprehensive climate change mitigation. If this sector is excluded from obligations applicable to other sectors, then it is much less likely that global warming will be limited to 1.5 °C;  the IPCC identify that up to several hundred million people would be exposed to additional climate related risks and poverty by 2050 compared to 2 °C \(IPCC 2018 SPM B5.1\). The UK Chamber of Shipping’s Director of Policy emphasised the importance of the IMO’s adoption of these targets, saying, “ *This is not only vital work for our industry but also critical in helping to ensure shipping meets its climate change obligations which will be key to the wider global strategy*” **\[G\]**. The reach of Tyndall\-Manchester’s impact on the shipping sector is global due to the adoption of an international 2050 emissions reduction target by the IMO **\[G\]**. 

###  Pathways to Impact – Aviation 

 Based on research findings 2 and 3 \(above\), Broderick and Larkin submitted evidence to the DfT development of the 2019 Aviation White Paper and an expert statement to the judicial review of the approval for the development of plans for a new runway at Heathrow Airport \(Airports National Policy Statement \(ANPS\) 2018\) **\[H\]**. 

 Broderick and colleagues also held a series of workshops \(November 2017 to March 2018\) with the Assistant Director \(Environment\) of Greater Manchester Combined Authority \(GMCA\), representatives of Manchester Airport Group and other stakeholders. The conclusions from these workshops were widely circulated in a report advising GMCA to account for the impact of international transport within their own climate change mitigation framework. Prior to this work, aviation had been considered outside of the city scale, however Tyndall\-Manchester’s research showed that DfT national aviation forecasts resulted in too high a mitigation burden for the GM city\-region. The researchers proposed a new emissions pathway for aviation that was presented to the GMCA Low Carbon Hub board, and as a keynote presentation at Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham’s Green Summit in March 2018. This was followed up with further research and workshops in late 2019 and early 2020 culminating in a report and presentations to Manchester Climate Change Partnership. 

###  Impact – Aviation 

 The reach of the impact on UK aviation policy is at two levels. The first level is the acknowledgement of the comparative scale of DfT forecasts in relation to Paris Agreement carbon budgets. This was particularly highlighted in relation to Heathrow expansion. Following Larkin’s statement **\[H\]**, during the Judicial Review of the ANPS \(2018\), the Court of Appeal in February 2020 ruled that the Government’s ANPS was unlawful because it failed to take into account the UK’s commitment to the Paris Agreement. As of February 2021, Heathrow Airport acknowledge they have to prove expansion is compatible with the Paris Agreement before construction could being. 

 The second impact is at the city\-regional level where the research has helped the City of Manchester to understand the implications of unfettered aviation expansion for their own emissions reductions plans. Manchester City Council, which owns a controlling stake \(35%\) of Manchester Airport, formally endorsed the draft Manchester Zero Carbon Framework \(2020\-38\) in March 2019, which contains analysis that is dependent upon Tyndall\-Manchester’s aviation research **\[I\]**. Subsequently \(Nov 2019\) Manchester Climate Change Agency \(MCCA\) commissioned the Tyndall\-Manchester research team to report on policy options for monitoring and managing emissions from Manchester Airport. Without this research MCCA would not have communicated the importance of aviation emissions at city scale to senior policy makers and stakeholders and achieved the formal adoption of targets and actions for aviation within the city’s Climate Change Framework **\[J\]**. The latest Manchester Climate Change Framework 2020\-25 therefore includes new aviation emissions objectives and was subsequently endorsed by Manchester City Council in March 2020, formally establishing it as the city’s climate change strategy.

 1. **Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\)** 

 Multiple sclerosis \(MS\) is an autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. An estimated 2,500,000 people in the world have multiple sclerosis \(MS Trust\); it affects >100,000 people in the UK and is the commonest neurological cause of disability in adults. Compston and Coles’ research led to the drug alemtuzumab being used by more than 24,000 people in over 70 countries, leading to reduced accumulation of disability and lower risk of developing progressive MS. This in turn allows more people to stay in work, with a higher quality of life, requiring lower drug and healthcare costs. The drug has also had significant commercial impact, generating more than EUR 1.859 billion in net sales. 
","
 2. **Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\)** 

 **Background** 

 In the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, the body’s own immune cells attack and destroy myelin, the covering of nerves, in the brain and spinal cord. This means electrical signals fail to travel down the nerves, causing a wide range of symptoms that can be severely debilitating. These span fatigue, muscle weakness, impaired mobility, reduced vision, bowel problems and more.  Initially these occur as distinct attacks that recover in the “relapsing\-remitting” phase of the disease, which is followed in most cases by the “secondary progressive” phase where people experience continuous worsening of their disability. 

 There is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis, but there are several drugs that reduce inflammation and therefore reduce the attack rate and accumulation of disability. Alemtuzumab, developed by University of Cambridge researchers, is one of the most effective and cost\-effective of these. 

 **Developing Alemtuzumab for the treatment of multiple sclerosis** 

 Alemtuzumab, previously known as Campath\-1H, was made in the Cambridge University laboratories of Cesar Milstein, Herman Waldmann and Greg Winter. Targeting the lymphocytes, a subgroup of the white cells of the immune system, this was the first monoclonal antibody to be used as a therapy in humans. From 1991 to 2013, Alastair Compston \(now retired\) and Alasdair Coles developed this drug as a treatment for multiple sclerosis. The key research since 2000 includes three clinical trials, all led by Alasdair Coles: one phase 2 trial in 2008 \[1\] and two phase 3 trials in 2012 \[2\]. All three showed that alemtuzumab was superior to the standard treatment of the day: interferon beta 1a. In particular, alemtuzumab prevented people from getting more disabled from their MS, and even led to most people experiencing an improvement in their disability. 

 **Investigating the risks and benefits of Alemtuzumab** 

 From 2013, Alasdair Coles and colleagues published research that allowed doctors and people with multiple sclerosis to better understand the benefits and risks of alemtuzumab. Their studies showed that alemtuzumab is more effective than standard treatment at reducing the brain damage caused by MS, seen on MRI scans \[3\]; confirmed that patients’ disability improved after alemtuzumab \[4\]; and that it remains effective for at least five years \[5\]. 

 Importantly, treated patients have the greatest experience of the long\-term benefit of alemtuzumab and have reported this in several ways \(Alasdair Coles led on the 6\-year extension of the pivotal trials and his team also contributed data from the Cambridge cohort to international databases on real\-life experience of multiple sclerosis drug treatment. From these, it is now even clearer that both alemtuzumab \(and another monoclonal antibody, natalizumab\) are more effective than all other MS drug treatments \[6\]. They have also published widely on the side\-effects of alemtuzumab, both the common treatable thyroid disease and the much rarer, more serious side effects of blood clotting problems and kidney disease. 

 In 2019 Coles and colleagues showed \- for the first time \- that early treatment with alemtuzumab reduces the risk of transitioning from the relapsing\-remitting to the progressive phase of multiple sclerosis \[7\].

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 An estimated 2,500,000 people in the world have multiple sclerosis \(MS Trust\), which affects >100,000 people in the UK and is the commonest neurological cause of disability in adults. University of Cambridge research has led to the following impacts: 

 **Impact on policy/guidelines** 

 In 2014, Coles provided evidence and gave expert advice during the NICE alemtuzumab approval process \[A\]. Chief Executive Sir Andrew Dillon said, “We are very pleased to be able to recommend alemtuzumab for adults with relapsing\-remitting multiple sclerosis. Evidence has shown that alemtuzumab is more effective and less expensive than current similar treatments for those with severe relapsing\-remitting MS. The NICE Committee heard from clinical specialists and patients during the appraisal process who described alemtuzumab as a revolutionary treatment for some people, allowing them to live their lives as they had before their diagnosis” \[B\]. 

 Alemtuzumab is now prominent in national treatment guidelines for multiple sclerosis in the UK, including the Association of British Neurologists guidance \(listed as a high\-efficacy drug under recommendations for starting disease\-modifying treatment\), the NHS England treatment algorithm, the European Committee for Research and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis and the European Academy of Neurology guideline and the American Academy of Neurology Practice \[C\]. 

 In 2019 new safety concerns about alemtuzumab emerged, and the European Medicines Agency temporarily restricted the use of alemtuzumab pending a review. Coles advised Sanofi and gave evidence to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in December 2019, following which the restrictions were lifted. The new recommended guidance was issued in February 2020 for safe use of alemtuzumab \[D\] 

 **Impact on health** 

 If multiple sclerosis is not treated, or lower efficacy drugs are used, most patients accumulate disability. However, treatment with alemtuzumab can lead to disability improvement. Data from the latest extension of the pivotal trials \(n=c.800, reported at the 2019 European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis meeting\) shows that nine years after starting alemtuzumab, 49% of patients have improved disability \[2\]. 

 The most important outcome for people with multiple sclerosis is prevention of the secondary progressive phase of the disease, which occurs 15\-25 years after disease onset. Cambridge research showed that first\-line treatment with alemtuzumab lowers the risk of developing secondary progressive disease over 8 years from 41%, if untreated, to 21%. Of patients treated with alemtuzumab or two other powerful drugs \(fingolimod, natalizumab\), 16% had entered the secondary progressive phase at 9 years, compared to 27% on interferon\-beta. Therefore, of the approximately 25,000 patients currently treated with alemtuzumab, 2,750 people will have been prevented from developing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, compared to standard treatment. In accord with this, quality of life measures improve with alemtuzumab treatment of multiple sclerosis \(see below\) \[E\]. 

 Alemtuzumab is very convenient for patients, who require five daily infusions at baseline and three daily infusions a year later. Over the eight years since its use in patient treatment, approximately half of the 369 patients originally enrolled in trials have required no further treatment \[F\]. There are potentially serious side\-effects of alemtuzumab, but most can be managed safely. 

 As of November 2019, over 25,000 people with MS have been treated with alemtuzumab \[Sanofi\] and the drug is licensed and reimbursed over 70 countries worldwide \[G\]. The greatest use is in Europe and Northern America \(as these are the regions with the highest incidence of multiple sclerosis\). The UK is the highest prescribing country of alemtuzumab, *pro rata*. 

 **Commercial impact/impact on economy** 

 In 2012 Campath was acquired by Sanofi, a global pharmaceutical company. In September 2013, alemtuzumab was licensed in the UK since when it has been licensed in over 70 countries, including the EU and United States \[F\]. Since licensing, annual sales of alemtuzumab have steadily increased, generating net sales income between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2014 and 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019 of EUR1.859 billion \[H\]. 

 Alemtuzumab, and the other high efficacy drugs, double the chance of improvements in amount of work, work attendance and work productivity by people with multiple sclerosis \[I\]. Alemtuzumab is an expensive drug, but because it is given so infrequently and has such a prolonged action, its cost compares favourably to drugs of a similar class. In Austria, alemtuzumab use saves EUR 60\-100,000 in drug costs per person treated over ten years. In the US, between USD 450\-600,000 is saved for each person treated over 20 years \[J\]. 

 In 2014, NICE judged that alemtuzumab was the most cost\-effective treatment for MS compared with other available immunosuppressant drugs, giving incremental cost gain \- of GBP13,600 \- 24,500 per quality\-adjusted life year \(QALY\) compared with glatiramer acetate and GBP8,900 per QALY compared with fingolimod, both alternative MS treatments\[A\]. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health found that “over a 20\-year time horizon, alemtuzumab dominated all other alternative treatments, i.e. it was both more effective and less costly” \[J\]; the same conclusion was reached by Hamidi et al \[J\]. In Italy, over the lifetime of someone with multiple sclerosis, alemtuzumab is more cost effective than similar drugs and also leads to an incremental benefit of 1 QALY per person \[J\]. Finally, a similar study in the US showed lower cost and higher QALY gains from alemtuzumab, compared to any other MS drug \[J\].

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 *Seven Songs for a Long Life,* directed by Amy Hardie, is a feature\-length documentary film that pioneers the use of creative activities in approaches to palliative care. It was screened to audiences in over 250 cinemas in 15 countries, and at 160 community\-organised screenings in the UK from 2016\-2020. Hardie’s award\-winning film challenges the notion that palliative care represents ‘the beginning of the end.’ It has benefited patients and their families by introducing music and song as means of support; influenced charities, the media and the general public by raising awareness of issues and experiences of palliative care; and has informed approaches to palliative care, education and training, including through the NHS. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2011 Amy Hardie of the Scottish Documentary Institute \(SDI\) was approached by Strathcarron Hospice to become filmmaker in residence, based on her reputation for generating public engagement with healthcare through filmmaking. SDI is a hub for filmmakers based at Edinburgh College of Art with an international reputation for producing innovative documentaries and a commitment to supporting work that is socially aware and driven by emotional experience. 

 Hardie began making *Seven Songs for a Long Life* \[3.1\] \(henceforth *Seven Songs*\) by working with families where one parent was not expected to live beyond six months. Working mainly with the children, she developed a series of film games incorporating filming and screening at home or in a hospice, which explored the potential of the camera as a channel of communication between family members, creating an intimate record of their shared experience. These led to a new creative collaboration with families and hospice staff to answer a fundamental research question: *How can we use film/music to enable us to take control of the last years or months of our lives, and make our inevitable deaths our own?* Hardie’s approach to answering this question was based on principles of co\-creation and innovative notions of the relationship between the documentary filmmaker, subject and audience. Workshops and screenings of rough cuts of footage involving participants and their families and carers were used throughout to inform next steps in filming and editing, leading to close, collaborative interactions. 

 This approach reflects the concept of ‘expanded cinema’, which rejects the one\-way ‘broadcast’ relationship between the screen and its audience in favour of a more dialogical approach \[3.2\]. *Seven Songs* continues a previous line of Hardie’s research into expanded cinema, developed during work on her first feature documentary *The Edge of Dreaming* \[3.3\]. In making *Seven Songs*, the power of visual storytelling and collaboration with subject and audience was explored throughout the production process, from background research and planning through to filming and editing. 

 The filmmaking process began in 2012 with family workshops, where the camera and resultant short films were used as a channel of communication within families, and between families and healthcare professionals at a time of acute stress. 50 short films were made for and by patients and staff during Hardie’s residency. Some of these became music films as patients chose to sing rather than talk to the camera; the resulting feature\-length film *Seven Songs* \[3.1\] ultimately took the form of a ‘documentary in song.’ Supported by a musically trained staff nurse, Hardie worked with patients to tell their stories in song. Song choices were made by patients, and Hardie brought in a professional singing coach to give patients the confidence to achieve their ‘best voice’, which would remain after their death as a legacy to future generations. Rough cuts of *Seven Songs* were screened in the hospice, with formal and informal discussions providing feedback to the filmmaker. Making the film was thus an explorative, co\-created process, with the filmmaker adapting her approach according to patient and staff feedback. The making of Seven Songs was supported by GBP305,000 in external funding \[3.1\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 The making of *Seven Songs* provided palliative relief to the project’s participants. The film itself has raised public awareness and changed perceptions of palliative care, and informed the work of hospices, charities, and healthcare education and practice. This was achieved through cinema screenings locally and nationally as well as a post\-screening workshop which encouraged discussion of end\-of\-life among patients, their families and the general public. As a senior staff member at the University of Edinburgh Medical School puts it: “ *this film is something different. It helps talk about uncertainty which actually most doctors and nurses are much less trained for*.” \[5.1\] 

###  Palliative relief for patients 

 Statements from Strathcarron Hospice patients and staff testify that Hardie’s approach to filming led to palliative relief. Participants praised the project as *“absolutely amazing”*, *“very relaxing”*, *“something to look forward to”, “good fun”* and a *“marvellous, marvellous comforter”* for relatives. Patients also noted the sense of acceptance that came from seeing themselves on film: 

 *“I didn’t really see myself like that until I saw it on the film… And I think in a way I thought it was quite good because I thought, well, it’s like an acceptance.”* \[5.2\] 

 The project created a collaborative legacy for families, capturing elements of everyday life as well as special moments the families chose to record: 

 *“My family… they really liked it. I think secretly they know that they can still have Mum on it when I’m not here, so it’ll be good.”* \[5.2\] 

 The Palliative Care Research Network newsletter \(February 2016\) reported that Strathcarron patients valued the opportunity “ *to tell their personal story, to be seen as strong individuals … and not just weak and vulnerable patients*.” \[5.3\] 

###  Raising public awareness and changing perceptions of palliative care 

 *Seven Songs* was screened to audiences in over 250 cinemas in 15 countries, and at 160 community\-organised screenings in the UK. It has been invited to over 40 international film festivals and conferences and was nominated for five awards in 2016, including Best Single Documentary at the Scottish BAFTAs \[5.4\]. It had a higher than average \(9%\) audience share for its UK transmission on BBC Two Scotland, with a terrestrial audience of 101,000 in Scotland \[5.5\] and screened on the national US public television network PBS 1,401 times up to November 2017 \[5.6\], accompanied by a dedicated website which included downloadable educational resources. In May 2016, the film was screened at 14 events with accompanying workshops around the UK as part of Dying Matters Awareness Week \[5.6\]. 

 There was extensive coverage of the film in the press in the UK and overseas – including four\-star reviews in The *Guardian* newspaper and *Total Film* magazine, and a recommendation as one of the best films of the year in *Vulturehound* magazine \[5.7\] – demonstrating the positive reception the film received. A dedicated campaign on social media \[5.5\] for the film’s premiere in September\-October 2015 generated 6,249 views of the film’s trailer and accompanying videos on YouTube; 144,700 impressions on Twitter; and Facebook posts which regularly reached over 4,000 people. *Seven Songs* was included in highlight features for the SXSW 2016 line\-up in press including *IndieWire* and *Variety* magazine, and REM posted about the film’s PBS transmission on their Facebook page, which has around 4.4 million likes: “ *an awesome documentary… A special shout out goes to Mandy, the nurse who sang the duet of ‘Everybody Hurts’*” \[5.7\]. 

 Post\-screening evaluations undertaken by Hardie in conjunction with UoE’s Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy \(SCPHRP\) showed how the film changed public perceptions about planning for end\-of\-life and palliative care: 86% of those surveyed at screenings of the film came to the realisation that hospice care can be part of life, and 96% stated that they would recommend *Seven Songs* as a resource for helping others approach a terminal diagnosis \[5.8\]. 

###  Enhancing the profile of the work of hospices and palliative care charities 

 44 screenings in hospices around the UK \(including in partnership with Hospice UK for Hospice Care Week 2015\) were each accompanied by workshops exploring ideas around end\-of\-life and training resources \[5.6\]. Some of the Strathcarron patients who feature in *Seven Songs* took part in a roadshow of Q&A sessions alongside these screenings, reflecting on the experience of filming, the idea of leaving a legacy and of accepting change. 

 Partnerships were formed with 11 UK and 13 international palliative care charities, through which the film was offered as a tool to facilitate dialogue around end\-of\-life within their networks and with the wider public through screenings and events. These engagement opportunities contributed to raising the profile of these charities and the services they provide. Hospice UK confirmed that: 

 *“This film tells the story of joy and honesty even in the face of serious illness and impending death. It shows the power of attentive and flexible hospice care to help people reconnect to what matters in their life – whether it is music, memories, families or simple everyday things. The power of patients bursting into their favourite song is startling and the film captures these poignant moments unselfconsciously and tenderly”* \[5.9\]. 

###  Informing healthcare education and practice 

 In line with the Scottish Government’s Strategic Framework for Action on Palliative and End of Life Care, medical professionals and educators have used the film to encourage discussions around end of life. Healthcare Improvement Scotland notes that: 

 *“Giving health and care professionals and members of the public access to the stories of real people as portrayed powerfully in ‘Seven Songs for a Long Life’ enables people to have greater understanding about the benefits of Anticipatory Care Planning which is essentially about individuals and those who are supporting them thinking ahead.”* \[5.10\] 

 The film can be used within the NHS as part of nursing continuing professional development \(CPD\) and revalidation \[5.11\]. The Queen’s Nursing Institute Scotland identified the importance of *Seven Songs* in the relationship that nursing staff build with patients: 

 *“For me as a nurse, this is a really powerful film. Being alongside people and their families at the end of their lives and sharing that journey is the most incredible privilege… Being present as a fellow human being, as a companion, sharing the moments of joy and the pain. That is the essence of nursing and ‘Seven Songs for a Long Life’ portrays this with tenderness and sensitivity.”* \[5.11\]

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Records of Early English Drama North\-East \(REED\-NE\) has raised public awareness of, and encouraged active involvement in, North\-East England’s cultural heritage. Engaging and developing a large team of community volunteers and creative practitioners, the project has staged multiple significant dramatic events showcasing regional traditions thought lost, while sharing skills, refining historical knowledge, and inspiring diverse audiences. The principal impacts have been: **Revival** of a lost dramatic heritage and reinvigoration of live regional traditions. **Participation** of local community volunteers and creative artists \(including musicians, dancers and puppet\-makers\), resulting in skill sharing and development, and demonstrable wellbeing benefits. **Inclusion** of varied audiences from across the North East, in part facilitated by theatrical interventions using striking puppetry, leading to increased interest and participation in local cultural heritage, especially its intangible musical and performance elements. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 REED\-NE has been driven by a ‘research in practice’ approach, through which productions of early music and drama from the North East \(much of which had not previously been performed in modern times\) have been made available to contemporary audiences via a team of community volunteers and creative practitioners. Previously, research in these areas had been London\-centric and preoccupied with commercial theatre; REED\-NE has redressed this imbalance by drawing attention to many neglected forms of anonymous and/or collective performance in regions hitherto regarded as ‘marginal,’ demonstrating that early performance in the North East was lively and diverse. Testing the theoretical assumptions of research against practical performance conditions, project productions have uncovered the many hidden historical dimensions, the artistic power and the enduring vitality of regional drama. REED\-NE is part of a substantial international undertaking to collate all surviving sources for medieval and early modern drama in Britain. By providing detailed evidence of performances and their social, cultural and economic implications, international REED volumes have revolutionised scholarship regarding British theatre history, with the Durham\-led project specifically charting the North East of England \[R1\]. An international research team gathered evidence over five years, through painstaking work in archives, libraries and public and private repositories nationally and internationally. REED\-NE has traced and published an estimated 10,000 records pertaining to drama, music, dance, festivity and ceremonial, from the earliest sources \(8\-9th century\) to the onset of the English Civil War in 1642. This includes manuscripts containing medieval mystery plays, accounts of rites customary in Durham Cathedral, and evidence of popular entertainment such as medieval stag ceremonies and May games. All evidence is available in open access format online \(Records of Early English Drama and Patrons and Performances, hosted by University of Toronto\). REED\-NE’s transcriptions, translations, ample commentary and glossary of unfamiliar terms all maximise accessibility and enable user\-friendly searches with built\-in visualisations and guides; individuals can perform their own North East\-focused enquiries and see nationwide links \[R1\]. Publications reflecting on this work of recovery and renewal have addressed medieval and Renaissance theatre, ceremony, music, dance, textiles, attitudes to theatre, patrons and performers, and the revival of dramatic heritage \[R2\-R6\]. Project doctoral students Jakovac and Beckett researched Catholic entertainment and laughter in medieval drama; McKinnell investigated the Anglo\-Saxon Lindisfarne Harrowing of Hell \(written before 750AD, therefore Britain’s oldest surviving play\) and the Durham Song, a Tudor musical fragment connected with festivities in old Durham which inspired creative artists including Igor Stravinsky and Dylan Thomas. REED\-NE’s research has shed light on hitherto poorly represented dramatic practices, including folk traditions, religious processions and illegal Catholic drama, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of British, and indeed global, drama and pageantry. Further, via volunteers and collaborating creative practitioners, many such traditions and practices have been resurrected and restaged, bringing project research alive for, and with the participation of, the communities to which they originally belonged.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 REED\-NE’s research\-driven revival practices have engaged new audiences in celebrating early drama, music and legend from England’s North East, via strategies of community involvement and creative artist development. The project has used striking instances of puppetry and pageantry to return practices uncovered in documentary research to the people of the region, in turn prompting media coverage and an expanding audience for, and participation in, future events. Traditions in the performing arts, social practices, rituals and festivals are assets of ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage’ as defined in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s \(UNESCO\) 2003 convention, fostering ‘a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity.’ REED\-NE afforded local communities first\-hand experience of lost musical and dramatic traditions, enhanced the skills and wellbeing of project volunteers, and developed the practice of participant creative artists. The project has a lasting and sustainable legacy in the region, continuing to shape the cultural heritage of the North East. Impact occurred in three main areas: revival, participation and inclusion. 

####  REVIVAL: ‘Research in practice’ and diversifying audiences 

 Building on previous research\-based performances with amateur theatre groups in 2000 and 2010, where the benefits of such staging for the performance elements of research and to the region were first realised, REED\-NE embarked on an ambitious series of public events – over 55 since 2016 – including talks, workshops, community courses, an exhibition in Durham Cathedral and, most significantly, an international theatre festival and a series of plays and concerts. From 2016 onwards, Ravelhofer’s work on early dance, music and costume \[R5\] informed research\-led productions reflecting local traditions such as Durham’s medieval Boy Bishop, as well as pan\-European phenomena such as the danse macabre or ‘dance of death’. Team research on music and medieval performance conventions, as well as material culture including textiles \[R2\-R4\] enabled the team to stage in 2016 the *Lindisfarne Harrowing of Hell* and *Peregrini* \(c.1150\) by Lawrence, a monk at Durham’s former Benedictine monastery, at the *Theatrum Mundi* festival \(Durham, July 2016\) which also included a conference and exhibition \( *Festive Traditions in the North\-East of England*, Durham Cathedral, between April and May 2016; seen by approximately 40,000 visitors\) \[E1; E4\], a street pageant, and 12 further productions. *Peregrini* and the *Harrowing of Hell* were staged alongside *The Sacred and the Profane*. The *Theatrum Mundi* festival attracted a live audience of approximately 1,500 people; online viewers number 4,050 \[E1; E7\]. To bring these revivals to the stage, the REED\-NE team collaborated with professional choreographers, dancers, musicians \(e.g. York Waits\) and musicologists, as well as costume designers and textile historians of international standing, from Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the London School of Historical Dress \(with Hollywood and Globe Theatre experience\) in order to realise productions of the highest scholarly and professional standards. Volunteer participants were thus exposed to top\-class research and performance practice that would normally have been inaccessible to them. In turn, the research team found they had to update cherished theories from volunteers’ feedback and the realities of a staged production \[R5\]. Enlivened by those volunteers and public audiences, the productions allowed participants insights into performance as embodied heritage \[E1; E4\]. As of December 2020, REED\-NE productions, which consistently sell out, have attracted an estimated total live audience of approximately 44,000 people. Approximately 54,000 online visitors from 136 countries have accessed the website, and 7,254 people have viewed the project’s productions and podcasts on YouTube, Facebook, or the project website \[E1; E7\]. REED\-NE’s main beneficiaries have been regional, both institutions and individuals, including: Durham Cathedral and World Heritage Site, Hexham Abbey, Brancepeth Castle, Durham Embroiderers’ Guild, Twisting Ducks Theatre Company \(Morpeth\), Phenix Studios \(Hexham\), the Gillespie Brothers folk musicians \(Northumberland\), Society of Folk Horror Whitby, and Kirk Merrington Primary School, County Durham \[E1; E3; E6\]. Events involved participants from a wide range of contexts, including: school children, teachers, students, interns, church congregations, community groups and individuals practising music, crafts and drama; local professionals in arts and design; and performers, including those with disabilities \(see below\). They attracted a broad public audience, made up of both local people \(an average of 49%\) and students or visitors \(an average of 34.5% of people\), who may have an existing interest in performance or regional traditions, or may gain one through attending. For example, the show *Souls of the North at Durham Castle* \(Between September and November 2018\) attracted approximately 250 people, many of them repeat visitors. Over 87% of attendees learnt more about regional traditions; 98% wanted more such events \[E1; E5\]. 

####  PARTICIPATION: Sharing skills between volunteers, creatives and researchers 

 REED\-NE is dependent on public audiences, creative practitioners and a large number of volunteers in addition to the research team, and has had notable success in attracting audiences to volunteer for future productions, engaging them in the dramatic traditions of the North East, increasing opportunities for project legacies, and enhancing individuals’ skills, wellbeing and social involvement. Since 2016, approximately 200 volunteers have made the project’s events possible; well over 60 have repeatedly performed in these shows. Regularly, between 50% and 60% of public audience members wish to take part in future events; many go on to become volunteers \[E1; E4\-E6\]. For those volunteers, the experience is enriching. Most obviously, they learn about performance traditions belonging to their region, but they also hone motor, social and intellectual skills: from learning to speak and move more confidently in public, to costume\-making, Renaissance dances, playing an unfamiliar instrument, or event management. They report increased confidence and widening skill sets \[E6\]. *Open Atelier* in Durham \(June\-July 2016\) with London’s School of Historical Dress offered free tailoring workshops to the public, attracting members from the Durham Embroiderers’ Guild, who subsequently volunteered to produce costumes for REED\-NE shows \[E1\]. At Kirk Merrington, 30 schoolchildren aged 8\-12 were introduced to early dances. For their teacher, the workshop ‘enabled the period to be brought to life for the children in a way that I was not able to do’ \[E3\]. 3 girls went on to perform in the theatre festival in 2016 \[E4\]. *Strictly Come Renaissance Dancing* workshops \(between February and March 2016\) attracted 127 participants from a 75\-mile radius; approximately 10% of people subsequently became volunteers, remarking: ‘There is an emotional response to the steps, rhythm and music of the period that created a different me for a short time,’ and ‘I can’t dance well, but now I want to’ \[E1\]. 

 The *Theatrum Mundi* festival included volunteers aged 10\-70, approximately 30% of whom have gone on to participate in later project productions, giving feedback including: ‘Performing on a stage was incredible. Since I was a small child I had always wanted to dance on stage and here, in Durham, I fulfilled my ambition\! Thank you\!’ \[E1\]. One volunteer learned to play a new instrument: ‘I would never have done that otherwise; \[it\] absolutely built my confidence’ \[E6\]. Events appeal to an audience across a wide age range ‘I’m 12 years old and I want in on this’ \[E1; E5\], in turn driving a diverse range of volunteers. In addition, the project’s creative collaborators develop their own skills and career plans. A Hexham crafts specialist benefited from increased exposure to regional heritage and hands\-on involvement in theatricals: ‘having access to people and ideas really changed my approach; I’m an absolute introvert so having to perform \[…\] pushed me’ \[E6\]. Professional folk musicians from the region enlarged their repertory: ‘It’s a demonstration of love and confidence in the area that it’s worth researching – as opposed to silence which carries the implication that there is nothing worthy in the local past; such care is very powerful’ \[E6\]. REED\-NE, by seeking audience feedback and participation, has generated an ever\-increasing range of volunteers keen to ensure the survival of these reinvigorated local traditions; these volunteers develop their own practical, social and intellectual skills through working with experienced professionals and researchers. The result is a living body of revivalists, intimately engaged in the dramatic traditions of the North East. 

####  INCLUSION: Theatrical interventions to engage new audiences 

 REED\-NE has pioneered the use of puppet\-led dramatic interventions in public performance, using striking creatures to generate the interest of public audiences across a large age range, attract volunteers and drive media coverage of project events. A central example of this practice is the Durham Dragon, a substantial stage\-prop that requires several people to manoeuvre, which has drawn in audiences, encouraging them to learn more about aspects of their intangible heritage, and to delve into project research \[E1; E2; E4\]. Research had uncovered a reference to a 16ft\-long, ‘very greate, strange & monstrous’ dragon, brought to Durham in 1569 by an unnamed Italian mountebank \(parish register, St. Nicholas’s Church Durham, County Record Office EP/Du.SN 1/2\). Inspired by this record, local artists Phenix Studios created a research\-informed stage dragon for REED\-NE, using techniques and materials that would have been available in the 16th century, although \(given the lacunae about the creature’s physique\) exercising artistic freedom and incorporating white scales, eyes from a Sunderland glass factory and an appealingly sullen expression. The Dragon ties the project’s research findings to the North East’s abundant dragon lore \(indeed Lewis Carroll’s *Jabberwocky* is inspired by the local Sockburn worm\), and it has also become a local mascot. Borrowed by enthusiasts, it tours Durham at Halloween, and has made guest appearances at the Washington Carnival pageant \(17 Sept 2016\), the ‘Festival of Ideas’ at the University of York \(9\-10 June 2018\) with several hundred in attendance, and the Morpeth *Gathering*, an annual parade \[E1\]. In addition, the Dragon assisted in the diversification of project audiences, since it revealed how puppetry helps individuals on the autistic spectrum overcome social difficulties. REED\-NE collaborated with Phenix Studios and the theatre company Twisting Ducks \(‘Changing Lives Through the Arts’\), which caters for artists with special needs. A puppeteering workshop in which the Dragon appeared improved the confidence of 5 autistic participants and enabled them to march in the Morpeth *Gathering*, applauded by thousands \(27 April 2019\). Participants stated that ‘I am sometimes nervous and have a lot \[of\] anxious \[feelings\] about meeting new people but I had a clear role to do which made me really confident to go up to new people,’ and that ‘I learned lots of skills and loved the history and stories of yesteryear’ \[E1; E2\]. For the workshop’s leader, REED\-NE opened a new career opportunity: ‘I’m now a professional puppeteer which came out of this, surprisingly \[…\] now \[I’m\] an assistant director at \[Newcastle’s\] puppetry festival for next year’ \[E6\]. For a diverse audience, then, puppetry and pageantry increased participation, changed attitudes toward dramatic heritage in the region, developed participants’ confidence, careers and skills, and generated media interest \[E1; E2; E3; E5; E6\], in turn driving volunteer recruitment, securing the project’s ongoing cultural impact. 

####  PROJECT LEGACIES: Intangible heritage renewed 

 REED\-NE leaves a substantial legacy of research and revival, and a significant body of local volunteers and creatives keen to continue reinvigorating the North East’s traditions, a ‘demonstration of love and confidence in the area,’ \[E6\] as those participant folk musicians put it. After project involvement, a group of Northumberland artists decided in summer 2020 to found Hazelsong Theatre Company to celebrate regional performance traditions using, among other sources, REED\-NE’s research. Following the impact of Covid\-19 on the national and regional economy, and the particular impact on performing arts, REED\-NE presented a potential avenue to recovery in the region. The research team, local artists and local stakeholders submitted a bid to the AHRC’s Follow on Fund scheme \(November 2020\) that capitalises on the project’s findings in order to boost regional heritage and make local sites more economically resilient after the pandemic \[E6\]. Hexham Arts Centre stated: ‘people respond best to their heritage when it is brought to life \[…\] the project will provide a unique window into the dramatic heritage of the region.’ Ripon Cathedral sees REED\-NE and its follow\-on project as an opportunity ‘to move beyond traditional mediums to engaging creative, immersive experiences that will create an impression for participants long after the project ends.’ For Morpeth’s *Gathering* committee, REED\-NE’s events ‘inspired us to continue to plan future community activities,’ such as ‘puppetry and community involvement with people of all ages and abilities.’ Further, they stated that REED\-NE’s continued work would ‘enhance and refresh Morpeth’s long\-standing festival’ and ‘would contribute hugely to the community’s sense of identity and appreciation of our shared cultural heritage’ \[E6\]. For Brancepeth Archive Group, ‘this joint venture proved exactly the value of reaching out into the community and involving the general public, as well as local groups such as ours \[…\] long may it continue’ \[E1\]. Through drawing together researchers, public audiences, volunteers and creative practitioners; using strategies of audience\-to\-volunteer conversion; and making significant dramatic interventions in the region via research\-informed puppetry on a large scale, REED\-NE has developed the skills of a volunteer base, brought together local stakeholders, enriched creative careers, and revived interest in regional drama and performance, with long\-term personal, social and cultural impacts.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Davey and Taithe’s body of research has produced one of the first historical analyses of the emergence and development of the humanitarian aid sector and historicised its practices. It has, for the first time, brought historical analyses into the strategies and training of two of the four largest Nobel Prize\-holder global humanitarian organisations, Médecins Sans Frontières and Save the Children \(more than 60,000 humanitarians worldwide\), allowing critical humanitarian histories to inform humanitarian futures. Their historical expertise has been deployed in the humanitarian sector and contributes to research and policy agendas for INGOs, funders and standard\-setting organisations, shaping the entire humanitarian sector. This has integrated historical thinking in accounting for ongoing work. It also impacts on record keeping and archiving practices. The research also contributes to reshaping the educational agenda of global humanitarian agencies. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Taithe’s late\-1990s work on humanitarian history was a vital precursor to what is now a dynamic field of enquiry. Taithe works primarily on historical consciousness in the humanitarian sector and the shaping of epistemic communities in humanitarian practice. The research explores the genealogies of aid, looking at missionary genealogies, colonial encounters and forms of humanitarian governance \[1\]. Most recently, the research has been integral to the development of a policy\-relevant investigation of pre\-1912 practices of fundraising and accountability within the charity and humanitarian sectors \[2\]. Taithe’s current research on Cambodia involves the development of new archival practices for humanitarian archives and historical analysis of ongoing medical work on hepatitis C. 

  

 Davey \(University of Manchester, May 2014\-October 2019\) previously held a position at the DFID\-funded think tank Overseas Development Institute \(ODI\), where she specialised in the relevance of history for humanitarian policy and practice. Her research emphasises the evolution of public debates in which humanitarian agents participate, highlighting the important role played by political agendas and the interface between human rights, international aid, and domestic activism \[3\]. Davey’s research has brought an original history of ideas approach to humanitarian studies, countering a tendency to focus on institutional archives and related methodologies. 

 Taithe and Davey’s research has focused on tracking the dynamic origins of humanitarianism, the professionalising dimension of the sector and key ideas that have shaped how humanitarianism has grown as an applied practice. Methodologically this research stresses knowledge co\-production \[4\] with users and practitioners as a method of historical enquiry. It invites a growing awareness of the uses of history, archives, and ideas about the past in humanitarian decision\-making processes. 

 The research has contributed a number of important insights for the field: 

-  Revealing the heterogeneous origins of the humanitarian sector \[2\]; 

-  Questioning institutional narratives that present humanitarianism as timeless and apolitical \[1\]; 

-  Furthering understanding of the development of manifold professional practices within the humanitarian sector \(advocacy, fundraising, public relations, accountability\) \[5\]; 

-  Historicising reform agendas and processes within and around the humanitarian sector \[3, 6\]. 

 Taithe and Davey’s experience as applied researchers is captured in a series of working papers and joint publications with humanitarians \[4\], many of which have translated into academic work, designed to further knowledge exchange between different research users and producers \[6\]. The research is impact\-led from conception through to publication and beyond; it consistently engages with current practices and invites humanitarians to think historically within their practice *in situ*. For example, the *Disasters* special issue \[6\], edited by Davey with a contribution from Taithe, was the first time this profession\-facing journal had ever been devoted to historical questions in its 40\-year history. Interdisciplinary and fully peer\-reviewed, *Disasters* is the most important forum for critiques of humanitarian response in conflict and disaster settings; it reaches broadly to international non\-academic and humanitarian practitioner audiences.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Taithe and Davey’s research has had a multi\-level impact on analysis, decision\-making and training in the international aid sector. It has brought historical methods and analyses into the strategies and training of two of the four largest Nobel Prize\-holder global humanitarian organisations, Médecins Sans Frontières \(MSF\) and Save the Children \(SCF\). This impact\-led research has directly influenced the expansion and diversification of historical research capacity in the humanitarian sector, and, by extension, helped to improve the efficacy of relief work. Aid organisations typically have limited capacity for in\-house research and policy analysis, making the role of applied research centres and academic advisory positions crucial. The research of Taithe and Davey informed and contributed to some of the most important humanitarian policy think tanks  in the UK and Europe \(Centre de Réflexion sur l’Action et les Savoirs Humanitaires \(CRASH\) for MSF; Humanitarian Affairs Team for SCF\), while also advocating for historical perspectives in major global forums shaping aid agendas such as the steering committee of Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance \(ALNAP\); Fondation de la Croix Rouge; International Humanitarian Studies board; and the World Humanitarian Summit. 

##  Research agendas of organisations 

 Through the production and co\-production of research specifically for humanitarian practitioner readerships, this research has renewed INGOs’ and humanitarian think tanks’ internal research agendas. Through this work historical perspectives are now routinely included in debates and projects. Leading think tanks the Humanitarian Affairs Team \(SCF\) and CRASH \(MSF\) have initiated new historical projects of their own as a result \(several monographs advised by Taithe; edited volumes; occasional papers\). Historical considerations highlighted through the research have shaped the way that both individual NGOs and think tanks with a sector\-wide focus approached consultations for the United Nations World Humanitarian Summit, a series of international meetings culminating in a conference in Istanbul in 2016. For example, SCF’s Humanitarian Effectiveness project, launched at Istanbul, considers evolving understandings of efficiency and value in aid work and was framed in historical terms, citing multiple publications by Taithe and Davey, including \[3\] \[A\]. The study advocated for more regular use of historical methods to ensure *“a more rounded perspective on the environments in which humanitarians operate and the effects of humanitarian action within them”* \[A, p. 87\]. The Humanitarian Director at SCF UK thus states in relation to Taithe’s work: *“a key part of my role has been to foster far greater critical reflection within my organisation’s leadership space in order to look afresh at our own and the wider sector’s history… That simply would not have been possible without* \[Taithe’s\] *personal guidance and involvement”* \[B\]. 

 \[text removed for publication\] The research also extensively informed a flagship report by the ODI’s Humanitarian Policy Group. *Time to Let Go* \[D\] cited Davey’s research several times in its 80 pages, and included a section specifically focused on ‘learning from history’ \[D\]. The report draws on the research particularly to support the diagnosis of weaknesses in systemic reform as “ *less a failure to acknowledge and learn from past mistakes* \[…\] *and more a failure to use historical analysis to critically explore some of the foundational assumptions on which the system rests*” \[D, p. 12\]. The research has also changed the direction of MSF’s work on security, away from offering a public relations campaign and towards a research agenda devoted to the study of attacks on healthcare. Taithe’s plenary lectures on historical perspectives on attacks on healthcare debates at the Berlin Humanitarian Congress in 2014 made an intervention captured in an article co\-authored with MSF \[4\]. This shift of emphasis produced a book \[5\] on which the director of CRASH comments: *“*\[Taithe’s\] *chapter on the history of the notions of danger, risk, security and protection was of great added value to that project*” \[E\]. The shift towards more research to inform humanitarian practice secured a DFID/FCDO\-funded research project \(approximately GBP1,500,000 awarded to The University of Manchester; see section 3, grant \(iii\)\) involving MSF, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the World Health Organization and in collaboration with Chatham House, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University \(Taithe Co\-I\). It also influenced the strategy of sector\-wide influential think tank, CRASH, contributing to its publications, including an historical project for MSF on Hepatitis C in Cambodia \[1\] and the development of two major CRASH\-led historical accounts of humanitarian work. 

 The critical organisational and sector history is now accepted and used as part of current NGO policy\-making and decision\-making. When the Operations Department of MSF France commissioned a critical review of the operations carried out between 2015 and 2016 in Borno State, it included a “ *detailed historical account”.* The director of CRASH writes *: “working together has made us… more historically minded than previously. Studying the precedent of relief operations and organizations, critically looking at humanitarian buzzwords and at dominant discourses that are often marred in historical ignorance contributes to forging a culture in which myths play a lesser role”* \[E\]. They now value historical methods to produce better plans and policies. Practice\-based organisations such as MSF and SCF now commission research work which employs historical methods to inform programmes and reform decision\-making and policy framing, for instance ex\-MSF president Jean\-Hervé Bradol and Marc LePape’s historical account of humanitarian aid during the Rwandan Genocide. It has reshaped the writing of evaluation reports and policy papers \[A, D, F\], evidence of a durable shift which enables NGOs to comprehend their role over time and produce more nuanced policy\-making debates \[D, G\]. As the director of CRASH testifies: “ *For MSF, which dedicates important resources to the learning and development of its staff, there is no question that historical thinking contributes to having teams in charge of relief operations that are more astute.*” \[E\] 

  

##  Steering of norm\-setting organisations in the humanitarian world 

 Thanks to their historical research profile, both Davey and Taithe have contributed to important debates and policy groups for the entire humanitarian system, in this way informing the development of professional practice for the sector. Taithe, uniquely for a historian, has been invited to take high\-profile roles in the humanitarian sector: he has served on the Conseil Scientifique of CRASH since 2013; as a Trustee of UK\-Med since 2014; Trustee of the Mines Advisory Group since 2017; and was on the advisory board of the Humanitarian Policy Group\-ODI Global History Project between 2011 and 2014. In 2014, he was elected by the NGO member organisations to serve on the steering committee of ALNAP, the largest global learning network of NGOs, UN agencies, members of the Red Cross/Crescent Movement, donors, academics and consultants, and was elected in 2016 to the board of the International Humanitarian Studies Association as the first historian of this organisation’s governing body. After receiving the Fonds Croix\-Rouge Française’s Prix de Recherche in 2016, Davey served as the sole historian on the Conseil Scientifique of its successor foundation between 2018 and 2019. 

 These roles have ensured the far\-reaching influence of their research, including participation in the New York and Geneva United Nations humanitarian preparatory meetings and the final World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, which produced the ‘Agenda for Humanity’ – endorsed by most global humanitarian organisations and United Nations agencies \[G\]. Taithe was the only historian signatory of the commitments for academia formed as part of this Agenda, ensuring history features as part of the commitment to evidence\-based humanitarian action \[G\]. Extending collaborations with the United Nations system, in 2016 the Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute \(HCRI\) became a collaborating centre of the World Health Organization and in 2018 hosted the world meeting of collaborating centres working on emergency humanitarian responses. The WHO collaborating centre status was renewed in January 2020 under Taithe’s leadership, in recognition of the *“valuable contribution”* to research \[H\]. The collaborating centre was made its first partner on the ‘triple nexus’ – the relationship between humanitarian aid, development and peace. Only two other collaborating centres on this domain have been identified to date. 

##  Training and practice in the humanitarian sector 

 The embedding of historical thinking in the humanitarian sector led to the recognition of its importance in training programmes and events. The research \[1, 2\] has informed the development and delivery of such training, utilising the findings on epistemic communities and the politics of aid. It produced the historically\-grounded training of NGO personnel and underpinned the overall curriculum design for two classes of the Save the Children course *Critical reflection and humanitarian affairs* in 2018, and in 2019 for workshops to MSF staff on the uses of history in ongoing humanitarian work. These very well received workshops, entitled *Histoire synchrone*, built on \[1\]. MSF commissioned Taithe to create a history course unit for its new postgraduate programme, launched in 2019 by MSF, HCRI and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The course reached three cohorts of 60 students originating from the cadres of MSF, mostly national staff of MSF from every region in which the organisation operates from Afghanistan to Yemen. This demand echoed previous exchanges with MSF staff on the need to use historical methods to contextualise and improve understanding of humanitarian work. At the request of MSF, the history course has been *made compulsory* for all MSF staff undertaking their MSc since 2018 \(between 60 and 90 per year\). As the Director of Studies at Fondation MSF testifies: “ *Our senior staff…has realised the extent to which history carries lessons for their current practice...all of those I personally debriefed have expressed their enthusiasm in discovering the use of historical methods for their own work”* \[I\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Lesley Henderson’s sociological research on communicating plastic pollution addresses the problem of public understandings and behaviour change. It has influenced industry practice and informed policy development in relation to \(micro\)plastics communications. Her research has been used to prioritise the cultural context of plastics use, media framing of the problem and role of communications in behaviour change. This has influenced European regulation \(SAPEA\) and EU policy \(Circular Economy Action Plan\) and led to Ursula von der Leyen making plastic\-free oceans a ‘cross\-cutting priority’ for the European Commission in 2019. Dr Henderson’s work has also informed business and plastic industry approaches. \[REDACTED\]

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The impact stems from a body of research that Dr Henderson has developed over the past 20 years at Brunel University London in relation to health, science and political communications. At the core of her research is the relationship between communications and social change \(Ref. 1\-4; Grant 1\-5\). 

 **Between 2000 and 2001, Dr Henderson \(then, Lecturer\) examined media representations of human genetic research. She found that media values of drama and personalisation can undermine scientific accuracy, amplifying ‘breakthroughs’ and creating misconceptions amongst audiences about risk to human health.** Her work highlighted how 'science reporting' is firmly embedded within broader socio\-economic issues and how political and economic factors may drive a science story. This has provided crucial insights into the key relationships which influence media reporting of scientific research \(Grant 1\). 

 **During 2003, Dr Henderson explored reasons for low childhood immunisation amongst the Orthodox Jewish community in North East London. She identified the importance of ‘word of mouth’ networks and that media myths about the risk of vaccination may play a greater role than expected in marginalised communities \(Ref. 1\).** 

 Between 2006 and 2009, Dr Henderson \(then, Senior Lecturer\) led the audience reception strand of a project which explored the debates about the ‘state of youth’ in the UK and EU regarding public alienation from the political process. The research identified disaffection from formal politics as presented on mainstream media and a desire for more authentic depictions of young people. The findings showed how perceptions of ‘fakery’ can reduce levels of trust and engagement in expertise and recognised a desire for political messaging from more ‘trusted’ figures, such as comedians, who were seen as ‘neutral’ figures without an agenda \(Grant 2\). 

 Between 2016 and 2017, Dr Henderson led an interdisciplinary project mapping media stories and audience engagement with plastics pollution using news bulletins and the documentary film *A Plastic Ocean* \(Netflix, 2017\), endorsed by David Attenborough and Leonardo Di Caprio for promoting an anti single\-use plastic message. Dr Henderson found that emotive images of plastics were powerful and raised awareness, but low public scientific literacy meant people made little connection between their everyday actions and plastics in the ocean. She attributed this to media framing which links plastic pollution to wildlife entanglement and promotes myths about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Dr Henderson found strongly held societal perceptions regarding “good health” \(e.g. ‘plastic straws protect teeth’\) and assumptions about “good parenting” \(e.g. ‘plastic balloons are normal for birthday celebrations’\) which can undermine circular economy messages \(reuse, recycle, retain, refuse\) \(Grant 3; Ref. 4\). 

 In 2020, Dr Henderson went on Knowledge Transfer Leave to strengthen further the evidence base for the impact her research has had on plastic pollution. She engaged with industry \[REDACTED\] and policymakers \(European Commission, OSPAR, World Health Organisation\) to shape interventions for bridging the gap between education and human behaviour which resulted in more effective plastic waste management.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Henderson has made contributions to European policy options as a member of the SAPEA Working Group on microplastics. SAPEA \(Science Advice for Policy by European Academies\) is part of the European Commission’s Scientific Advice Mechanism that provides independent advice to the European Commission for planning and policy\-making. Because of her expertise in communications, risk and public behaviours, Dr Henderson was the only sociologist invited to be a member of the Working Group on microplastics, which included 26 colleagues \(comprising natural scientists; environmental psychologists; social scientists; policy makers\). Together, they produced a report \(Report 1\) which concludes that ‘evidence on microplastics does not yet point to widespread risk’ however warns that ‘the situation could change if pollution continues at the current rate.’ It was presented to the European Group of Chief Scientific Advisors \(GCSA\) in January 2019 who have fully accepted the recommendations from the report. 

 **I. <ins>Impact on the European Commission and Changes to the Risk Perception of Microplastics**</ins> 

 An independent expert report published by the European Commission in February 2020 refers to the outcome of the SAPEA Evidence Review Report and the activities of the European Commission’s Group of Chief Scientific Advisors both of which Henderson’s research influenced. The report corroborates that the data presented in the SAPEA report, “made recommendations on how the EU, together with other global policy actors, should respond to microplastic pollution based on state\-of\-the\-art scientific knowledge and insights” \(E1\). It confirms that the SAPEA report “has informed a number of debates both within the scientific community and among policy\-makers, including roundtable meetings of G7 Chief Scientific Advisors on Scientific Advice cooperation for microplastic pollution in Washington DC… and in Paris… and has strengthened international cooperation between Chief Scientific Advisors” \(E1\). 

 The Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation commended the report: “with the rise of microplastics pollution, we need to understand how microplastics interact with people and planet, so we can take action…The recommendations of the Advisors provide clarity on what we can and should do now, and what we need to know and how we can find it out in order to act later. The Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries was equally impressed: “the recommendations complement work already set in motion by the European Plastics Strategy. They will help us in our continued efforts to provide the highest standards of protection of public health and the environment, through sustainable management of plastics” \(E2\). 

 The European Commission report has also informed the ECHA proposal January 2019 to restrict intentionally added microplastics. Currently, “the releases of intentionally added microplastics in the EU/EEA are estimated to be around 42000 \[ *sic*\] tonnes a year. Additional releases from infill material used in artificial turf pitches could amount to 16,000 \[ *sic*\] tonnes per year. The proposed restriction would prevent more than 90% of these releases, or 500,000 \[ *sic*\] tonnes of microplastic releases over a 20\-year period” \(E3\). 

 The SAPEA report was also responsible for the point made by Ursula von der Leyen in her mission statement to the Commissioner\-designate for Environment and Oceans in September 2019. She ordered the Commissioner, “As part of \[the new Circular Economy Action Plan\], you will lead efforts towards plastic\-free oceans. I want you to address the issue of microplastics and ensure that the existing legislation on plastics is implemented” \(E4\). In the mission letter, von der Leyen labels this as part of the “cross\-cutting priorities” which will contribute to “conserving Europe’s natural environment” \(E4\). This statement demonstrates a shift in priorities at the top\-level of the EU, as a direct result of Henderson’s research contribution to the report. 

 The report has also reached international levels. It had a strong influence on the WHO report “ [Microplastics in drinking\-water](https://www.sapea.info/sapea-evidence-review-helps-shape-new-who-microplastics-report/)”; was cited in “The Ocean As a Solution to Climate Change”; discussed at the high level panel for a sustainable ocean economy \(involving presidents/prime ministers of Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal\), and was discussed by G7 science advisors at a meeting in Washington DC. The panel concluded, “The fact that we can also share findings from sociological research on the effects of ocean pollution on humans and society shows that interdisciplinary, joint efforts by the natural and social sciences to tackle these global problems are increasingly perceived and appreciated by politicians and donors alike” \(E5\). 

 \[REDACTED\] 

 The chair of the SAPEA Working Group acknowledged the importance of communication as emphasised by Dr Henderson, noting “a lack of evidence for risk doesn’t mean we should assume that there is no risk. As our social science colleagues have pointed out, it’s vital that we communicate clearly about uncertainties in the evidence, rather than just assuming that everything is fine just because we don’t know for sure” \(E8\).

 1. Summary of the impact 

 UEA research by Terry Haydn has contributed to a shift in public and policy discourse around pupil behaviour in English schools. Haydn’s research challenged DfE and Ofsted claims that behaviour was ‘satisfactory or better’ in over 99.7% of schools. His results influenced the recommendations of the Bennett Review on the impact of behaviour on pupils’ learning.  Teacher\-development tools incorporating the Haydn Scale are widely used resources for assessing and mitigating school behaviour challenges and have been used in training thousands of teachers in the UK and internationally. 
","
 2. Underpinning Research 

 **Identifying the extent of behaviour problems in schools** 

 The ability of pupils to learn in an environment free from disruption significantly improves their attainment and the morale of their teachers. In England, government publications had consistently claimed that poor behaviour was not a significant problem in schools \(Patten, 1994; the Steer Report, 2005/2009\). As recently as 2012, the Department for Education \(DfE\) and Ofsted claimed that behaviour was ‘satisfactory or better’ in over 99.7% of schools in England. UEA research by Terry Haydn was the first body of research to challenge this view. Through a survey of 250 trainee teachers and interviews with over 150 teachers in English schools, he demonstrated that pupil behaviour was, to some extent, a problem in most English schools \(R2, R6\). 

 **The Haydn Scale as response, and use in teacher development** 

 In 2002 Haydn introduced an instrument, now commonly referred to as *the **Haydn Scale** following media coverage**, to describe and assess classroom climate \(R5\). The scale, based on extensive classroom observation in English schools, describes classroom climate on a continuum of ten levels, from being ideally conducive to learning \(level 10\) to one in which the right of pupils to learn, and as a result their attainment, is severely inhibited by poor behaviour \(level 1\). Each level is defined by a descriptor, addressed in the second person to a teacher, with a short vignette of corresponding classroom dynamics designed to resonate with the experiences of teachers and school leaders. The descriptors capture the balance of emphasis on ‘control’ factors \(at lower levels\) versus ‘learning’ factors \(at higher levels\), and the implications of that level for pupil outcomes and the teacher’s enjoyment of their job. The scale was the first to bridge research and practice by providing an instrument enabling teachers and student teachers to consider reflectively the extent to which the teacher is in control of the classroom, and able to create and sustain a working atmosphere that optimises pupil learning \(R1\). 

 **Using the Haydn Scale to generate teacher testimonies about classroom climate** 

 Haydn’s more recent research \(R2, R3, R4\) used the Haydn Scale to elicit ‘teacher testimonies’, in which teachers report their experiences of addressing common problems relating to pupil behaviour. Haydn’s website presents coded teacher testimonies from 150 interviews with teachers \(R6\), and provides a resource enabling student\- and newly\-qualified teachers’ access to both the views of experienced teachers, and the strategies they use, to establish a working atmosphere in the classroom which is conducive to pupils’ learning. 

 **What the Haydn Scale and teacher testimonies tell us about behaviour in schools** 

 As well as radically changing perceptions of the extent to which behaviour is a problem in English schools, the research provides insights into the complex factors contributing to deficits in classroom climate and their influence on pupil attainment, teacher wellbeing, and morale. Teacher testimonies from the research give insights into ‘in\-school variation’ in classroom climate. By detailing the varying and subtle relationships between teaching skills, subject knowledge, learners and contexts, the testimonies illustrate why some teachers are able to secure higher levels on the Haydn scale than others, even when working with the same pupils. The testimonies also provide usable insights into teachers’ views on how teachers get better at managing pupil behaviour.

 4. Details of the impact: 

 **1. Influencing policymaking in the UK:** The landmark Bennett Review, published in 2017 \(S2\), was commissioned by the DfE to review the impact of standards of behaviour on pupils’ learning, and staff satisfaction in English schools. Bennett, Lead Advisor to the DfE on behaviour, invited Haydn to be an expert contributor to a series of DfE meetings. The Bennett Review cites 8 Haydn publications, including R1 and R2, and directly quotes 922 words of Haydn’s work \(R2\) to support Bennett’s proposals for improving school learning cultures by addressing behaviour. Bennett says: *‘To emphasise the case that there is a substantial opportunity to improve behaviour in schools, it is useful to quote extensively from Professor Terry Haydn* \(2014\) \(R2\) *below who made a careful exploration of both the appearance and the lived reality of classrooms in the UK’* \(S2\). 

 \[redacted text\] writes about the role Haydn’s research played in shaping the review: 

 *‘The report draws in particular on \[Haydn’s\] 2014 paper* \(R2\). *The research questioned the positive picture which had previously been painted of standards of behaviour in English schools and suggested that behaviour was a much more significant and widespread problem than was generally acknowledged at the time. The research contributed to the decision of the DfE to look into the issue of behaviour in schools... Since the publication of the reports, there is now a much more general acceptance of the importance of behaviour as an issue for schools to address, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to pupil wellbeing and attainment by deficits in classroom climate.’* \(S1\) 

 The Bennett Review has had far\-reaching consequences for policymaking on behaviour management in English schools. In 2014, Ofsted requested a copy of Haydn’s research \(S3\) and Haydn was subsequently invited to be part of the DfE commissioned review of behaviour in schools. Ofsted’s most recent policy document on behaviour, ‘HMCI commentary: Managing behaviour research’ \(2019\) cites the Bennett Review at length and marks a radical shift from their earlier \(2012\) statements on behaviour in schools. 

 **2. Developing teacher education to improve pupil behaviour: ** The Haydn scale is the most widely used instrument for understanding the issues of classroom climate and pupil behaviour in England \(S5\). Haydn’s research is adopted by many university\- and school\-based providers of initial teacher education. It has been presented to the 99 university members of the Universities’ Council for the Education of Teachers \(UCET\), its Executive Director stating *‘the research has been shared widely – and utilised – by HEI based educators since it was disseminated to them through UCET forums and the annual UCET teacher education conference. The 10\-point scale has had a positive impact on how classroom management is covered in ITE programmes and as a result, how it is dealt with in schools’* \(S5\). In October 2020, the National Association of School Based Teacher Trainers \(NASBTT\) selected Haydn’s research for inclusion in the online Routledge School Based Teacher Training Hub, commissioned ‘to provide trainee teachers and their mentors with focussed, accessible, evidence\-informed guidance that will help develop skills and confidence for successful classroom practice’. The online hub serves NASBTT’s 200 member providers and over 10,000 trainees. It is complemented by the book ‘Secondary Behaviour Management: The Essentials’ \(2019, edited by Oberholzer for Routledge\).  Both of these training resources present Haydn’s research, initially published in R1, to trainee teachers, mentors and teacher educators \(S8\). 

 Many thousands of student teachers have been inducted into the use of the scale in face\-to\-face invited lectures in ITE institutions since 2010 \(S5\), and the research instrument and teacher testimonies are used by many partnership schools when students go out on placement.  Feedback from institutions where Haydn’s lectures present the Haydn Scale shows a high proportion of attending trainee teachers find the research and supporting teacher testimonies to be useful. At the University of Oxford \(2016\), for example, of the 107 trainees making an evaluative comment on Haydn’s PGCE lecture and resources, over 94% considered them at least ‘valuable’, with 73% considering them ‘very valuable’ \(S6\). Trainee teachers at University College London \(2019\) stated the lecture and resources ‘ *really resonated with myself and everyone around me*’ and ‘ *put me at ease with the very tricky and daunting prospect of classroom management*’ \(S7\). The Haydn Scale improved trainees’ understanding of the complex judgements needed to establish good working atmosphere \(‘ *not just binary choices’*\), raised aspirations \(‘ *given me some goals I’d like to achieve*’\) and supported action for improving teaching \(‘ *something I will use when observing classrooms’*\) \(S7\). School mentors use the scale in observation/lesson evaluation practices, remarking on the impact of the Haydn Scale for overcoming ‘ *trainees’ anxieties about class management*’ through ‘ *discussion of the levels’* \(S7\). 

 Several Course Directors of leading Initial Teacher Education providers and behaviour experts attest to the usefulness and impact of the research \(S4, S5\), for example: 

 **UCL:  ‘...for more than a ten year period… he* \[Haydn\] *has reached 600\-700 student teachers each year, just as they begin teaching in schools across London and SE England. So, his research and findings have reached about 6,000 secondary teachers, and upwards of 300 schools....* \[The\] *research and the 10 point scale he used in the research has been very well received by the student teachers, in their evaluations and has had real impact in enhancing their classroom management, thereby improving teaching and the learning of young people, often in socially/economically disadvantaged circumstances. Terry’s research and dissemination has thus contributed to social justice for young people in London and beyond.’* \(S5\) 

 **Oxford:  ‘Terry Haydn has delivered an annual lecture on classroom management to our PGCE cohort \(n. 190 each year\) for the past 11 years. The lecture is based on the research outlined in Terry‘s book ‘Managing pupil behaviour: working to improve classroom climate’ and the 10 point scale on which the research was based. The lectures have been exceptionally well received by our student teachers and the evaluations of the sessions have been consistently positive. The 10 point scale instrument is therefore highly likely to have influenced the thinking and practice in classroom management of over 2000 student teachers from the University of Oxford. The vast majority of these student teachers now work in state education and many are in senior positions in schools.’* \(S5\) 

 Attesting to how the Haydn Scale and teacher testimonies evince recognition in those who teach in classrooms, \[redacted text\] \(Teachers’ TV, behaviour consultant and trainer\) commented on how they promote reflection, discussion and action relating to classroom climate: ‘ *I have used the scale and teacher comments arising out of the research in my own professional development work with teachers and student teachers. The scale unfailingly intrigues and interests those involved and is an excellent resource for exploring why some teachers become better than others at managing pupil behaviour. I have recently undertaken some work with STEM training and note that Professor Haydn’s work is used by them in their influential teacher training projects.’* \(S4\) 

 In April 2020, Haydn distilled and coded teacher testimony from his research in a way that clearly articulated the views of experienced teachers on the most common behaviour problems teachers encounter in classrooms. The teacher testimony resource accompanying the Haydn Scale gives teachers and student teachers better understanding of complex factors influencing pupil behaviour, the effect that classroom climate has on pupil learning, and insights into why pupils behave better for some teachers than others. This enhanced the accessibility of an important part of Haydn’s research, making the data, findings and tools easily available to initial teacher education students/tutors in higher education, and students/mentors in schools, to use in conjunction with the scale itself. This increase in the reach and impact of the research has been acknowledged by DfE’s Behaviour Advisor: 

 *‘The more recent accessibility of “themed” teacher testimony from the research, on the behaviour section of Professor Haydn’s website, has also, in my opinion, enabled student teachers and NQTs to benefit from the views of experienced teachers on how to address common problems related to pupil behaviour, such as how to get the class quiet, refusal, sending pupils out, moving pupils etc.’* \(S1\) 

 Many more teachers and student teachers have accessed the scale and teacher testimony on the scale via the Teachers’ TV lecture on the research. Several Teacher Education MOOCs/VLEs have featured the use of the scale, including UCL, University of Reading, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of Oxford, University of Sussex, University of Nottingham and University of York. 

 **3. Raising awareness and improving teaching and classroom management in schools:** 

 Haydn’s research has also contributed to changes in school management, school improvement and continuing professional development programmes associated with pupil behaviour. Behaviour consultant \[redacted text\] states *‘...Haydn’s research dispelled the rather cosy ideas about standards of behaviour in UK schools which prevailed a few years ago and has contributed to an acknowledgement that poor pupil behaviour is a major issue in the UK education system.’* \(S4\) 

 Setting issues of classroom climate in the context of school improvement, in 2016 Schools Minister Nick Gibb asked academy directors ‘ *What is behaviour like in your schools?*’, citing Haydn’s research and acknowledging Haydn’s findings about ‘the continued prevalence of disruption’ and their importance. Presenting Haydn’s findings relative to OFSTED’s ‘Under the Radar’ report and the Bennett Review, Gibb emphasised ‘ *understanding of the classroom culture in your schools*’ as a complement to school\-level data, and for ensuring ‘ *your academy trust allow*\[s\] *every pupil to go as far as their talents will take them.*’ \(S3\) 

 Bennett’s online Master’s level course on managing pupil behaviour makes extensive use of Haydn’s research. \[redacted text\] acknowledges that ‘... *Haydn’s research has had a significant influence in shifting perceptions of the issue of behaviour in English schools, and the scale and associated materials have had a positive influence on the quality of training available to teachers and student teachers in UK schools.’* \(S1\) 

 For school leaders and middle managers, the Haydn scale and materials have had an influence in terms of steering them towards making behaviour issues a higher priority, and in focusing on the problem of ‘in\-school variation’ in classroom climate.  At the level of individual trusts, Haydn’s research has contributed to academy improvement by providing tools to inform continuing professional development for existing teachers, for example by invitation from Sapientia Trust, whose Professional Development Lead invited Haydn’s training for *‘supporting and working alongside my teachers’* and requested *‘resources to use … across the wider Trust of four high schools and eleven primaries, and within the Teaching School.’* \(S7\) 

 **4. Influencing policy and practice and raising awareness internationally** 

 Since 2014, the Haydn Scale has been adopted in several other countries \(S9\) following translation of the scale and accompanying teacher testimonies into languages including Polish, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Japanese. The 2015 paper \(R3\) brought the scale to a wider international audience, and Haydn has subsequently been invited to talk about the research at a number of national and international conferences and seminars. The metrics for R3 in *Creative Education*, with large south east Asian readership, report 3,841 downloads and 4,927 views \(taken from scirp.org, as of December 2020\). The research is featured on teacher education MOOCs which include online interviews and simulations relating to the Haydn Scale and supporting teacher testimony resources, which have attracted subscriptions from over 140 countries \(S10\). Blog commentary from one of the FutureLearn MOOCs provides insights into why teachers find the Haydn Scale and accompanying materials useful. Participants praise the Haydn Scale’s ‘ *realistic approach*’ and linked ‘ *self\-review*’ resources for enabling teachers ‘ *to be honest*’ about classroom climate, helping them ‘ *address the factors that are influencing the learning environment*’. Teachers stated they ‘ *learnt a lot on behaviour management*’ thanks to the well explained articles \(S10\). 

 The translated Haydn Scale and materials have been accepted for publication on a major Polish education website \(S9\), and in February 2019, Haydn was invited to give a lecture and seminars on his research at the University of Tallinn, Estonia \(S9\). The Haydn Scale is widely used in schools and ITE in New Zealand; the Editor of *Principals’ Digest* described the scale as ‘one of the most widely requested and useful resources for school principals and lead teachers in New Zealand’ \(S9\). The research and supporting materials were presented and shared with 200 participants at the Innovation Teach National Conference on Behaviour in Chicago, 1st July 2014. Haydn was also invited to talk about the research at a national teacher conference in Slovenia \(S4\) and provided an online workbook on the working atmosphere of the classroom for its teacher delegates \(S9\). An adapted version of the scale for use with mathematics teachers has been used as part of the MathTASK teacher development programme in the UK and Greece \(S9\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by Prof. Bhattacharyya has firmly established solar\-powered mini/​micro\-grids in rural India as a basic electricity supply option. Consequently, 5,000 non\-electrified households gained electricity access, which has increased income generation, created new livelihood opportunities and reduced fossil fuel use and carbon emissions \(kerosene use reduced by 20% per year, saving 375t of CO<sub>2</sub> per year\). The work helped project delivery partners Mera Gao Power, Mlinda Foundation and Onergy Solar during their initial growth phase to realise their business targets. Prof. Bhattacharyya’s team’s advice underpinned the basis for the Department for International Development \(DFID\) India’s Decentralised Renewable Energy Access Markets \(DREAM\) project and the Government of India’s guidelines for solar power integration in rural distribution. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 
Globally, approximately 770,000,000 people still lacked electricity access in 2019 and most of them were concentrated in South Asia and sub\-Saharan Africa. The underpinning research was carried out through an EPSRC/​DFID funded project \(EP/G063826/1 and EP/G063826/2\) – OASYS South Asia between October 2009 and April 2015 and subsequent research work in 2016 for DFID India Through Practical Action \(ITC15055/1516/xx/EP/SDM\) and involved investigation of decentralised electricity solutions for rural areas without electricity. Led by Prof. Subhes Bhattacharyya of De Montfort University \(DMU\), the OASYS project was delivered by a consortium of five research institutes. In addition to DMU these were University of Manchester, Edinburgh Napier University, The Energy and Resources Institute \(TERI, India\) and TERI University \(India\). 

 Our research highlighted the role of local mini/micro\-grids for decentralised electrification of rural areas \[R1, R2\] and demonstrated alternative business models through action research. Solar PV\-based micro\-grid pilot projects were implemented for electrification of four locations in India between 2012 and 2015 \[R1, R2, R3\]. 

 \(1\) Community\-managed electrification of a cluster of five remote villages in Dhenkanal district of Odisha \(15kWp PV system for 140 households\); 

 \(2\) Shared solar AC pico\-grid in the Sundarbans, West Bengal delivered by Mlinda Foundation, serving 500 households and 200 shops; 

 \(3\) Private\-sector driven solar DC micro\-grids in Uttar Pradesh delivered in association with Mera Gao Power serving 2,200 households initially, with a promise to electrify another 1,200, reinvesting the profit; 

 \(4\) Community\-managed mini\-grid with the support of Kandhamal district administration, Odisha, serving 250 households and a school with 700 students \(18kWp AC mini\-grid\). 

 All these projects provided access to basic lighting and mobile\-phone charging facilities and supported electricity use for productive, educational and social purposes \(street lighting, community halls etc.\). The project team carried out the action research at sites 1 and 4 while the delivery partners, Mlinda Foundation and Mera Gao Power, chosen through competitive bidding, implemented the activities at two other sites. DMU, as the lead team, was responsible for the overall project delivery. 

 Our research confirmed the technical feasibility of electricity supply through mini/​micro\-grids \[R5\] but as one size does not fit all, appropriate solutions have to be found \[R1, R2, R4\]. Moreover, a utility\-like approach, offering a flexible, efficient and locally grounded service is required for  successful commercial delivery of small\-scale off\-grid projects and suitable enabling conditions are required in terms of tariff, joint liability sharing, and flexible payment options \[R2\]. The potential for integration of cleaner livelihood opportunities through decentralised electrification interventions was also demonstrated \[R3\]. 

 Subsequently, considering the thrust on grid extension in India, Bhattacharyya et al. \[R6\] have suggested the potential for embedding MW\-scale solar PV generators at the distribution grid level to create a cost effective, reliable, rural supply option.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research on mini\-grids at DMU has generated significant socio\-economic and environmental impacts at three levels \(local, national and international\) as highlighted below. 

 **\(1\)** **LOCAL LEVEL IMPACTS** 

 Action research undertaken through OASYS South Asia project has produced wide\-ranging impacts beyond academic knowledge creation. A brief summary of social, environmental and economic impacts follows. 

 <ins> **Social impact**</ins> 

 The project has impacted 5,000 rural households directly and reduced their dependence on kerosene. For example, in Dhenkanal site, kerosene consumption was reduced by half – from 7l per household per month to 3.50l \[C1\]. Similarly, pico\-grid users of Mlinda have reported a reduction of kerosene use from 3l to 1.50l per month, resulting in a saving of 75% in kerosene expenditure \[C2\]. Women are a direct beneficiary here – lights in the kitchen make cooking easier \[C2\]. 

 Access to light has improved the quality of life of the communities. In the Mlinda intervention area, electricity has reached schools and shops as well as households. Shops are using electricity for 3 to 6 hours per day, allowing for business after dark. Light in the evening has allowed pupils to read 2 to 3 hours at night \[C1, C2\] and helped womenfolk to continue with their handicraft work. Streetlights in the site have instilled a better sense of security in the villages. 

 Reduced kerosene use has mitigated health hazards and safety risks. Improved roads have made it easier to take patients to hospitals and the local community health staff have started to visit the villages at the Dhenkanal site \[C1\]. 

 Electrification of a school in the Dhenkanal site and another in the Kandhamal site has contributed to better education, and pupils in electrified villages are taking more interest in their studies. A teacher in Baguli village in Dhenkanal revealed that ‘Children come prepared to class now, they study at home under light.’ Earlier that wasn’t the case and they ‘used to never do their homework’ \[C1\]. 

 <ins> **Environmental impact**</ins> 

 Four demonstration projects have saved kerosene consumption between 90,000l and 150,000l per year. This resulted in a carbon saving between 225t and 375t of CO<sub>2</sub> per year \[C3\]. In addition, the availability of clean electricity has reduced local pollution in terms of smoke, fumes and particulate matter. 

 <ins> **Economic impacts**</ins> 

 The availability of electricity is supporting income generation prospects in the villages. Some 60% of the shops electrified through pico\-grids in the Mlinda intervention area reported an increase in income and 67% of those reporting an increase in profit attributed this to electricity access \[C2\]. The social enterprises Mlinda Foundation and Mera Gao Power received support from the project, which has allowed them to grow their business activities and reach their targets \[C4\]. Similarly, the complex project has given experience to the EPC \(Engineering, Procurement and Construction\) contractor, Onergy Solar, to become a mature player in the sector \[C5\], although the economic benefit is difficult to estimate in monetary terms. 

 **\(2\) MACRO\-LEVEL IMPACTS** 

 The research led to a follow\-up advisory project with DFID India led by Prof. Bhattacharyya, which resulted in the development of the DFID investment programme, DREAM \(2016–2020\) \[C6\]. In addition, the Government of India has prepared a Guideline for Development of Decentralised Solar Power Plants \[C7\] based on the project report and the subsequent publication by Bhattacharyya et al. \[R6\]. 

 **\(3\) INTERNATIONAL IMPACTS** 

 The research and debates on mini\-grids have been shaped and influenced by the work reported here. Chapters of two books from the OASYS South Asia project have been downloaded many times: 25,000 downloads for ‘Mini\-Grids for Rural Electrification of Developing Countries’ and 17,000 downloads for ‘Rural Electrification Through Decentralised Off\-grid Systems in Developing Countries’. The paper by Sen and Bhattacharyya \[R6\] has been cited more than 305 times according to the Scopus database. Professor Bhattacharyya has been appointed as the adviser for the Springer Sustainable Development Goals Series \(for subseries SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy\). 

 The OASYS South Asia project has also received two awards: the Green Gown Award 2015 for Community Innovation at the national level and at the international level. The judges highlight that: ‘This is an innovative project that aims to empower and improve the lives of off\-grid rural communities with real scope for expansion’ \[C8\]. The project was one of the three shortlisted projects for the Energy Institute Award for 2020 in the Energy Access category. 

 The work has featured in the media: *BBC Futures* has carried a story based on off\-grid systems where Bhattacharyya has been cited \[C9\] while the *New Scientist* has also carried a story and interview \[C10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Campbell’s Expressive Life Writing \(ELW\) methodology, a participatory and research\-based practice, provides an adaptable, humanities\-based resource for survivors of conflict in multiple contexts. Emerging from Campbell’s post\-conflict poetry and her applied research into creative writing as practice, the ELW methodology is now the basis for training programmes in Iraq, Lebanon and Northern Ireland. Campbell’s ELW practice \(1\) benefits survivors of conflict, improving their well\-being, coping abilities and decision\-making; \(2\) has been adopted by aid workers and rights activists working to mitigate gender\-based violence; and \(3\) has influenced the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) policy in Iraq. In summary, Campbell’s research has had a positive impact on post\-conflict societies, providing an effective and sustainable methodology for a wide range of beneficiaries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Campbell’s research into Creative Writing \(CW\) pedagogy develops new ways of using writing practice in post\-conflict reconstruction. In her poetry and in her publications on CW pedagogy, Campbell explores the socially transformative potential of writing praxis. Her research, based on her formative work in post\-conflict Northern Ireland, addresses how creative writing helps to support personal, community and organisational change. 

 Since joining The Open University \(OU\) in 2014, Campbell has continued to develop her research focused on the connections between creative writing and post\-combat recovery, in both clinical and non\-clinical environments, with both military veterans and civilian survivors of conflict. Campbell’s research reveals that creative writing practice with conflict survivors nurtures an ethics of recognition and stimulates social cohesion. Campbell’s development of a methodology for ‘interviewing\-in\-place’ and her espousal of expressive life writing as ‘research in practice’ has led directly to projects in Northern Ireland, Lebanon and Iraq. 

 Campbell’s collection **Heat Signature** \(2017\) **\[O1\]** collects her ‘Voices of War’ award\-winning work, as well as her poems showcased at the British Council ‘Peace and Beyond’ Conference \(2018\) marking 20 years since The Good Friday Agreement. Her co\-editorship of **Eavan Boland: Inside History** \(2017\) containing her essay ‘ **Eavan Boland and the development of a poetics**’ explores how a socially\-engaged poetic practice emerges after conflict and how creative writing practice generates literary activism **\[O2\]**. 

 Discovering how well the CW disciplinary tenets of ‘learning by doing’ and ‘iterative practice’ can work, Campbell widened the remit of her projects. Collaborating with Dr Meg Jensen \(researcher in trauma\-testimony\), Campbell developed responses to post\-conflict recovery and peace\-building, providing workshop exercises and self\-reflective frameworks while training fellows from Gulf Cooperation nations \(2016\). These frameworks were then further adapted during writing\-workshops with Iraqi activists \(2017\-18\) and Lebanese social workers/Syrian refugees \(2018\-19\). The co\-authored output, **The Expressive Life\-Writing Handbook** \(2017, 2018\), consolidates this research, setting out how it can be applied in post\-conflict zones **\[O3\]**. 

 At the same time, Campbell’s poetry addressed the challenges of post\-conflict art, not only in **Heat Signature** \(2017\) **\[O2\]**, but also in a number of poetry\-collaborations: with the Arts Council\-supported ‘What else’ post\-conflict poetry edition of the Poetry Jukebox \(2018\); with community\-arts projects via the Institute of Conflict Research \(Northern Ireland\) \(2018\-19\), and with the Peace IV/Reconciliation Fund\-supported stage shows of work reflecting on the Northern Ireland peace process and Belfast Agreement  \(London, Belfast, Armagh, Dublin, 2018\-19\). This post\-conflict work in poetic expression allowed Campbell to develop ways of dealing with difficult subject matter, practices that she then developed into workshop strategies for working with traumatised communities. 

 Noting that writing practice develops resilience in post\-conflict zones when local stakeholders are involved, Campbell set out her inclusive iterative practice in the chapter **‘Negotiated Truths and Iterative Practice: The Women in Conflict Expressive Life Writing Project’ \[O4\]**. Developing these ideas in her next output, ‘ **Writing\-based interventions: from Communities of Practice to Life Stories’**, Campbell drew upon Etienne Wenger’s insight that shared experiences of writing can create ‘communities of practice’ \(CoPs\) \(Wenger 1998: 73\) in order to outline her own distinctive practice in which participation in her ELW workshops generates forms of knowledge development that can be shared **\[O5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Campbell’s poetry has changed readers’ views on the impact of war, as well as on the capacity for healing, and her CW methodology as set out in her expressive life\-writing handbook has had a direct impact in three distinct areas: \(i\) on the health and well\-being of survivors of conflict zones/ contested environments; \(ii\) on the operation of aid agencies, charities and aid workers, and; \(iii\) on the policies adopted by large aid agencies. 

 **\(i\) Impact on the health and well\-being of survivors of conflict zones/ contested environments** 

 <ins> **A</ins><ins>k</ins><ins>kar</ins> <ins>Network for Development \(AND\)</ins><ins>, Lebanon**</ins> 

 In 2018\-19, Campbell and Jensen used their research **\[O3\]** as the basis for setting up the ELW Capability Transfer project in collaboration with AND \(a women’s charity in Lebanon which works with up to 15,000 women\). This led to an 11\-week capacity\-building program with 11 social workers, followed by a year\-long programme dedicated to training specialists in gender\-based violence and children’s support from AND, the International Rescue Committee and UNICEF. AND’s Project Director testified that the “ *impact of the exercises \[has\] been extremely visible on both social workers \[who are themselves survivors of conflict zones\] and participants’, with a significant “effect on capability and resilience*” **\[C1\]**. The Project Director expressed the potential longevity of the project with ELW being a “ *gateway to more than one adapted/ customised tool in this period of acute crisis in Lebanon*” **\[C1\]**. All the social workers working with adults \(in feedback questionnaires\) suggested ELW would change their practice **\[C1\]**. As a result of this enhanced training, 140 survivors \(mainly Syrian refugees\) now follow a “ *life plan*” written during ELW sessions, which has the “ *effect of making women attend \[sessions\] more regularly*” and has increased “ *resilience and capacity*” **\[C1\]**. 

 Furthermore, a peer\-formed group of Syrian refugees settled in the Akkar region \(Lebanon\) who came through the ELW programme made a movie ‘Our Life Stories as Refugees’ to help other refugees deal with gender\-based violence through reflective practice. One participant stated that “ *what inspires me and encourages me to write stories about my life is knowing that it will increase my awareness and help me to be confident in myself and able to face the difficulties I’ve encountered in my life*” **\[C2\]**. Another participant explained “ *I was encouraged to participate in the group, so I did, and I overcame the pain that was inside me and I was encouraged to do expressive writing. I expressed things that happened to me that I had not previously expressed. I thank all the staff for the project*” **\[C2\]**. 

 <ins> **Participation and Practice of Rights \(PPR\)</ins><ins>, Belfast**</ins> 

 In October\-November 2019, Campbell devised the ‘Re\-Writing Ourselves’ programme for campaign activists: a\) to draw on personal experience in writing for activism, and b\) to learn resilience\-building techniques through writing\-practice. PPR is a group that supports marginalised people in Belfast through a human rights\-based approach, with the aim to make social and economic change in their communities. PPR integrated Campbell’s writing\-practice into their support programme. During these workshops, the five activists were presented with the opportunity for personal development through ELW. The PPR report concluded participants could “ *recognise themselves and their stories in work by other writers*” resulting in “ *reduced isolation*” and increased confidence. Participants noted they could “ *articulate better*”, “ *felt okay when going public*”, and “ *felt how writing supports \[their\] overall well\-being*”. Participants also demonstrated enhanced activism \(I “ *will have notes in my journal to begin using my stories in telling how it is to powers that be*”\) evidenced by participant\-questionnaires and PPR’s Participant\-Observer testimonial **\[C3\]**. Furthermore, all participants felt “ *more confident*” and gained a sense of achievement, and all participants agreed with the statement that the “ *workshop had opened up new possibilities*” **\[C3\]**. 

 **\(ii\) Impact on the operations of aid agencies, charities and aid workers:** 

 <ins> **INMAA Organisation for Development, Iraq**</ins> 

 Campbell’s research shaped the publication ‘Expressive Writing in documenting sexual violence’ \(August 2015 \- May 2016\). Campbell trained twelve social workers/activists in ELW in Iraq, who have adopted the **ELW Handbook** in Arabic as their standard text. The twelve were managing “ *1000 on\-going cases*” of gender violence, with an additional “ *150 cases of sexual violence*” **\[C4\]**. The INMAA Director stated that “ *The training in the techniques of interviewing the victims, asking them to tell their stories and encouraging them to communicate \[…\] has also been important for both the lawyers and the social workers*” **\[C4\]**. Beyond Borders Director Mark Muller QC states: “ *The impact of this project on the working practices of the INMAA organisation are reflected in the change in their methods of interviewing survivors \[…\]. The team in Kirkuk are working when they can to input the backlog of cases going back several years*” **\[C4\]**. 

 The INMAA Project completion report produced by Muller stated that “ *the long\-term impact \[…\] has made clear the extent to which the integration of this approach \[…\] will alter the experience of subjects*” **\[C5\]**. He continued that “ *the EW project has gone well beyond expectations in the depth and comprehensive material they have produced. This in turn enabled the INMAA team to reflect on and improve their working practices especially with respect to the interface with victims/clients*” **\[C5\]**. The project dealt with 1,500 cases and 2,000 new referrals **\[C5\]**. As a result, the **Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s \(FCO\)** 2nd edition of the International Protocol \(2017\) now follows the approach advocated by the **ELW Report and Handbook**. In 2017, the study was conducted on survivors of violence in the Iraqi provinces: “ *The sample included 100 women survivors from the governorates of Nineveh, Anbar, Kirkuk, Diyala, Babil and Salahuddin*” **\[C6\]**. After Daesh was defeated, the survivors sought safe havens in the provinces of Baghdad, Karbala, Dohuk and Basra. These projects were run by ELW\-trainees, psychologist Dr. Nuha Al\-Darwish, and Human Rights and International Law / Women’s Law Expert, Major General Khaled, who tested the ELW materials with trained psychotherapists and survivors of gender\-based\-violence **\[C5\]**. 

 <ins> **‘Countering Violent Extremism and Combatting Gender\-Based Violence’ FCO project**</ins> 

 Campbell and Jensen trained 12 participants from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries \(GCC\) \(March 2016\-March 2017\) with **The Stabilisation and Recovery Network \(TSRN\)** for the UK government’s ‘Countering Violent Extremism Programme’. They included representatives from the Ministry of Interior, Justice and Information. Fellows were taught life\-story techniques, which consequently changed their interactions with survivors because of their training **\[C7\]**. One fellow noted, “ *It provides a way to explore one’s feelings about their experience with extremism, to discover root causes of extremism, and \[…\] work toward a better understanding*” **\[C7\]**. 

 Campbell and Jensen trained another 100 participants in Iraq \(October 2016\-January 2017\) under the FCO project. This in turn brought together diverse Iraqi stakeholders who created practice\-groups. The ELW practice was taken up by a peer\-led group of practitioners in Iraq, where “ *multi\-disciplinary workshops \[…\] transferred knowledge/ experience of new practices to challenge negative narratives and explore narrative routes*” **\[C8\]**.

 In 2017\-2018, Campbell and Jensen were lead consultants for the UNDP’s SIRI project in ELW. The project aims were: \(a\) capacity building for social workers in ELW techniques; and \(b\) documentation of individual experiences of reflective learning. Campbell and Jensen’s training comprised two five\-day courses for 70 social workers. 

 UNDP adopted ELW techniques for training their new community workers, and they in turn adopted the programmes for their home locales \(2018\). A Minister at the Dept of Social Affairs, Iraq, stated now “ *social workers play an active role in showcasing what is happening within society, especially civilians that have been subjected to violence \[…\] This kind of documentation is much needed*” **\[C9\]**. Testimony from UNDP’s Gender Specialist stated “ *this project will help women to deal with the past, document their stories \[…\] as well as ensure all stories of those who suffered \[and\] also community stories*” survive **\[C10\]**. Abbas concludes that “ *UNDP agreed to document all \[these\] stories*” which will “ *become a reference for the Iraqi government to strengthen its social protection policies*” **\[C10\]**. Furthermore, UNDP has “ *been able to apply ELW in light of an urgent need to respond to the potential increase in domestic violence \[in Iraq\] that we feared would be one result of the COVID\-19 lockdown*” with 75 social workers from NGOs across 15 governorates in Iraq, with 7,500 women reached in 10 days **\[C10\]**. She sums up: “ *In Iraq, the biggest obstacle facing reconciliation is dealing with the past in ways that make a fresh start possible. Expressive Writing in dealing with the past is a key methodology in achieving community reconciliation in Iraq’s post\-conflict environment which help increasing the well\-being of groups at risk*”. She added: “ *Women voices, roles and stories are often ignored; therefore, we came up with this initiative to reach out to a wider group of women and listen to their stories through our newly\-established partnership with the MOLSA team of female social workers*” **\[C10\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Sussex research on education and peacebuilding led UNICEF to incorporate Education Sector Focussed Conflict Analyses into its work to support peacebuilding in conflict\-affected contexts. It enabled UNICEF to successfully implement a USD150,000,000 Peacebuilding in Education and Advocacy Programme \(PBEA\), which delivered analysis – and achieved subsequent policy and capacity improvements – in 14 conflict\-affected contexts. Further Sussex research, funded by the PBEA programme, led to the development of the “4Rs framework” for analysing and reforming education systems in conflict\-affected contexts, which has been widely used by UNICEF teams and their partners. UNICEF’s role as a global actor and thought leader, and its influence on state and non\-state actors operating in this field, then ensured that this shift in approach had important effects on ‘good practice’ in conflict\-affected contexts amongst multiple actors, including the World Bank, UNESCO\-IIEP, and several national governments. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Whilst education’s relationship to economic growth and societal development is well\-known, education systems’ links to war and peace are much less so. Sussex researchers have played a leading role in pioneering systematic research on the relationships between education, conflict and peacebuilding. This research began in 2010, with the Dutch\-funded UNICEF ‘ *Education and Peacebuilding in Conflict Affected Contexts’* project led by Professor Mario Novelli \(Sussex\) in collaboration with Professor Alan Smith \(University of Ulster\). This research explored the relationship between education, conflict and peacebuilding in Nepal, Lebanon and Sierra Leone \[R1\], and found that: 

1.  Education sectors were marginalised in UN peacebuilding agendas and funding, while peacebuilding measures were rarely integrated into education plans 

1.  Education could help to ameliorate political, economic, and sociocultural inequalities that underpinned conflict 

1.  Conflict\-sensitive research and analysis of education systems and policy can be supportive of, and conducive to, peacebuilding. 

 These findings underpinned the creation of a USD150,000,000 UNICEF\-led ‘Peacebuilding, Education and Advocacy’ \(PBEA\) programme \(2012\-2016\), implemented in 14 countries, which included a significant research component that was co\-led by Professor Novelli, in conjunction with partners from the University of Amsterdam and the University of Ulster. This included Sussex\-led case study research in Pakistan, South Africa, South Sudan and Kenya. The Sussex team were directly involved in programme implementation, commissioned to develop the methodology and lead the pilot ‘Education Sector Focussed Conflict Analyses’ in Sierra Leone. The approach was designed to reduce conflict drivers within education systems and maximise the education systems’ potential contribution to peacebuilding. 

 The earlier research \[R1\] underpinned the development of an innovative **‘**4Rs framework’ for understanding the role of education in peacebuilding \[R2\], developed by Novelli in collaboration with Cardozo \(Amsterdam\), and Smith \(Ulster\). The framework guides systematic context/conflict sensitive analysis of education structures, processes and content, and informs approaches for sustainable peace involving transformations of political, economic, and cultural inequalities in and through education, while ensuring that reconciliation between communities through education is also supported. This requires attention to the ‘4Rs’, addressing both underlying causes and the legacies of conflict: **redistribution** of resources and access across social groups, **recognition** of identities and diversity, **representation** in decision\-making at all levels, and **reconciliation* – dealing with the legacies of conflict through education. These represent entry points for integrating peacebuilding into education plans, policies, and programmes and education into peacebuilding strategies, thus ensuring the framework is potentially adaptable for use by a range of users, at different levels, in different geographical or stakeholder domains, from research to policy and practice. 

 The ‘4R’s framework’ underpinned a 2014\-2017 collaborative programme of research in eight countries involving researchers from the Universities of Sussex, Ulster, and Amsterdam, Cape Town University of Technology \(CPUT\) and the University of Rwanda \[R2\-R6\]. The research involved: a UNICEF\-commissioned Research Consortium on Education and Peacebuilding studying education policy, teachers, and youth and peacebuilding in Pakistan, Myanmar, Uganda, and South Africa; an ESRC\-funded comparative study of the Role of Teachers in Peacebuilding in South Africa and Rwanda; and two studies of education governance and peacebuilding in South Sudan and Kenya, commissioned by UNICEF’s Eastern and Southern Regional Office. These studies engaged with two key problems: the reproduction of political, economic, and cultural inequalities in and through education, contributing to tensions and undermining peacebuilding and reconciliation; and the marginalisation of education in UN peacebuilding agendas and of peacebuilding objectives in national education planning. The key findings were: 

1.  Relationships between education and peacebuilding are shaped by specific historical and contemporary inequalities and conflict dynamics, political economic contexts, peacebuilding and reconciliation strategies, and government\-donor relations and priorities \[R1, R4\] 

1.  A lack of attention from international and government actors to dimensions of redistribution, representation, recognition, and reconciliation in education policy and practice contributes to the reproduction of inequalities and tensions associated with conflict \[R2, R3, R4, R5\] 

1.  Collective identities are linked to marginalisation in education, with particular communities \(e.g. refugees/Internally Displaced People/pastoralists\) experiencing challenges in education access, outcomes, relevance, representation, and tensions between ‘assimilation’ and recognition \[R4\] 

1.  Internationally\-driven policy agendas often neglect, and reinforce, ‘local’, context\-specific, historical inequalities \(e.g. racial, ethnic, gendered, geographic\), and contribute to education system fragmentation and donor\-government tensions \[R1, R4\] 

1.  Teachers play critically important peacebuilding roles as agents of social change, but face barriers in training, salaries, political influence, and social status. Youth also play important peacebuilding roles but face challenges in accessing relevant education, recognition, and representation in decision\-making \[R3, R5, R6\] 

1.  Peacebuilding efforts should be integrated in education development programming, not just in ‘emergency’ contexts \(commonly reflected in donor approaches\), but also before conflict breaks out and during transitional periods after conflict has ended \[R1, R2, R5\] 

1.  The promotion of sustainable peacebuilding and cohesion through education should involve redistribution, representation, recognition, and reconciliation from policy to classroom levels \[R2\-R6\].

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 UNICEF policy and practice on education in conflict\-affected contexts have been informed by the Sussex research, and UNICEF\-supported dissemination/advocacy of the research findings and policy implications has now influenced other UN actors, NGOS and national governments in conflict\-affected contexts. 

 **Impact on UNICEF policy and practice in conflict\-affected contexts** 

 The USD150,000,000 Dutch\-funded UNICEF\-led *‘Peacebuilding in Education and Advocacy Programme’* \(PBEA\) – also known as *‘Learning For Peace’* – operated in 14 conflict\-affected contexts between 2012\-2016. According to Corien Sips, of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the findings of initial research \[R1\], were “used as a building block for the new programme *”* \[S1\]. The PBEA programme has subsequently changed UNICEF education practice in conflict\-affected states and, while the PBEA programme was launched before the start of the assessment period in August 2013, most – if not all – of its impact can be seen from August 2013 onwards. According to \[text removed for publication\]: 

 “PBEA was the reason that UNICEF opted to design education programs in some fragile and post\-conflict countries with the goal to mitigate drivers of conflict… These were experiments at the policy level how peacebuilding can be included in education sector plans, institutional capacity development…and PBEA was rolled out in 14 countries.” \[S2\] 

 Professor Novelli developed the methodology for – and led – the first PBEA Education Sector Focussed Conflict Analysis report in Sierra Leone. This approach was then deployed in the other 14 countries where the PBEA programme operated from 2013\-2016. In UNICEF’s 2015 Evaluation Report of the PBEA programme, it was noted that: 

 “Meaningful results were achieved in integrating conflict sensitivity and peacebuilding into education sector reform and other policies; building institutional capacities of UNICEF, governments and implementing partners for conflict sensitive programming and peacebuilding; building individual and community capacities to mitigate causes of conflict; and increasing access to conflict sensitive education.” \[S3\] 

 The final PBEA Programme Report notes that impacts were widespread and that by the end of the programme on 30 June 2016: 

 “351 national and sub\-national policies have been influenced in this process and 176,498 institutions \(government agencies, schools, partner organizations, community associations and UNICEF country offices\) were reached through training, technical assistance and outreach initiatives.” \[S4\] 

 In specific contexts, UNICEF has also employed Sussex\-led research findings to inform assessment of the experiences and peacebuilding contributions of ‘marginalised’ populations. A 2015 UNICEF South Sudan situation assessment report, intended to inform marginalised populations’ participation in peacebuilding, cites \[R4\] 27 times \[S8\]. The assessment drew on findings concerning the significance of historical and contemporary conflict dynamics, educational inequalities facing specific communities \(e.g. pastoralist\), and the need to consider multidimensional inequalities and peacebuilding contributions in education planning \[S8, pp.23\-122\]. 

 Conceptually, the 4Rs framework has influenced UNICEF thinking in conflict\-affected states in a range of ways. In August 2018, UNICEF contacted Novelli, to inform him that they were adopting the 4Rs framework for the development of their *Background Paper: Contributions of Early Childhood Development Programming to Sustainable Peace and Development*, published in November 2018 \[S5\]. In a later interview \[text removed for publication\] noted that: 

 “The 4Rs actually suggested how governments should structure education policy to have at the macro level elements in place which decrease the risk of violent conflict. This is all very helpful and is very new thinking.” \[S2\] 

 **Impact beyond UNICEF** 

 UNICEF has also successfully advocated for the inclusion of the ‘4Rs framework’ in the ‘Education Sector Analysis Guidelines: Volume 3’, Chapter 10 on ‘ *Risk and Conflict Analysis of the Education Sector*’ **.** This text is produced by the Global Partnership for Education \(GPE\), UNICEF, UNESCO and the World Bank – four of the most influential global institutions for education policy and support – and translated into 5 major languages. These ‘guideline’ open source texts are the key resource used by National Ministries of Education in developing countries around the world to guide education sector analysis and planning \[S6\]. 

 In a similar vein, UNICEF co\-convened the ‘2016 Pan\-African Symposium on Education, Resilience and Social Cohesion’ **,** bringing together 14 African countries who adopted a communiqué \[S7\] signed by education ministries which committed them to incorporating conflict sensitive analysis in education policy and programming in their countries and building a culture of peace in and through schooling. The event was held at the Headquarters of the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, organised by UNICEF and the Association for the Development of Education in Africa \(ADEA\) with Sussex academics leading multiple sessions \[S7\]. 

 The research findings have also informed UNESCO’s conflict\-sensitive education\-sector analysis and planning. In a report on crisis\-sensitive education sector planning in South Sudan, UNESCO \[S9, p.7\] refers to Sussex research findings from South Sudan concerning fragmented and donor\-driven support to education and the implications for ministry planning and management. This report explores UNESCO’s role in developing South Sudan’s Education Sector Analysis and Plan for 2017\-2021, illustrating the mobilisation of research findings promoting conflict sensitive policies and educational reform. 

 PBEA lessons have also been taken up as part of the UN’s new peacebuilding directions, and testimony from the Peacebuilding Support Office \(PBSO\) \[S10a, 2.36\-3.58 mins\] illustrates impacts in terms of responding to population needs, addressing root causes of conflict, the role of youth in peacebuilding, and cooperation/coordination with education agencies. There is evidence that education, alongside other social sectors, is being taken increasingly seriously in UN Peacebuilding Operations. PBSO, in 2018, was supporting far more education related programmes than in 2010 \(increase from 2% to 8%\), which appears linked to UNICEF PBEA advocacy and lobbying. PBSO have also prioritised youth, and drawn heavily on Sussex research in Myanmar, Pakistan, Uganda and South Africa to inform their new youth strategy \[S10a, 2.36\-3.58 mins\]. Cecile Mazzacurati, PBSO, and head of the Secretariat on Youth, Peace & Security at the United Nations Population Fund noted, in October 2020, the importance of the 4Rs approach: 

 “The 4Rs framework has really been an important contribution to the peacebuilding field... We are also using it for a programming handbook on youth, peace and security – we used the 4Rs for the chapter on theories of change, after realizing that these actually work perfectly well for basically all peacebuilding ToRs \(not just education\-related\).” \[S10b\] 

 Finally, in 2020, the Sussex research team, in collaboration with the University of Ulster, Cape Town, South Africa, and Nazarbayev University, Kazakhstan \(UK GBP2,000,000 Global Challenge Research Fund Network Plus Grant 2020\-2023, AH/T00553X/1\) have begun building the in\-country human resource capacities for governments and agencies to continue this important and ongoing work by working with more than 40 young researchers and practitioners from Central Asia and Sub\-Saharan Africa in building capacity for conflict sensitive analysis of education systems.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The International Accounting Standards Board \(IASB\) *Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting* \(henceforth the *Conceptual Framework*\) provides the foundation for International Financial Reporting Standards \(IFRS\). IFRS enhance global corporate transparency, strengthen accountability, and improve capital allocation. Over 50,000 companies listed in 166 countries are required or permitted to use IFRS to prepare their financial statements. Research carried out jointly at the London School of Economics \(LSE\) and University of Bristol was used by leading professional bodies in the UK and other European countries to successfully lobby for important changes to the objectives of financial reporting in the *Conceptual Framework*. In line with the research recommendations, a revised 2018 version of the *Conceptual Framework* emphasises the importance of financial reporting information in assessing “stewardship” \- managers’ responsibility to protect shareholders’ interests. By *directly* specifying why companies prepare and disclose financial reporting information, the objectives *indirectly* affect the decisions of tens of thousands of investors, lenders, and other users globally. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Stefano Cascino \(LSE\), Mark Clatworthy \(University of Bristol\), and four other researchers from across the EU, investigated whether the stewardship objective of financial reporting can be subsumed under a single overall “decision usefulness” objective encompassing *both* a valuation objective *and* a stewardship objective. The initial research involved a systematic review and analysis of the extensive academic literature on the use of information by capital providers **\[1\] \[2\]**. 

 The primary research involved a large\-scale interview survey of experienced investment professionals from 16 countries around the world **\[3\] \[4\]**. All researchers made an equal contribution to the project. 

 **Understanding the role of stewardship in accounting** 

 The first output underpinning impact described here is a literature review **\[1\]**, which evaluated the dual function of financial reporting: 

1.  to provide information for estimating future cash flows associated with debt and equity capital to inform investors’ capital allocation decisions \(the “valuation role”\); and 

1.  to provide information used to preserve investors’ capital and control and incentivise managers \(the “stewardship role”\). 

 The focus in **\[1\]** on the critical role of stewardship in accounting challenged an existing focus among standard\-setters on the valuation role alone. The review further showed that capital providers use accounting information for different purposes, raising questions about the feasibility of a truly “general\-purpose” financial accounting regime prepared under one single “decision usefulness” objective. 

 One of the principal conclusions of the academic literature review published in **\[2\]** is that financial accounting information is typically used in conjunction with other sources. This indicates that the design of a financial reporting system should seek to maximise the competitive advantages of financial accounting, namely: verifiability, objectivity, regularity, and standardisation. These characteristics make accounting information especially \(and, arguably, uniquely\) useful for stewardship and contracting purposes. 

 The research published in **\[1\]** and **\[2\]** concluded that there is significant variation in capital providers’ use of information, and that they sometimes have competing objectives when using different sources of information. However, direct evidence on this issue is limited. To address this, original empirical evidence was generated through 81 face\-to\-face interviews with investment professionals in 16 countries. An innovative survey, which embedded an experimental design, examined investment professionals’ assessments of the usefulness of the *same* financial reporting information for *different* purposes. The results \(published in **\[3\]** and **\[4\]**\) indicate that objectives make an important difference to the type of information investors gather and how they use and value that information. In particular, the research showed that the relevance of financial reporting information is contingent upon whether it is being used for stewardship or valuation purposes. When assigned a stewardship objective, investors prefer information that excludes factors beyond managers’ control; for valuation, they prefer information that helps them in forecasting future cash flows and understanding the business. 

 **Challenging the absence of stewardship in the 2010 **Conceptual Framework** 

 The IASB develops IFRS for public and private sector entities around the world. These standards are underpinned by the *Conceptual Framework*, which provides the foundation for global principles\-based accounting standards. The *Conceptual* *Framework* establishes a comprehensive set of concepts to: 

1.  Assist the IASB in producing and revising accounting standards; 

1.  Help preparers develop consistent accounting policies in areas not directly covered by specific standards; and 

1.  Assist preparers, auditors, and users \(equity investors, creditors, lenders, etc.\) in preparing, understanding, and interpreting financial statements. 

 Previous revisions by the IASB of their 2010 *Conceptual* *Framework* included the removal of stewardship as a separate objective of financial reporting. Some national standard\-setters and accounting regulators expressed concern that this would impair the usefulness of financial reporting information for holding the managers of public companies to account. Its removal particularly prompted concerns that financial reporting was moving away from its historical roots as a primary means of mitigating conflicts of interest between managers and outside stakeholders. The focus in **\[1\]** and **\[2\]** on the critical role of stewardship in accounting strongly challenged the focus in the 2010 *Conceptual Framework* on the valuation role alone. The comprehensive analysis of the available academic literature showed that different objectives sometimes imply different informational properties for accounting. 

 Taken together, the findings of the research published in **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** strongly indicate that accounting information cannot always simultaneously satisfy the valuation and stewardship objectives of financial reporting.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 High\-profile corporate failures underscore the importance of managerial accountability and effective stewardship as fundamental concerns for investors, accountants, and regulatory and standard\-setting bodies. The research described here has helped restore standard\-setters’ focus on these important aspects of financial reporting. The principal mechanism for this is the influence of the work on a revised version of the *Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting*, published by the IASB in 2018. This replaced the 2010 version, which had reduced emphasis on the stewardship objective. The 2018 version clarifies and re\-emphasises the role of stewardship as part of the decision usefulness objective. Its increased emphasis on the stewardship objective has implications for the more than 50,000 companies in 166 countries around the world, which use the IFRS based on the *Conceptual Framework* to prepare their financial statements. 

 **Informing industry discussion and debate about the revision of the** **Conceptual Framework** 

 The research published in **\[1\]**\- **\[4\]** catalysed and informed international financial sector discussion and debate in the run\-up to the IASB’s publication of the revised *Conceptual Framework*. It was widely cited and discussed in international financial sector coverage and analysis of processes relating to the IASB’s development of the revised *Conceptual Framework*, as seen in **\[A\]**. Global auditing network PricewaterhouseCoopers \(PwC\), for example, which employs more than 250,000 people worldwide, commented in its February 2014 IFRS news bulletin: “ *The IASB will probably feed the discussion \[produced by the research\] into its Conceptual Framework project*”. News bulletins from multinational auditing firms Deloitte and Grant Thornton also discussed the research and its implications for the *Conceptual Framework*. International preparers of financial reports engaging with the research included the Group of 100 \(G100\), an Australian organisation of Chief Financial Officers. The G100 summarised and discussed the implications of key findings of **\[3\]** in its April 2016 members’ update. The professional investment community also engaged with the research, including via its discussion in an op\-ed in the *International Accounting Bulletin*, written by the \(then\) Director of Financial Reporting Policy at the CFA Institute. This noted that the research should “ *enrich the ongoing accounting standard\-setting considerations and debates within the conceptual framework around the objectives of financial statements*”. Practitioner engagement with the research was further promoted by its discussion on Twitter by IASB Board Member Ann Tarca, who commented on 13 December 2018: “ *Helpful research cited in Primary Financial Statements paper 21B \- Li 2016 JAR 54:4 and Cascino et al 2016 ICAS EFRAG report*”. 

 **Providing evidence for international accounting professional bodies to lobby for change** 

 As well as informing practitioner discussion about the revision of the *Conceptual Framework*, the underpinning research was instrumental in providing independent evidence available to and presented by professional bodies \- and subsequently reviewed by the IASB \- as part of the revision process. The evidence it provided was widely used by such bodies to advocate for the revisions ultimately reflected in the 2018 version. This influence resulted primarily from the use of the research \(particularly **\[1\]** and **\[3\]**\) by ICAS and EFRAG to lobby for the reintroduction of the stewardship objective as a central tenet of the *Conceptual Framework*. At a series of events run by EFRAG in 2015 in Amsterdam, Paris, and Helsinki, practitioners and users of financial information emphasised the critical importance of stewardship. Findings from the literature review **\[1\]** and empirical research **\[3\] \[4\]** were presented at five events with EFRAG \(held between December 2012 and July 2015\) and three with ICAS \(between September 2014 and September 2015\), as well as with the International Forum of Accounting Standards Setters \(IFASS\) \(see, for example, discussion of the research by IFFAS in Toronto in 2016 **\[B\]**\). 

 On publication of **\[3\]**, the \(then\) EFRAG Chairman Françoise Flores commented: 

 “*The findings of the study helped EFRAG reaffirming that the income statement has a major role to play and that stewardship should be acknowledged as a distinct objective of financial reporting in its comment letter in response to the IASB’s Exposure Draft Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. EFRAG thanks the academic team for their thorough work and ICAS for the fruitful cooperation*.” **\[C\]** 

 EFRAG subsequently encouraged the IASB to place more emphasis on stewardship. In so doing, they used evidence published in **\[3\]** showing that financial statements are relatively more important for assessing management’s stewardship than for buying, holding, and selling decisions. This was cited in their feedback on the IASB’s 2015 Exposure Draft on the *Conceptual Framework*, where they disputed comments that the assessment of stewardship should be considered secondary to buying, holding, and selling decisions **\[C\]**. ICAS’ response to the IASB Exposure Draft also refers to evidence published in **\[3\]** suggesting that fewer alternative sources of information are available to users when assessing stewardship. It uses this to propose that, in this context, “ *the role of the financial statements is \[therefore\] arguably more important than in a decision\-usefulness objective*” **\[D\]**. The use of the research in responses submitted by other major professional bodies \- including, for example, the Financial Reporting Council **\[E\]** \- further increased its impacts on the IASB’s development of the revised *Conceptual Framework*. 

 The research also directly informed the IASB. Findings from **\[1\]** were presented at its board meeting in early 2014, and its Exposure Draft **\[F\]** subsequently suggested increased emphasis on the provision of information for assessing managerial performance. The stewardship objective received much more emphasis by the time the final revised draft appeared in 2018, influenced, in part, by the advocacy efforts of organisations such as EFRAG and ICAS which used the research to reinforce their case. 

 **Shaping global financial reporting guidance: reintroduction of the stewardship objective** 

 These lobbying efforts were ultimately successful: the 2018 *Conceptual Framework* recognises that the objective of financial statements is to provide information that is useful to investors and creditors in assessing and influencing managers’ performance and stewardship **\[G\]**. This reflects the research conclusion that stewardship cannot be subsumed within an overall objective of “decision usefulness” \(the production and use of financial information to inform investment decisions\) as the IASB had previously suggested. 

 The revised *Conceptual Framework* specifically clarifies why information used in assessing stewardship is required to achieve the overall objective of financial reporting. In particular, it states that users need information about the resources of an entity, not only to assess that entity’s prospects for future net cash inflows, but also to understand how effectively and efficiently management have discharged their responsibilities by deploying the entity’s existing resources. As the research showed, the properties of the information required for both types of decisions often differ significantly. In particular, designing a financial reporting regime around a pure valuation objective risks sacrificing the relevance of financial reports for evaluating managerial performance. The most significant outcome of the use of the research both by the IASB and by professional bodies lobbying for change has been its contribution to this increased emphasis on the stewardship principle as a cornerstone of financial reporting globally. Since the *Conceptual Framework* provides the fundamental principles guiding the IASB’s standard\-setting process, the impact of its revision extends to the individual financial reporting standards and their post\-implementation assessments. 

 **Informing financial reporting practices** 

 By helping to shape the foundation of financial reporting standards, the research had a direct impact on standard\-setters and professional accountancy bodies. This is evident, for example, in its use in discussion papers issued by the IASB since the 2018 revision **\[H\]**. The work has contributed to improvements in regulatory practice, including by improving regulators’ understanding of the ways in which capital providers use financial reporting information **\[I\]**. 

 It also has very wide\-reaching indirect implications for the financial reporting practices of companies, which number more than 50,000 listed companies and a greater number of private companies from 166 countries, as well as auditors, investors, lenders, and many other stakeholders.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Since the previous REF, the University of Bristol’s patented ‘Ice Pigging’ technology has grown into a global industry; in 2015, the second largest water company in the world, Suez, bought the universal patent and acquired two Ice Pigging spin\-outs. With an annual turnover of up to GBP6.5 million in this REF period, and directly employing around 100 people, the innovative pipe cleaning method is now used by water companies throughout the world, including the US, Australia, Chile, Spain, Japan, Singapore and Italy, achieving environmental benefits, time savings and increased profitability. The versatility and cross\-sectorial benefit that Ice Pigging offers has led to it also being adopted in the heating, food, cosmetic, chemical, and paints industries. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Cleaning and unblocking pipelines is a necessity within industry, with two methods being traditionally relied upon. The first involves propelling a solid piston\-like object, or ‘pig’, through pipes, which must be reasonably straight and of constant diameter. The pig can be damaging to pipe walls and requires purpose\-built launch and receive stations. The second method is liquid flushing, which uses huge volumes of water, and which, in large\-diameter pipes, can fail to achieve the required velocities for effective cleaning. Following the flushing, harsh chemicals such as caustic soda are used to dissolve any residue. In addition, there is the issue of process efficiency; for industrial applications, the pipework may need to be cleaned on a regular basis and in certain applications, such as in food factories, the lines may require cleaning on a daily basis. 

 The question was then, how to clean equipment with difficult topologies \(varying pipe diameters, bends, valves\) in a way that reduces water consumption and the need for harsh chemicals, and that requires less time. The method should also be Clean in Place \(CIP\); the equipment doesn’t have to be disassembled for cleaning. Professor Quarini conceived the ‘ice pig’ to address these issues. The technology was patented in 2001 **\[1\]**, and over the years 2001\-2013, his research group was awarded government grants **\[i\-iii\]** that enabled the ice pig to be developed, trialled, and adapted for cross\-sector use. 

###  The Ice Pig concept 

 Ice Pigging is a CIP method that uses a concentrated suspension of ice particles in a solution containing a freezing point depressant \(usually salt\), otherwise known as an ‘ice slurry’. The slurry is introduced to a pipeline and quickly forms a plug that can be pushed through the pipe\-work with a pressure differential. The slurry can form a plug whenever possible, while also flowing through restrictions and complex topologies when required. Whereas solid pigs become lodged, in the event of a blockage the ice pig simply melts away, thus avoiding costly excavation works. Further, unlike conventional pigs, the ice pig can be introduced into complex networks of pipes through existing valves, thus avoiding expensive enabling work. 

###  Development of the ice pig for industrial use 

 Over 2001\-2004, DEFRA funding **\[i\]** enabled Quarini’s research group to conduct preliminary trials of the ice pig’s efficiency at cleaning fouling materials relevant to a range of industries, including jam and fats, meat, toothpaste, and fine slit and sand \(Fig.1\). The trials indicated that the ice pig was highly adept at removing ‘soft' fouling; using a volume of ice typically less than one tenth of the volume of water required for flushing **\[2\]**. They also found that the ice pig held together, was self\-healing, and maintained its identity under most flow conditions **\[3\]**. The group then investigated the distance an ice pig could survive as a plug\-like entity before melting. Based on experiments and modelling of ice slurries flowing in un\-insulated steel pipes, they developed a numerical model to predict ice pig longevity. Dr Stan Shire \(Research Fellow 2003\-2008\) worked on generic aspects of ice slurry flows and developed correlations relating the complex coupling between pressure drop, flow rates and ice fraction, which were needed to establish the operational regime of the ice slurries which were the ‘ice pig’. The key conceptual breakthrough was better understanding the rheology so as to customise both the rheology of the ice pig itself as well as the equipment to store and pump the slurry **\[4\]**. 

 
 
 

 *Figure 1. A thick Ice Pig going through a meat\-processing pipe* 

 In 2006, the spin\-out PCIP was formed to disseminate, licence and commercialise the technology. The same year, the first trials were conducted on live water mains in the Bristol area. These trials showed that Ice Pigging: 

-  improved water quality; 

-  reduced water and disinfectant usage; 

-  reduced downtime during cleaning programmes; 

-  did not require excavation for access to mains, instead being injected and extracted through existing hydrants. 

 These promising results were published together with data enabling engineers to scale and size the ice pig for full\-scale trials **\[5\]**. By the end of the 2000’s, the technology was recognised as a significant innovation for the process sector, earning a number of prestigious awards: 

-  Engineer Award for Process and Production \(2009\) 

-  Water Industry Achievement Awards for Most Innovative Technology of the Year \(2009\) 

-  International Water Association Project Innovation Award \(2010\) 

 In 2010, three postdoctoral Ice Pigging researchers \(Ainslie, Deans and Herbert\) set up another spin\-out, ADHQ, to provide expert design, assembly and commissioning of Ice Pigging systems for companies wanting to deploy the technology. ADHQ partnered with a local small company, Barvick Engineering, to manufacture bespoke Ice Pigging equipment at scale \(see Section 4\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Ice Pigging has revolutionised the way that pipes are cleaned in the UK and worldwide. During this REF period, it has expanded into a lucrative global industry, creating new jobs and providing cost and time savings for businesses not only in the water industry, but also in heating, food, cosmetics, manufacturing, chemical and power generation. 

###  Expansion of global Ice Pigging industry 

 In 2015, the Ice Pigging industry was acquired by Suez \(formerly Aqualogy\), the second largest water company in the world, for GBP\[text removed for publication\]. The company purchased the complete \(universal\) patent for the technology, covering all geographical and sectorial areas. It also acquired both the PCIP and ADHQ spin\-outs founded by University of Bristol Ice Pigging researchers. PCIP had ongoing consultancy contracts and licences at the time, all of which were taken up by Suez. All existing ADHQ staff accepted well\-paid roles at Suez. 

 Suez’s Ice Pigging industry has reported an annual turnover of up to GBP6.5 million, combining turnover in the UK, the US, Australia, Chile, Spain and Italy. They currently employ up to 100 people in the Ice Pigging sector **\[A\]**. The Operations Director at Suez states that: *‘\[Ice Pigging\] has been a game\-changer for our business. The benefits of Ice Pigging have led us to develop the technology globally, secure business with key customers and obtain repeat contracts. We look forward to continuing to provide Ice Pigging technology for our customers going forward and are grateful for the research undertaken by the University of Bristol which led to the development of this technology.’* **\[A\]** 

 Aside from Suez and its customers, Ice Pigging has had significant economic impact for the regionally\-based manufacturer Barvick Engineering, which originally collaborated with Quarini to develop the Ice Pigging equipment. Barvick has continued to supply equipment for Suez, with Ice Pigging equipment sales accounting for around 20% of the company’s turnover over the past six years **\[B\]**. 

###  Improved business performance of the water and sewerage industry 

 Between 2014 and 2019, Suez cleaned 100\-200km of customer pipework per year in the UK, or approximately 900km of pipe in total over the period **\[A\]**. Customers include Welsh Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy, Northumbrian Water, Affinity Water, Anglian Water, United Utilities, Southern Water, South East Water, South West Water and Wessex Water **\[A\]**. Internationally, Suez has delivered Ice Pigging extensively in Europe, the US, Japan, Australia and Singapore, cleaning a total of 4,500km of pipes globally during the REF period **\[A, C\]**. 

 Over 2016\-2017, the largest water\-only supplier in the UK, Affinity Water, used Ice Pigging to conduct one of the largest mains\-cleaning exercises within the water industry in recent years. One of the project’s highest risk elements was cleaning the cast iron/coal tar lined mains without adversely affecting water quality. Most companies choose the “not able to clean” approach or choose to relay or reline the pipes, at significant cost. In this case, Ice Pigging enabled effective cleaning of the pipes without affecting water quality. Over 950km was cleaned overall, ‘ *this includes over 120km of trunk mains and, in particular, over 80km of cast iron / bitumen / coal tar lined mains cleaned without incident. The project has delivered significant cost savings as result of direct contracts with specialist contractors and the contract model will be adopted for similar works going forward.*’ **\[D\]** Aside from these benefits, zero customer complaints were received during the entirety of the works, environmental impact was reduced \(with no harsh or synthetic chemicals required\), and approximately 5,000 tonnes of excavated waste material was prevented from going to landfill **\[E\]**. Furthermore, excavations were limited, as existing hydrants and valves were used to insert and retrieve the ice pig. 

 Other Ice Pigging success stories across the industry include: 

-  Dee Valley Water saw a reduction in the number of discoloured water complaints, from 4.9 per 1,000 customers in 2013 down to 1.32 in 2015 **\[F\]**, following an extensive mains cleaning operation to rid pipes of residual manganese. 

-  Hafren Dyfrdwy \(which brought together Severn Trent and Dee Valley Water in 2018 and now serves almost 85,000 homes\) **\[F\]**, completed 14 overnight Ice Pigging cleaning runs in Wrexham in 2019, which removed over two tonnes of sediment from 17.3km of pipes. *‘We’re really happy to say we had zero customer complaints relating to the cleaning process or traffic management, and many customers weren’t aware that work was being done in the area. The cleaning programme will continue next year and will help to ensure the network is significantly cleaner, which means we can continue to provide customers with great quality water.*’ **\[G\]** 

-  Welsh Water undertook a programme of works that involved cleaning 385km of potable water mains \(2018\). Their Contract Manager states *: ‘A typical ice pigging run takes less than an hour to complete, meaning the impact on the key measure of ‘customer minutes lost’ is minimal. This, along with less holes being dug outside customers’ properties, has ensured the projects have been successfully delivered with reduced disruption.*’ **\[H\]** 

-  Starting in 2013, Yarra Valley Water \(Australia\) launched a full\-scale programme to Ice Pig approximately 400 km of water mains per year for five years. Following the programme, the company reported a significant reduction in water quality complaints, which in some cases were virtually eliminated **\[I\]**. 

###  Improved business performance of the heating industry 

 Ice Pigging has also been effective in the commissioning of district heating systems. This sector is rapidly growing in the UK and is seen as one of the key target areas for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in densely populated areas. Each new district heating system involves networks of flow and return pipework between the energy production plants and individual buildings/developments. The standard approach for commissioning these networks involves using a high velocity chemical flush through side stream filters, which can take up to two weeks and has relatively high\-power requirements. With Ice Pigging, Suez can clean the same networks to an equal or better standard in just a few hours, requiring no chemicals and very little energy. Customers include Eneteq, Vital Energi, ENGIE and Pinnacle Power, together with work on flagship projects including Wembley Park and Heathrow Airport **\[A\]**. 

 In 2018, ENGIE used Ice Pigging to undertake a pre\-commissioning clean to remove swarf and construction debris from 1,560m of 300mm diameter pipework. This was part of the Angel Lane District Stratford project to extend the existing heating and cooling pipework connection as part of the construction of a 33\-story tower block with 181 apartments. A total of 64kg of sediment was removed. Works took place without exceeding the normal operating pressure of the pipework or causing damage to the pipe walls. Existing fittings for all pipe connections were utilised, and therefore no enabling works were required for the operation. All pipes were cleaned within one day, whereas a conventional flush of the network would have taken approximately one week and required high flows and pumping costs. Additionally, 30\-50% less water was used than would have been required using typical flushing techniques **\[A\]**. 

 Since 2017, Eneteq Services Ltd have used Ice Pigging on many of their newly installed networks, and have found that the method generally allows for the full network to be cleaned in a single day, provides a zero risk of blockages caused by the process, and also accommodates to all diameters of pipes, bends, valves and any other fittings. Eneteq has since applied Ice Pigging on high profile developments at Wembley Stadium and Heathrow Airport and states: ‘ *We will be continuing the use of Ice Pigging technology in cleaning operations and have several already in the planning stages.*’ **\[J\]** 

###  Improved business performance \(time and cost savings\) in other industries 

 Ice Pigging has been trialed with great success in other sectors including food and beverage, chemical, cosmetic, manufacturing, power generation and defense. In 2016, Yeo Valley wanted to improve their flushing method for cleaning remaining product from production lines. An Ice Pigging trial resulted in reduced waste, water use and chemicals, as well as improved product recovery. Ice Pigging equipment was then supplied and installed at the site **\[A\]**. In the same year, \[text removed for publication\] conducted onsite trials of Ice Pigging, which demonstrated that a 20% time saving was possible, resulting in the potential to increase production output with no additional investment. As a result, bespoke Ice Pigging equipment was installed at the site in 2017 **\[A\]**. In 2018, Suez supplied Ice Pigging equipment to Johnson Matthey, a global leader in chemicals and materials. The method proved to be a “game changer” in recovering material from pipe systems. Most importantly, it was able to reduce the long flushing times of up to eight hours to a matter of minutes, resulting in improved production efficiency **\[A\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The economic and political divide between cities and towns has become a major focus of British policy makers since the EU referendum vote in 2016. Research by Professors Will Jennings and Gerry Stoker has made a highly influential contribution to the understanding of Britain’s political divides, shaping the national agenda on place and public policy. It has shaped political debate \(with substantial, direct influence on the Labour and Conservative parties\), underpinned the foundation of a new think tank, the Centre for Towns, which has been at the forefront of the emerging policy agenda on *towns*, and has directly informed the design and content of media coverage of British elections by Sky News. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Between them, Professors Jennings and Stoker have been undertaking research on British politics and public policy for many decades. Both have published widely on democratic politics in Britain, while Stoker in particular has been prolific in his research on urban politics and local and regional governance. Their joint work over the past five years has considered the role of place in politics and policy, and specifically the geographical polarisation of public opinion and voting behaviour. 

 Their thesis of bifurcated politics, or ‘Two Englands’, published in *The Political Quarterly* in 2016 \[ **3.1**\] ahead of the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU argued that social and economic change – characterised by uneven patterns of growth and development between places – was fundamentally reshaping politics in England and Wales \(with Scotland having undergone a distinct nationalism\-based realignment in the recent past\). The study identified the sharpening of difference in public attitudes and identities between areas of growth \(typically core cities and university towns\) and areas of relative decline \(in particular coastal and former industrial towns\). This widely\-cited research was important in anticipating the political divides that came into stark contrast after the 2016 referendum and which seemingly have hardened since. Knowledge exchange relating to this research agenda was supported through two ESRC Impact Acceleration Award grants \[ **G1**\], co\-producing a practitioner workshop and report \(‘Place\-based policymaking after Brexit’\) with the think tank New Local Government Network. 

 In subsequent analyses of constituency\-level patterns of voting in England at the 2017 general election \[ **3.2**\], they revealed a ‘tilting’ of the electoral axis, with Labour performing better in major cities and university towns, and the Conservatives making gains in smaller towns and rural areas. Through analysis of longer\-term trends in electoral support, they argued that the result was better understood as a symptom of a long\-term divide emerging between citizens residing in areas of relative growth or decline. These findings were backed up through a report authored by Jennings and a team from the think tank New Economics Foundation \[ **3.3**\], with demographic and economic trends underlying these growing divides further discussed in an essay in the journal *Renewal* \[ **3.4**\]. A further ESRC Impact Acceleration Award grant \[ **G2**\] supported a workshop that brought together international experts, from organisations such as the Brookings Institution and Joseph Rowntree Foundation. 

 Subsequent investigation of these trends of geographical polarisation \[ **3.5**\] has shown that demographic and economic change \(and decline\) is linked both to the relative electoral gains or losses made by Labour and the Conservatives in recent decades, and to the prevalence of more ‘open’ or ‘closed’ attitudes \(at constituency level\). These research findings have made important advances in revealing the changing political geography of Britain, its interrelationship with social and economic conditions, and the challenges raised for public policy and the strategies adopted by political parties \[ **3.6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The research by Jennings and Stoker has generated three lines of impact. It has: \(i\) informed and shaped the discussion of geographical divides in British politics and society by parliamentarians, political parties and think tanks; \(ii\) informed and supported the creation of a new think tank, the Centre for Towns, which has been highly influential in informing and advancing the emerging policy agenda on towns; and \(iii\) provided expertise, data and analysis that has directly informed Sky News’ coverage of British elections. 

 i. <ins>Informing and shaping understanding of geographical divides</ins> <ins>in British politics</ins> 

 This research has made an important contribution to understanding of political change in Britain, and the significance of geography, among parliamentarians – especially among Labour MPs who represent former industrial towns. Their original study \[ **3.1**\] on the polarisation of British politics was highlighted in an essay in *The New Statesman* in November 2016 by Bridget Phillipson \(MP for Houghton and Sunderland South\), who wrote *“One of the best assessments I have read recently on what is happening to our politics is an article on the bifurcation of our politics that Will Jennings and Gerry Stoker published in the Political Quarterly in March this year…”* \[ **5.1**\], and by Rachel Reeves \(MP for Leeds West\) in October 2018 in an article for *Labour List* \[ **5.1**\]. Jennings gave oral evidence to the BEIS Select Committee chaired by Reeves in September 2018 about the significance of these trends for public policy. 

 Most notably, the research has strongly influenced the speeches and writing of Lisa Nandy \(MP for Wigan, candidate for the Labour Party leadership in 2020, and Shadow Foreign Secretary\). Nandy first addressed the significance of ‘Two Englands’ in an article for The Huffington Post in February 2017 \[ **5.1**\] and was expanded upon in a speech to the *Institute for Public Policy Research* in March 2017 \[ **5.1**\]. Nandy has since drawn upon the theme in commentaries for *The Times*, *The New York Review of Books*, and a much\-reported speech on power and political change also published as a commentary in *The Huffington Post* in September 2018 \[ **5.1**\], as well as in an essay for *Political Quarterly* in 2019. Nandy says “ *I came across it while I was working on a speech about the neglect of towns in the political debate. The clarity with which it set out the trends of the last forty years was the basis of the speech. It made a real splash among MPs from all political parties who found a way to interpret the trends … that they had been trying to understand for some time. For the media and parts of Westminster it also provided an entirely new perspective on the outcome of the EU referendum.*” “ *The importance of the Two Englands study is not that these trends are new, but that they have been happening for well over a decade and not been at all understood in public debate. That has now fundamentally changed*” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The research has also significantly influenced policy debates within leading think tanks and the major parties. The *Policy Network* report ‘Labour in English Towns’ \[ **5.1**\] published in May 2018 drew heavily on the analysis by Jennings and Stoker of differences in the electoral performance of Labour and the Conservatives in towns and cities \[ **3.2**, **3.3**\], and used the measure of relative decline promoted by the research \[ **3.2**, **3.5**\]. It has also been noted in reports by the *Institute for Public Policy Research* \(‘The State of the North 2017’ and ‘The State of the North 2018’ \[ **5.1**\]\) and *Hope Not Hate* \(‘Hope, Fear and Loss’ \[ **5.1**\]\). The idea of ‘Two Englands’ was described as *“persuasive”* by Conservative think tank *Onward* in its 2019 report ‘The Politics of Belonging’ \[ **5.1**\]. Rosie Carter of *Hope Note Hate* observes: “ *I think the “Two Englands” study is one that people talk about all the time, they just refer to the “Two Englands” and people know exactly what you’re talking about*” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 ii. <ins>I</ins><ins>nforming and advancing the national policy agenda on towns v</ins><ins>ia the Centre for Towns</ins> 

 The research has also been central to the creation of a new think tank, the Centre for Towns \(CfT\), which through a range of projects and collaborations has been highly influential in informing and advancing the emerging policy agenda on towns, promoting the importance of place\-sensitive approaches to public policy. CfT was founded in October 2017 by Lisa Nandy MP, Ian Warren \(a political data analyst\) and Jennings. As noted, the work of Jennings and Stoker on ‘Two Englands’ and the growing divide in values and outlooks between particular places had previously been taken up by Nandy, and CfT built directly on the intellectual foundations of this research. Nandy says “ *The Two Englands study was the catalyst for setting up the Centre for Towns*” \[ **5.2**\]. Since the launch of CfT, Nandy notes “ *we have actively challenged the thinking which has informed major political parties and much of local government for decades. It has led to a flurry of reports on towns from established think tanks, debates in Westminster, widespread media coverage of towns – almost all of which featured Centre for Towns because we have largely been the only source of information about our towns*” \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The activities of CfT have significantly enhanced understanding of the issues affecting towns and resulted in increased political attention to towns in public policy, as well as promoting the use of data in this area. It has done so through its own reports and through a number of collaborations with external stakeholders \[ **5.4**\]. These include reports produced jointly with *Hope Not Hate* \(on attitudes towards social change\), *Ernst and Young* \(on trends in Foreign Direct Investment in towns and cities\) \[ **5.5**\], the *Royal Institute of British Architects* \(on ageing and housing\), the *BBC* \(on identity and place\), and the *Yorkshire Post* \(relating to challenges posed to the region by demographic trends\). As such, via Jennings’ contribution to the CfT, this body of research has significantly advanced understanding of geographical inequalities in a range of policy domains for a number of audiences – including stakeholders within those domains and also for policymakers, media and the public. Analysis by Centre for Towns has been mentioned *nine times* in debates in UK Parliament \(including at PMQs\) and in motions in UK Parliament and the Welsh Assembly \[ **5.1**\]. Sarah Longlands of think tank IPPR North has said “ *People like Centre for Towns have really helped to propel towns further up the list of priorities*” \[ **5.3**\]. Will Tanner, former Deputy Head of the Number 10 Policy Unit and Founder of the think tank *Onward* says “ *I think the Centre for Towns is clearly one of the leading voices \[in the towns debate\]. The work that Will, Ian and Lisa have done over the last few years has been exemplary in terms of making people think about towns as a unit of economic and social analysis*” \[ **5.3**\]. 

 There is clear evidence that research by CfT influenced the UK government’s £3.6 billion Towns Fund. Jennings was consulted by the Cities and Local Growth Unit of the Ministry for Communities, Housing and Local Government \(MCHLG\) in August 2019 on the future shape of the fund \(phone call with Team Leader – Regeneration Investment, 27 August 2019\). The Towns Fund prospectus \[ **5.6**\] published in November 2019 cited the CfT/EY report on trends of FDI in towns and cities \[ **5.5**\] on page 5 in its discussion of the economic challenges faced by towns, in addition to making reference to housing, transport and digital connectivity \(links to CfT reports relating to these areas were shared with MCHLG via email on 27<sup>th</sup> August 2019, indicating a clear link between analysis by CfT and the policy issues addressed by the Towns Fund\). Following that consultation, MCHLG indicated “ *We’re incredibly grateful for your advice and evidence which* **helped to inform the Towns Fund prospectus**” \[ **5.7**\]. 

 Significantly, the typology of places developed by Jennings and Warren for the Centre for Towns has since been adapted in an official geographical classification of parliamentary constituencies according to the size of settlement by the House of Commons Library. The Library notes that for their scheme of constituencies “ *settlements are classified according to an adjusted version of the taxonomy recently developed by the Centre for Towns*”. \[ **5.8**\] The Office for National Statistics has also since introduced its own prototype classification similarly based on the size of urban settlements, reflecting the influence of the CfT typology \[ **5.9**\]. As such, this research has motivated and informed the classification of official statistics relating to towns and cities. Yvette Cooper \(MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford and also Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee\) has argued: *“That’s why the Centre for Towns … is so important. The truth is it is hard to get good evidence to compare towns, because no one properly collects it. Policy makers look at regions or local authority districts or households but rarely at the actual geography that defines people’s lives.”* \[ **5.1**\] Will Tanner has noted: “ *There are huge benefits of constructing datasets that allow for that type of analysis to be done in a way that can influence policy. Clearly the Centre for Towns is one of the leading contributors to that debate*.” \[ **5.3**\] Nandy herself traces the significance of the research from shifting political debate to having a substantive impact on public policy: 

 *“Perhaps the most significant thing for me about Two Englands is that it’s hard to think of a single study that has not just shaken up political thinking, but had an impact on people themselves. We launched Centre for Towns with a study by Will Jennings that showed people in towns were significantly more likely to feel politicians didn’t care about them or their area. In my frequent interactions with people across the country, I get a real sense that has now changed. That is quite an extraordinary achievement.”* \[ **5.2**\] 

 More generally, the activities of CfT have directly shifted the national agenda on towns, leading to high levels of media coverage \(a systematic search of Nexis using related terms identifies 177 news articles between January 2016 and July 2020\) \[ **5.1**\]. 

 iii. <ins>Shaping</ins> <ins>c</ins><ins>overage of</ins> <ins>British elections by Sky News</ins> 

 Research by Jennings and Stoker, in collaboration with the Centre for Towns, has shaped Sky News’ coverage of British politics, most notably the 2019 general election. Sky News took up the theme of towns as the key battleground for the next general election – with analysis for Sky online in October 2018 by Jennings of the top marginal constituencies in England, Wales and Scotland highlighting the concentration of most marginals in town\-focused constituencies \[ **5.1**\]. Through contributing to internal briefing papers for Sky News, Jennings’ analysis directly influenced its ‘Path to Power’ concept used to tell the story of the campaign and informed the selection of constituencies for live broadcast visits \[ **5.10**\]. Nick Phipps, Editor of election night programmes for Sky News says “ *Jennings’ understanding of change in British electoral politics ensured that Sky News was able to provide our audience with the definitive account of the general election among all national broadcasters – allowing us to anticipate key stories of the election and explain why they mattered to our viewers. It meant that Sky News was months ahead of everyone else in highlighting the critical importance of towns to the election*” \[ **5.11**\]. In his role with Sky News, Jennings also advised on the selection of appropriate economic, social and political indicators for the profiling of constituencies, and on how these data might be visualised. The profiles were used on screen during coverage of the campaign and in online articles about specific constituencies. In addition to providing Sky News with the relevant data for all 650 UK parliamentary constituencies, working with Michael Thrasher \(Sky’s Senior Election Analyst\) Jennings constructed a national index of constituency deprivation \(based on the Index of Multiple Deprivation, but extended to incorporate Scotland and Northern Ireland which are not included in the IMD\). This index was also used in the constituency profiles and in election night coverage of the results. 

 On Sky News’ election night programme in December 2019, Jennings was responsible for analysis of voting patterns at constituency level and in particular their correspondence to demographics – writing reports on the Slack internal messaging system and providing briefings and analysis to Deputy Political Editor Sam Coates and Economics Editor Ed Conway – who were responsible for analysing the results in the election coverage. As part of that analysis, Sky News made use of the Centre for Towns typology, reporting the national swing differentiated by urban settlement size, whereby the Conservatives did better in smaller towns and made smaller gains in major cities. 

 Director of Newsgathering and Operations for Sky News, Jonathan Levy, says \[ **5.11**\] “ *Jennings’ expertise in British electoral politics and data analysis has enabled us to reach new levels in our use of data visualisation in coverage of UK elections*”. Ed Conway said: “ *The data analysis provided by Jennings on election night was crucial in enabling us to reliably and engagingly tell the story of the election to viewers – via both broadcast and online. Sky News was widely recognised to have provided the most compelling in\-depth coverage of the election and Jennings’ data analysis and visualisation was vital to that*.” \[ **5.11**\] 

 Research by Jennings and Stoker has therefore significantly and directly informed and supported election coverage by one of the UK’s major national broadcasters – from the level of providing a broad conceptual framework to assisting with technical design of data visualisation and analysis.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research conducted at the University of Nottingham \(UoN\) has provided evidence of the effectiveness of Syngenta’s new Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> seedcare products against soil\-borne pathogenic threats causing root diseases in wheat and oilseed rape \(OSR\). Syngenta, a leading global agriculture company, utilised UoN research outcomes from 2017 to establish a new ‘biostimulant and root health’ market within the seedcare and crop protection areas. UoN research provided industry confidence in Syngenta’s new Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> seedcare products, and supported product uptake, with significant market traction achieved for Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> Duo. UK wheat farmers who adopted Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> Duo have realised yield increases equivalent to additional UK farm business income of GBP24,083,400 per annum \(2019\). UoN research also provided Syngenta with critical evidence to support the ‘biostimulant’ label claim and international product registration of a range of Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> seedcare products. Specifically, UoN research outcomes enabled Syngenta and a major EU OSR seed company to achieve emergency registration for \[redacted\] of Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> OSR in 2020.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Modern farming utilises active fungicides as part of crop management to combat plant diseases that can severely reduce crop yield but are not adequately controlled by non\-chemical methods. The introduction of the EU pesticide framework directive \(2009/128/EC\) in 2009 aimed at minimising the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment. This resulted in restrictions on crop protection active ingredients including main seed treatments \(eg thiram\) effective against soil\-borne pathogens. The new legislation led to a void in seed protection and an urgent need for novel crop protection products and integrative control strategies to minimise yield losses from significant abiotic and biotic stresses occurring at crop establishment. Fundamental and applied understanding of the physiological and protective action of seed protection products \(such as fungicides\) is required to optimise use within crop management in different environments to achieve new product registrations. In response to these challenges, Dr Rumiana Ray from the University of Nottingham \(UoN\) collaborated with Syngenta, a leading global agriculture company, on a series of research projects between 2008 and 2020 to determine the effects of a novel class of fungicide \(succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor \- SDHI\) on the protection of wheat and oilseed rape \(OSR\) under abiotic and biotic stress. Wheat is the most extensively grown crop in the UK \(1,816,000ha\), while OSR is the third most extensively grown crop \(530,000ha;  [Defra – Farming Statistics](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/865769/structure-jun2019final-uk-22jan20-rev_v2.pdf), 2019\). These crops are critical to UK farming, generating farm income of GBP3,027,000,000 in 2019 \( [Defra –  Total income from farming in the UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/884101/agricaccounts-tiffstatsnotice-07may20i.pdf), 2020\). 

 **Mechanisms and effect of novel crop protection in wheat under abiotic stress** 

 The succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor \(SDHI\) class of fungicides is the fastest growing in terms of new compounds produced and launched onto the crop protection market. SDHIs offer broad spectrum control of fungi by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. Fungicide effects of increased resilience and yield of wheat under abiotic stress \(eg drought stress\) in the absence of disease have been reported by growers in the farming press but the basis of this phenomenon was not understood. 

 To provide information on the mechanism of these effects, initial UoN research centred on the SDHI isopyrazam, applied as foliar fungicide application on wheat grown under drought stress in controlled conditions and in field **\(G1\)**. The results showed that the application of isopyrazam improved wheat biomass \(up to 28%\) and increased yield \(up to 4%\) in the absence of disease; these effects were associated with increased efficiency of photosystem II \(PSII\) \(up to 24%\) and photosynthesis **\(1\)**. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory genetic mechanisms underlying the observed physiological responses of SDHI\-treated plants, further UoN research used a second generation SDHI, sedaxane, formulated as a seed treatment **\(G2\)**. This work integrated whole plant physiological responses with changes in the global gene expression in the seed, leaf and root tissues of plants subjected to drought stress. Physiological analysis confirmed improved wheat photosynthetic efficiency and increased seedling biomass \(dry weight\) by 37% under drought stress following treatment with sedaxane **\(2\)**. Gene expression analysis revealed that sedaxane altered the plant physiological response to environmental stress by redirecting plant metabolism from defence towards adaptive development and growth **\(2\)**. The research found that the increase in biomass following SDHI treatment **\(1,2\)** was also associated with changes in plant architecture **\(2\)**. 

 **Mechanisms and effect of novel crop protection in wheat and OSR under biotic stress** 

 *Rhizoctonia solani* anastomosis group \(AG\) 2\-1 and *R. cerealis* are soil\-borne pathogens causing pre\- and post\-emergence damping\-off and impaired crop establishment in OSR and wheat \(respectively\). One of the major challenges in developing appropriate integrative control strategies for these soil\-borne pathogens is to accurately identify infected farm fields in need of targeted treatment prior to crop seed sowing. 

 To address this challenge, UoN research **\(G3\)** developed a highly specific and sensitive TaqMan real\-time PCR assay that can detect and differentiate *Rhizoctonia cerealis* in the soil matrix **\(3\).** The assay was used to test 102 field soils in England over the period of 2 years and it was found that *R. cerealis* and *R. solani* AG 2\-1 predominated in more than 68% of fields tested **\(4\)**. Using the assay developed and tested in wheat **\(3,4\)**, UoN research undertaken within a collaborative Innovate UK project lead by Syngenta \(Integrating Control strategies Against soil\-borne Rhizoctonia solani in OilSeed rape – ICAROS\) **\(G4\)** provided detailed understanding on the prevalence of *Rhizoctonia* spp. in UK and EU soils and identified crops and fields at risk from infection **\(5\)**. 

 Further research focussed on the development of control strategies, inclusive of an effective seed treatment, to protect crop establishment in infected fields. Sedaxane is the first SDHI seed treatment to act against soil\-borne *Rhizoctonia spp.* UoN research showed that, when used in formulation with fludioxonil, sedaxane significantly increased establishment and yield of wheat and OSR in infected fields. Research showed that in OSR, this was through reducing pathogen DNA in soil and *in planta* **\(5\)**. Sedaxane was also found to protect lateral root development, increase root length and volume in OSR seedlings in soils infected with *R. solani* AG2\-1 **\(5\)**.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Syngenta are a leading global agriculture company with sales in seedcare products of USD1,100,000,000 \( [Syngenta Global, 2019](https://www.syngenta.com/company/media/syngenta-news/year/2020/2019-full-year-results)\). Syngenta’s major seedcare brands include  [Vibrance™](https://www.syngentaseedcare.com/vibrance) for broad spectrum disease control for all major crops and optimum protection against *Rhizoctonia* spp. Vibrance™ includes sedaxane, a fungicide in the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor \(SDHI\) class, which has a biostimulant effect. Syngenta’s expanding Vibrance™ portfolio includes Vibrance™ Duo for wheat, Vibrance™ Gold for other cereals, and Vibrance™ OSR for oilseed rape \(OSR\). Dr Rumiana Ray, University of Nottingham \(UoN\), played a key role in evaluating the performance of the Vibrance™ active ingredient \(sedaxane\) in wheat and OSR. UoN research delivered key outcomes that have been used by Syngenta since 2017 to support international registration and launch of the new Vibrance™ products. This has enabled Syngenta to establish a new ‘biostimulant and root health’ market. Furthermore, the fundamental mechanistic understanding provided by UoN research has increased industry confidence in the Vibrance™ product portfolio and uptake by end users. 

 **UoN research contributed to ‘biostimulant and root health’ market position and uptake of Vibrance™** 

 UoN research showed that sedaxane had a biostimulant effect and provided comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms resulting in improved crop performance under abiotic stress \(eg drought\) **\(2\)**. This directly contributed to innovation within Syngenta’s crop protection product portfolio through providing Syngenta with critical scientific evidence to establish a new ‘biostimulant and root health’ market **\(a\)** and to register and sell Vibrance™ fungicide packages with ‘biostimulant’ label claims **\(b\)**. Syngenta first used the biostimulant label claim on Vibrance™ Gold, a cereal fungicide package which improved seedling establishment, which was registered in France \(2017\) after independent verification of the biostimulant effect **\(b\)**. 

 Subsequently, Syngenta used the biostimulant label claim on Vibrance™ Duo, a broad spectrum seed treatment registered in 2017 for the control of a range of soil\-borne diseases in winter wheat, winter triticale, winter rye, spring oats and barley in Europe **\(b\)**. Vibrance™ Duo substantially boosted crop growth **\(2\)** and the contribution made by UoN towards understanding the physiological response in wheat was recognised in Vibrance™ Duo marketing literature, including the  [product landing page](https://www.syngenta.co.uk/vibrance-duo), post\-launch  [product update](https://www.syngenta.co.uk/news/product-update/beneficial-fungicide-side-effects-could-be-root-better-crop-health) and product brochure **\(c\)**. Acknowledging the contribution of UoN research, Syngenta’s former Technical & Solutions Manager for Seedcare stated, *‘Syngenta have worked with Dr Rumiana Ray on developing our understanding of the new seed treatment active substance, sedaxane… considerably \[enhancing\] our understanding of sedaxane and \[facilitating\] its successful introduction in the UK and other markets. \[...With\] Dr Ray we were able to show that under drought stress that sedaxane was able to up regulate certain genes which allowed wheat plants to more effectively photosynthesise than untreated plants \[… demonstrating\] that the product has properties over and above fungicidal action. \[…\] **Dr Ray’s** **research has been extremely valuable in helping to position sedaxane in a highly technical and competitive market, allowing us to quickly gain industry confidence and market traction’* **\(a\).** 

 To establish the ‘biostimulant and root health’ market, provide industry wide confidence in Vibrance™ Duo product claims and support product uptake, Dr Ray was invited to present findings of the UoN research **\(2\)** and crop trials at Syngenta’s Vibrance™ Duo European product launch \(March 2017, UK\) **\(a\)**. The event was attended by 100 companies representing Syngenta’s European key corporate account holders for crop protection. Dr Ray was also invited to speak at multiple Syngenta annual Root Health Forums \(5 invitations, 2013 onwards\), providing scientific information and knowledge directly to global industry and research communities to facilitate the uptake of Vibrance™ **\(d\)**. Through the support of Dr Ray in establishing and disseminating the strong scientific basis for Vibrance™ Duo product claims, Syngenta have quickly gained industry confidence and market traction for Vibrance™ Duo **\(a\)**. Syngenta estimate that **60% of UK farm advisors were aware of the benefits of using the product \(2019\). Furthermore, 20% of UK farmers were using Vibrance™ Duo and realising the crop establishment benefits on wheat \(2019\) \(a\)**. *‘\[Syngenta\] also used the data to support subsequent launches of the product in 21 EAME \[Europe, Africa and the Middle East\] countries between 2017 and 2020. Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> Duo is a strong product in this region, with an average uptake of 80% in wheat farmers \[…\] Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> Duo was surely the starting point and since then we have launched a series of new products containing this technology within the evolution of our portfolio. Rumiana Ray had a huge impact on the general technology and marketing message map behind the active ingredient sedaxane’* **\(b\)**. 

 **UoN research contributed to yield and farm income increases** 

 UK wheat farmers face increased threats from soil\-borne pathogens causing yield reduction due to losses in emergence and establishment **\(3\-5\)**. The launch of Vibrance™ Duo provided a new solution for farmers for improved crop establishment and protection of root health. Syngenta conducted further field trials to quantify the yield benefits to farmers on a commercial scale. Syngenta trials across 64 UK farms showed Vibrance™ Duo increased wheat yields an average of 0.34\-0.51 t/h across two soil types and cropping rotations **\(a\)**. Based on Defra  [Farm Business Survey](http://www.farmbusinesssurvey.co.uk/) wheat production data \(UK wheat area and price per tonne\), assuming no change in input costs or output prices, a yield enhancement of 0.41 t/h from a 20% UK wheat area adoption of Vibrance™ Duo, provided an **additional UK farm business income \(profit\) of GBP24,083,400 per annum** **\(2019\) \(e\)**. 

 **UoN research supports Vibrance™ OSR product registrations** 

 The EU restriction on crop protection actives in 2018 left a gap in the seed protection market, with the leading thiram\-based treatments being no longer approved for EU and UK use in OSR. *Rhizoctonia* spp. cause a wide range of commercially significant crop diseases yet little is known about the prevalence of soil\-borne pathogens in soils as they are difficult to detect. Using novel molecular assays **\(3\-5\)**, UoN provided Syngenta and EU regulatory authorities with information on the prevalence of *Rhizoctonia* spp. in UK and EU soils and identified crops/fields at risk from infection **\(5\)**. Specifically, research within the Innovate UK ICAROS project **\(G4\)** has been used to inform expansion of the Vibrance™ product portfolio to include protection for OSR in the EU, marketed as Vibrance™ OSR **\(b\)**. Acknowledging the role UoN research has played in this area, Syngenta’s Seedcare Technical Expert EAME \(Europe, Africa, Middle East\) stated, ‘ *Syngenta have the chemistry but not always the ability to identify pathogens which need to be targeted. **The collaboration with Dr Ray has been unique for Syngenta, allowing us to access detection tools not available anywhere else**. \[…\] **The ICAROS project has paved the way for Vibrance™ OSR registration** **our first commercial seed treatment to act against Rhizoctonia solani’** **\(b\).** 

 **UoN research drives demand for Vibrance™ from seed companies** 

 Sedaxane, as part of Vibrance™ is the first Syngenta molecule developed specifically for seed treatment, as such, market access requires uptake from seed companies. The ICAROS project demonstrated to seed companies that Vibrance™ provides best in class protection against *Rhizoctonia* spp. **\(5\)** and generated significant interest amongst OSR seed companies. Specifically, Norddeutsche Pflanzenzucht Innovation \(NPZ\), who hold the largest market for OSR seeds in the EU, travelled to the UK to view UoN field trials **\(f\)**. Based on UoN results that demonstrated a strong effect of Vibrance™ OSR on *R. solani* AG2\-1, NPZ requested Syngenta arrange emergency product registration in Germany to enable testing using NPZ seed. This allowed Syngenta to sell an initial \[redacted\] of Vibrance™ OSR to NPZ \(June – Sept 2020\) **\(b\)**. Acknowledging the role UoN and Syngenta’s collaborative research has played in this area, NPZ’s Seed Technology Manager stated that these research outcomes had led to a change in their crop product registration portfolio strategy, *‘Dr Ray’s findings have demonstrated the potential impact R. solani AG2\-1 can have on OSR, which has led us to continue to monitor for R. solani in our winter OSR crop and extend the monitoring in our trial network. \[…\] **The ICAROS project \[supported\] our decision to request Vibrance<sup>TM</sup> OSR from Syngenta and hence support them in their application for emergency registration**. The ICAROS project has increased our awareness of R. solani AG2\-1 as an OSR pathogen and provided evidence for the efficacy of Virbance<sup>TM</sup> OSR and we are continuing to work with Syngenta to make the product available to OSR growers in key EU countries’* **\(f\)**. 

 **Summary** 

 Pivotal research conducted by UoN has increased industry confidence and uptake of Syngenta’s first broad spectrum seedcare brand Vibrance™. Research outcomes have underpinned UK sales of Vibrance™ Duo and yield benefits have been realised by the 20% of UK wheat farmers who have adopted Vibrance™ Duo as part of their crop protection strategies. This has led to a cumulative additional UK farm business income of GBP24,083,400 per annum \(2019\). Vibrance™ OSR has gained significant pre\-registration market traction as the ICAROS project demonstrated the need for Vibrance™ OSR to protect against *R.solani* AG2\-1. A major OSR seed company requested emergency product registration, which allowed Syngenta to trade \[redacted\] of product between June and September 2020.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research conducted at the University of Bristol \(UoB\) led directly to the introduction of adalimumab around the world for treatment of children with uveitis. Previously there were no licensed or approved therapies for children with uveitis. The SYCAMORE study demonstrated overwhelming efficacy of adalimumab \(anti\-TNF agent\) in children with sight threatening eye disease \(uveitis\). Presentation of initial results led to unprecedented next day approval by NHS England and adalimumab has since been approved for use in 76 countries, as well as the European Medicines Agency and the US Federal Drugs Agency. It is estimated over 33,400 children in the US, Europe and Canada alone, have benefited from the treatment to April 2020. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 UoB research led by Prof Andrew Dick published the original description of the benefit of neutralisation of tumour necrosis factor \(TNF\) in mouse models of the rare eye inflammation condition, uveitis, and elucidated the detrimental mechanisms of action of TNF in models of uveitis \[1\]. Following the discovery that this pivotal cytokine was instrumental in tissue destruction during uveitis, the research group developed a translational pathway to demonstrate clinical benefit, using a p55 TNF receptor fusion protein in humans. Translating through, the study generated a proof of concept, illustrating that 70% of refractory adult non\-infectious uveitis patients achieved remission \[2\]. 

 Following pre\-clinical and clinical early phase translation, other groups also showed potential of clinical benefit in cohort studies of anti\-TNF therapies in uveitis in adults and children. In adults, Prof Dick was Co\-Investigator and UK lead for three clinical trials investigating the fully human anti\-TNF monoclonal antibody, adalimumab. Developed and funded by the US based biopharmaceutical company Abbvie \(formerly Abbott\), they investigated the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in active \(VISUAL I\) and inactive \(VISUAL II\) uveitis, followed by an evaluation of extended treatment \(VISUAL III\) \[e.g. 3\]. 

 From 2005, a combined clinic led by Prof Dick and Prof Ramanan was initiated to provide better clinical care for children. The need for a prospective RCT of anti\-TNF in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis uveitis \(JIA\-U\) was identified as the most important unmet research priority across UK and North America. 

 The SYCAMORE \(SafetY and Cost\-effectiveness of Adalimumab in Combination with MethOtRExate\) trial for JIA\-U, funded by National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) and Arthritis Research UK \(ARUK\) \[i\] and sponsored by University Hospitals Bristol \(UH Bristol\) NHS Foundation Trust, ran between 2011 and 2017. The trial was a randomised, parallel\-group, double\-blind, multicentre study, to compare adalimumab versus a placebo, in children receiving a stable dose of methotrexate for active JIA\-U \[4, 5\]. The study target size was 114 participants aged between 2 and 18 with JIA\-U. By early 2015, 90 participants had been recruited; however, an interim data analysis showed that adalimumab was overwhelmingly more effective than the placebo. In April 2015, the Trial Steering Committee recommended recruitment to the trial should cease and that participants in the active arm \(adalimumab\) should continue to be followed up. The trial then ran to completion in an open\-label phase containing only participants continuing treatment with adalimumab. Results from the double\-blind phase \[4\], were supported by integrated analysis of both double\-blind, and open\-label phase data \[5\], revealing that adalimumab significantly controlled inflammation and reduced the rate of treatment failure. 

 The SYCAMORE study was also the first to undertake prospective cost\-effectiveness using patient health utilisation data \[6\]. The results highlighted that a price reduction of 84% would be necessary for adalimumab to be cost\-effective compared with methotrexate alone in the United Kingdom setting.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis \(JIA\) affects 1 in 1000 children with about a third of these children developing inflammation in the eye \(Uveitis\), which can be sight\-threatening. JIA associated uveitis \(JIA\-U\) leads to significant visual impairment in more than half the children with this condition. 

 Prior to the SYCAMORE trial \[4, 5\] there were no licensed or approved therapies for children with uveitis. In 2015, the study was unmasked early by the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee \[4, 5\] due to overwhelming efficacy and to avoid exposing more children to placebo. These initial results were first presented by Prof Ramanan to the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting on 10th November 2015 \[Aii\]. In an unprecedented response, the day after presentation of results, interim access to this expensive medicine was approved by NHS England, with direct reference to the SYCAMORE trial \[Ai \(11<sup>th</sup> November 2015\), H\]. 

#  Approval of Adalimumab Globally 

 This is one of the first investigator\-initiated studies in a rare disease that has led to a pharmaceutical company, Abbvie, who supplied the investigational medicinal product adalimumab \(Humira\) for SYCAMORE, negotiating a data sharing agreement with University Hospital Bristol \(UH Bristol\) to access data for licensing and market authorisation. Following this agreement, Abbvie submitted the data \(citing the SYCAMORE study\) to the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) leading to approval in 2017 \[Bi\]. Approval from the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) followed this in 2018 \[Bii\], and Health Canada in 2019 \[Biii\]. To date, SYCAMORE has led to approval of adalimumab in JIA\-U in more than 76 countries \[C\]. Both EMA and FDA have approved adalimumab for wider indication than the trial population, which led to substantially more children benefiting from this drug \(estimated over 30,000 in North America and Europe\). 10,000 children in the US have benefitted from treatment with adalimumab \[C\] \(\~ 0.003% of US population\). Using estimates of population \(Europe: 740 million, Canada: 40 million\), we estimated 23,400 children in Europe and Canada alone will have benefitted. 

#  Changes to International Health Guidelines 

 The SYCAMORE trial has also led to new guidelines for management of children with uveitis across Europe, the US and internationally. Findings from the trial \[4\] were cited in a 2018 consensus statement by a European initiative, the Single Hub and Access point for paediatric Rheumatology \(SHARE\), providing recommendations for the management of JIA\-U \[D\]. The consensus specifically noted that the SYCAMORE study improved the quality of the evidence from level 3 to level 1, relating to Recommendation 1:5 *‘In case of methotrexate inefficacy or intolerance, adding or switching to biological treatment is recommended’* \[D\]. In 2019, an update to the German Ophthalmological Society guideline for anti\-inflammatory treatment of JIA\-U \[E\] cited the SYCAMORE trial \[4\] among evidence for the use of Adalimumab, concluding that it was the preferred anti\-TNF therapy for JIA\-U \[E\]. The American College of Rheumatology Guideline \(2019\) also recommends adalimumab or infliximab, over alternative anti\-TNF therapies and cited evidence from the SYCAMORE study \[4\], describing it as the only *‘well\-conducted RCT on the use of adalimumab and methotrexate in children’* \[F\]. 

 In 2018, an international consensus report from the Fundamentals of Care for UveitiS \(FOCUS\) initiative, recommended adalimumab \(grade A recommendation\) for treatment of non\-infectious uveitis in adults, and cited SYCAMORE \[4\] as evidence for the benefit in juvenile patients \[G\]. The guidance for treatment of adults also draws heavily on evidence from the VISUAL trials led in the UK by Prof Dick \[e.g. 3\]. The VISUAL trials also played a fundamental role in the recommendation of the use of adalimumab for the treatment of non\-infectious uveitis in adults by the NHS \(2017\). 

#  Benefits to Health and Well\-being 

 The SYCAMORE trial demonstrated clear short\-term therapeutic benefit, including excellent visual acuity results \[4, 5\]. A 5\-year follow\-up of the SYCAMORE trial highlighted a longer\-term role for adalimumab in the treatment of refractory JIA\-U \[I\]. Dick and Ramanan are the Bristol lead investigators for a current US\-funded trial \(ADJUST\), investigating the length of time treatment with adalimumab continues to be effective in children. 

 In 2007, Prof Dick and Prof Ramanan hosted a meeting in Bristol to bring together for the first time the Rheumatologists and Ophthalmologists managing paediatric uveitis, and gain consensus for the development of a paediatric programme for trials in paediatric uveitis. This generated public and patient support through engagement with the patient\-led charity Olivia’s Vision, who provide information, support and advice for anyone affected by uveitis. Prof Dick and Prof Ramanan both act as expert members of the medical advisory board for the charity \[J\]. 

#  Health Economics 

 The SYCAMORE study was the first study to undertake prospective cost\-effectiveness using patient health utilisation data and provided a clear demonstration of the importance and benefits of this approach \[6, H\]. The results highlighted that a price reduction of 84% would be necessary for adalimumab to be cost\-effective compared with methotrexate alone in the United Kingdom setting \[6\]. Adalimumab is now off patent, and the study has provided information for the change in drug cost, permitting accessibility to treatment across England and Wales \[H\]. The Pharmacy Lead, Specialised Commissioning for NHS England noted that *‘This HE study will have helped benchmark pricing for adalimumab biosimilar and for other manufacturers when setting pricing for new therapies in this indication’* \[H\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Surrey has a longstanding reputation in the world of tourism demand forecasting research. Our continuous advancements and innovations in forecasting methodologies have been widely applied by international organisations, government agencies and tourism\-related enterprises and so contributed to “evidence\-based policy/strategy movement”. 

 Our research has provided the scientific foundation for more effective policy\-making, strategic planning and operation management, particularly in terms of planning investments in visitor infrastructure, human resource management, marketing resource allocation and new product development. In addition, the risks of project failures are minimised through improved understanding of tourism demand. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The University of Surrey has been one of the world leaders in tourism demand modelling and forecasting research, led by the research team above. Over the past two decades, the team have been enhancing tourism demand modelling and forecasting methodologies to improve their explanatory power and forecast accuracy. 

  

 For example, the team introduced the “general\-to\-specific” approach to tourism demand modelling, which is a scientific procedure to identify significant influencing factors of tourism demand **\[R1\]** and overcomes the drawbacks of the traditional “simple\-to\-general” method which led to ad hoc model specifications and forecasting biases. In addition, the team developed a number of advanced econometric models including the time\-varying\-parameter \(TVP\) model **\[R2\]**, TVP almost ideal demand system \(AIDS\) model **\[R3\]**, TVP structural time series model **\[R4\]**, and multi\-series structural time series model **\[R5\].** These models all belong to the state space models, which discompose a time series into distinctive components such as trend, season and cycle, by which the dynamic characteristic of a series can be fully captured. In addition, the evolution of tourism demand elasticities can be captured; in other words, these models are able to investigate tourists’ behavioural changes over time. 

 Further research by the Surrey team showed that the combination of these advanced econometric techniques leads to more powerful tools for international tourism demand analysis and forecasting, and improved forecast accuracy **\[R6\]**. The models the team have developed represent the most advanced econometric methods for tourism demand modelling and forecasting in the world, in terms of the sophistication of model specifications, and their forecasting performance. 

  

 Most of the research activities were awarded public funding from various sources. In addition, on the basis of Professor Gang Li and the research team’s expertise in tourism forecasting, a number of 

 international organisations and enterprises commissioned a series of projects which applied these innovative forecasting tools. These included: 

-  A sustained contractual relationship with the Pacific Asia Travel Association \(PATA\) which applies the methods of Song and Witt **\[R1\]** and Li, et al., **\[R2\]** to produce their annual Asia Pacific Visitor Forecast reports. 

-  A European Commission\-funded project \(68/PP/ENT/PPA/12/6470\) based on the forecasting methods of Li, et al., **\[R2\]** to predict future demand for accessible tourism in Europe. 

-  The development of a web\-based forecasting system for Hong Kong inbound tourism \(www.tourismforecasting.net\). The forecasting system for Hong Kong is the only one of its type in the world and enables non\-expert users to adjust the forecasts based on their own judgement. The statistical forecasting methodology of the system was developed by the team when all were serving at Surrey \(e.g., Song and Witt **\[R2\]**; Li et al., **\[R2\]**\). The system received a Silver award in the 6th International Exhibition of Inventions in 2008. 

  

 To acknowledge his outstanding research contribution, Gang Li received a number of awards, such as the “University Researcher of the Year 2012”; he was also ranked 12<sup>th</sup> in the world for significant contribution to tourism research, based on the number of publications in top 3 tourism journals during 2004\-2013.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Accurate tourism demand forecasts derived from the innovative forecasting methods developed by the research team provide a scientific foundation for formulating effective tourism policies \(e.g., planning investments in infrastructure, marketing resource allocation and using tourism to drive regional development\) and successful business strategies \(e.g., operation management, marketing, business investment and new product/market development\). Our research therefore contributed to “evidence\-based policy/strategy movement” of tourism organisations and destination governments. The main beneficiaries of our research are the organisations that commissioned the team to conduct consultancy projects or directly adopted our forecasting methodologies and reports. 

  

###  1. Pacific Asia Travel Association \(PATA\) 

 The strongest example of direct impact of the methodologies developed by the research team comes from the relationship with PATA. Since 1951, PATA has been the key membership association driving the development of travel and tourism to, from and within the Asia Pacific region. Since 2012, the research team has been commissioned to produce PATA’s annual visitor forecasting reports. These are made available to all PATA members: comprising 95 government, state and city tourism bodies, 25 international airlines and airports, 108 hospitality organisations, and hundreds of travel industry companies in Asia Pacific and beyond **\[S1\]**. The benefit of these reports to the stakeholders that receive them lies in the accuracy of the forecasts, verified by PATA as accurate to within 3% for one\-year\-ahead predictions. This accuracy allows stakeholders to improve the effectiveness of their strategic planning and reduce the associated risks. Three specific examples illustrate this wider benefit. 

  

###  2. PATA forecasts facilitate tourism policy decision\-making: China Tourism Academy 

 PATA annual forecasting reports, produced by the research team and relying on the methodological innovations detailed in Section 2, support tourism policy change. Many tourist destination governments use PATA forecasts as a key reference to assist their tourism planning and when revising tourism policies. According to PATA’s testimonial **\[S2\]**, PATA forecasts are “a staple asset for every tourism policy\-maker, planner, and strategist with a vested interest in understanding the changing market dynamics of tourism in the Asia Pacific region. Apart from offering a glimpse into emergent market opportunities, they also provide a means of quantifying risk with origin\-destination pairs that might be heading toward a variable cycle of growth and contraction”. 

  

 The China Tourism Academy \(CTA\) is the think tank and research arm of the Chinese state tourism authority and has been using PATA’s forecasts of Chinese inbound and outbound tourist arrivals as a foundation to support their policy research and recommendations to the central government. CTA reports **\[S3\]** that, “ *PATA’s Visitor Forecasts … have become an essential input into CTA’s policy research, which has led to important tourism policy initiatives and supported the central government’s long\-term global development strategy.”* For example, based on the predicted tourism trends between China and neighbouring countries involved in the Chinese government’s “One Belt, One Road” global development strategy, the Chinese government has established China\-ASEAN, China\-Central and East Europe, and China\-Russia\-Mongolia cultural cooperation mechanisms and promoted tourism and cultural exchange as an effective strategy of international relationship development **\[S3\]**. 

###  3. PATA forecasts improved destination marketing: China National Tourist Office 

 Accurate PATA forecasts enabled destination management/marketing organisations’ successful marketing planning and efficient resource allocation in their overseas markets. For example, China National Tourist Office \(CNTO\) in London is in charge of promoting China as a tourist destination in the UK market. Using our forecasts of UK tourist arrivals into China in the PATA reports since 2013, which showed a trend of promising growth of this market in the medium term \(5\-years ahead\), CNTO\-London secured increased investment from the Chinese government, compared to previous years before adopting PATA forecasts. The resulting additional resources allowed CNTO\-London to host a series of promotional affairs to realise the market potential **\[S4\]**. Over 2014\-2018, inbound tourism from the UK to China increased by 6.5% annually, 44% higher than the average growth rate of UK’s outbound tourism during this period \(4.5% per annum\) **\[S5\]**. Similar impacts are seen in other overseas offices of CNTO. 

  

###  4. PATA forecasts improved corporate planning and investment: Dusit Hotels 

 Through PATA forecasts, Surrey’s research also benefits PATA industry members’ short\- and medium\-term business planning such as capital investment in human and resource deployment. The hotel group Dusit Hotels & Resorts, based on PATA predictions of fast growth international tourist arrivals in Southeast Asia, has invested in expanding its network of hotels in Thailand and the Asia Pacific region from 2,782 rooms in 2013 to 5,113 rooms in 2019. As part of its long\-term strategic planning, Dusit expanded its education division and decided to open a new Dusit Hospitality Management College in Manila, in order to grow their own talents and meet the increasing demand for human resources in hospitality in the region where they operate their hotel business **\[S6\]**. 

###  The European Commission 

 Finally, Surrey research forecasted the travel patterns and economic benefits of accessible tourism in Europe, contributing to long\-term policy development on accessible tourism at regional and international levels. In a report commissioned for the European Commission \(EC\) **\[S7\]**, the Surrey team found that the European tourism sector has and will continue to lose out on as much as €142 billion every year due to poor infrastructure, services and attitudes towards travellers with special access needs. 

 The previously unforeseen scale of forecasted demand became a key tool for policy actors to encourage policy momentum for accessible tourism. The director of the European Network of Accessible Tourism explained that the report became and still is *“*a key reference for the sector, which has not been superseded by any other comparable studies these last 6 years. \(…\) It provides a benchmark which other studies and trends can be measured by” **\[S8\]**. 

  

 In line with the report’s recommendation to encourage service providers to invest in accessible tourism, the EC then developed a number of policy initiatives designed to improve the facilitation of accessible tourism and capitalise on this unmet demand. For instance, in response to demand forecasts from the report that predicted 25% growth in demand if accessibility service and infrastructure is improved, the EC allocated €1.7million to support new SME led tourism accessibly programmes across Europe **\[S9\]**. Further Initiatives included the European Excellence Awards for Accessible Tourism **\[S10\]**, and an EU Disability Card which aims to make it easier for people with disabilities to travel across Member States **\[S11\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 According to the ONS, 14.1% of UK adults were smokers in 2019 and more than half want to quit. UCL’s Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group \(UTARG\) has provided underpinning evidence and theory for the annual ‘Stoptober’ public health campaign: a mass national quitting event run annually by Department of Health or Public Health England. UTARG’s evaluation of ‘Stoptober’s first year of operation, published in November 2013, was instrumental in determining continuation of campaign funding in England \(approximately GBP2m per year\). It is estimated that the decision to recommission ‘Stoptober’ has generated an additional 350,000 quit attempts each year since 2013 and saved a total 83,200 discounted life years \(DLY\) up to 2020, at a cost of GBP414.26 per DLY in the modal age group. The UTARG evaluation and engagement were also crucial in decisions to implement similar campaigns in the Netherlands \(since 2014\), France \(since 2016\) and New Zealand \(between 2014 and 2016\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Between 2012 and 2020, England’s Department of Health and Public Health England \(PHE\) \- with substantial direction on four key themes from the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group \(UTARG\) described below \- designed and ran a campaign called ‘Stoptober’. Rather than focusing on the harms of smoking, ‘Stoptober’ aimed to create a positive mass quitting ‘trigger’ and actively support a social movement around a specific activity: stopping smoking for 28 days. UTARG research influenced the need, timing and content of the campaign: 

 **i\) Evidence\-base for impact of national campaigns:** The UK government and voluntary sector charities campaign ‘No Smoking Day’ \(NSD\) has taken place in March throughout England since 1984. It is a national event that aims to help smokers to stop by providing a nationally supportive environment and drawing attention to available treatments. UTARG leads the Smoking Toolkit Study \(STS\), which is a detailed population survey on smoking and smoking cessation that recruits a new representative sample of approximately 1,700 adults each month in England. An evaluation of NSD by UTARG, using STS data, compared reported quit attempts by 3,981 past\-year smokers in the month following NSD for three consecutive years \(from 2007 to 2009\) with adjacent months. It estimated that NSD had generated 238,000 attempts to stop in a population of 8.5 million smokers, at a cost of around GBP750,000 to the No Smoking Day charity **\[R1\]**. This UTARG evaluation contributed to the evidence base for the impact of mass quitting campaigns and helped secure national investment in the ‘Stoptober’ campaigns. 

 **ii\) Evidence to inform the timing of the campaign:** UTARG researchers pointed out that Autumn was a fallow period for quitting activity in England: an analysis of UTARG’s STS data on quit attempts obtained from 31,566 past\-year smokers during monthly household surveys representative of the English population showed that from 2007 to 2011 the rate in October was less than in other months of the same period **\[R2\]**. This UTARG insight established the need for a national cessation campaign to generate a burst of activity around that time and influenced the decision to run ‘Stoptober’ campaigns in October. 

 **iii\) Insight to set a 28\-day challenge: ‘**Stoptober’ campaigns, run by Department of Health and PHE, set people the challenge of being smoke\-free for 28 days starting on 1 October. This call to action was reinforced by the positive message that smokers achieving this goal would be at least five times more likely to become permanent ex\-smokers than they were at the start, having recovered from the worst of the cravings and withdrawal symptoms. This message was based on standard relapse curves produced by research groups, including UTARG **\[R3\]**. The 28\-day target also aimed to help people achieve a difficult behavioural goal \(stopping completely\) by beginning with a realistic intermediary goal, which was objective, well\-specified and bound to a particular target date. The approach was first used in a smartphone app called SmokeFree28 that UTARG developed, using their PRIME theory **\[R4\]**. The app asked users to record whether they had smoked each day, visualised progress towards their 28\-day goal and provided digital quitting tools. A promising preliminary evaluation showed that of 1,170 app users who met the inclusion criteria, 18.9% abstained from smoking for ≥28 days, compared with an estimated 15% quitting success rate for people who were unaided in their attempts to give up smoking **\[R4\]**. 

 **iv\) Underpinning theory:** Another important psychological insight arose from PRIME theory, proposed by two members of UTARG in the book *Theory of Addiction* **\[R5\]**. Their comprehensive theory of motivation argues that behaviour is determined on a moment\-to\-moment basis by a wide variety of motivational inputs, from impulses and inhibitory forces, through desires, drives, and emotional states, to evaluations and plans. It also proposes that the motivational system is inherently unstable and requires constant balancing input to maintain a constant pattern of behaviour. Thus, smokers are most likely to quit successfully if a range of support is provided that targets the whole motivational system, rather than just some elements of it, and aims to both weaken the powerful motivational forces to engage in smoking and create new sources of desire to refrain. Therefore, providing a variety of support to help smokers achieve a smoke\-free month was fundamental to the campaign. This included a postal support pack and digital tools such as a website, peer support via Facebook, a motivational text\-messaging programme and an app providing ongoing encouragement and self\-monitoring tools. 

 **Evaluation:** The UTARG evaluation of the first ‘Stoptober’ campaign used data on quit attempts from 31,566 past\-year smokers, collected during nationally representative monthly household surveys between 2007 and 2012 as part of the UCL STS **\[R2\]**. The effectiveness of the campaign was assessed by the increase in national quit attempt rate in October relative to other months in 2012 vs. 2007 to 2011. Relative to other months in the year, more people tried to quit in October in 2012 compared with 2007 to 2011. In 2012, there was an approximately 50% increase in quitting during October compared with other months of the same year, whereas in 2007 to 2011 the rate in October was less than in other months of the same period. In just one month, ‘Stoptober’ 2012 was estimated to have generated an additional 350,000 quit attempts and, using a standard model for calculating the cost\-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions with the conservative assumption that only 2.5% of these attempts would result in permanent success, the UCL team estimated the first campaign saved 10,400 discounted life years \(DLY\) at GBP414.26 per DLY in the modal age group \(35 to 44\) and GBP557.70 per DLY for the overall population. This compared favourably with other estimates concerning UK anti\-tobacco campaigns, which have ranged between GBP40 and GBP2,000 per DLY gained \(e.g. **\[R1\]**; Raikou and McGuire, 2008; Atusingwize et al, 2015\). An evaluation of subsequent campaigns indicated a prolonged effect over the first six years of ‘Stoptober’ in England. This UTARG research also indicated that effects appeared to be greater when campaigns budgets were higher compared with times of lower campaign spending **\[R6\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **Lives saved from smoking cessation:** Tobacco smoking is estimated to lead to the premature death of approximately 8 million people worldwide and 80,000 people in the UK each year. These premature deaths each typically represent 10 years of life years lost. Smoking cessation is a function of two processes: making an attempt to stop; and succeeding in that attempt. Novel mass media campaigns can stimulate quit attempts and UTARG’s research and theory was pivotal in influencing the design of ‘Stoptober’, a novel mass media smoking cessation campaign run by the Department of Health since 2012 and PHE \(from 2013\). 

 The influence of four key themes of UTARG research on the design of ‘Stoptober’ is summarised in **\[R2\]**, which was co\-authored by Matthew Walmsley at Department of Health and states: *“The English Department of Health with input from an academic partner \(RW\) designed a campaign called ‘Stoptober’*.” These themes have been central to each subsequent iteration of ‘Stoptober’ between October 2013 to 2020 and their ongoing influence on campaign designs is clear in PHE’s Social Marketing Strategy 2014 – 2017 **\[S1\]**, which states, in relation to utilising evidence\-based approaches in public health marketing: *“We use Prime Theory in tobacco control… we have collaborated with… Professor Robert West and his team at University College London \(UCL\) on a wide range of projects”.* These collaborations include frequent contact between UTARG and PHE on tobacco control monitoring, assessment, and strategies, and participation in implementation boards and expert roundtables on tobacco control policy at the Department of Health. The NHS SmokeFree website, which delivered the digital components of the ‘Stoptober’ campaign, publicly acknowledged UCL’s input until April 2020: “ *Our thanks in particular go to Professor Robert West for providing data and analysis from the Smoking Toolkit Study and supporting our campaign and product development with insight and advice*” **\[S2\]**. 

 A UTARG evaluation **\[R2\]** estimated that ‘Stoptober’ led more than a third of a million smokers to try to quit in October 2012 than would otherwise have done \(quit attempts are a commonly used metric in tobacco cessation research, being on the causal pathway to quitting\). Assuming these effects extended from 2013 to 2020, then ‘Stoptober’ saved an estimated 83,200 DLY at a cost to government of GBP414.26 per DLY in the modal age group. This UCL evaluation was also later identified as just one of eleven appropriate studies in a 2015 independent review of economic evaluations of tobacco mass media campaigns, published in *Tobacco Control*. The authors concluded that the UCL study was among the higher quality evaluations \(scoring 7/10 on their quality checklist\) and was an important part of the evidence that led to the conclusion: *“the cost effectiveness of tobacco control mass media campaigns is limited, but of acceptable quality and consistently suggests that they offer good value for money.”* **\[S3\]** 

 **Shaping national commissioning decisions:** The original UTARG evaluation of the first year of operation was critical in the commissioning of ‘Stoptober’ in subsequent years **\[R2\]**. In an article published in the leading French epidemiology and public health journal *Bulletin épidémiologique hebdomadaire*, Professor Kevin Fenton, then the National Director of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, described the UTARG study results and consequences: “ *A study published in 2014 to evaluate how effective and cost\-effective ‘Stoptober’ was in 2012 – the first year of the campaign – found that ‘designing a national public health campaign with a clear behavioural target using key psychological principles can yield substantial behaviour change and public health impact’…*” **\[S4\]**. There is continuing reference to ongoing evaluation in the STS, led by West and Brown, in PHE press releases on ‘Stoptober’, e.g., *“And according to UCL’s Smoking Toolkit Study, smoking rates are continuing to fall in 2014”* **\[S6\]**. The UTARG evaluation is the second reference in the Welcome in PHE’s 2017 to 2020 social marketing strategy and is listed as evidence that “ *Marketing…can encourage behaviours that lead to longer lives, and it can give people the confidence to make healthier choices \(Brown et al, 2014\)”* **\[S1\]**. Three UTARG publications are also listed the strategy’s section on recognition of PHE’s work. 

 **Informing political debate on smoking cessation campaigns:** UTARG evidence on the impact of smoking cessation public campaigns, and the argument for continued spending on them, has been raised in parliament through political debate. UTARG research on the value of tobacco control spending was referenced by Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron’s opening speech of a House of Commons debate on a new Tobacco Control Strategy in December 2015: “ *The cut in spending* \[on mass media campaigns\] *is already having an impact. An early indicator of the effects of reductions in spending on tobacco control is given by the smoking toolkit study run by Professor Robert West, from UCL. Results for 2015 show that smoking prevalence has stopped declining and is beginning to go back up again for the first time in many years.*” **\[S5\]**. 

 This political and policy debate continued into 2020 as a cross\-party issue. In a parliamentary debate on ‘Smokefree England 2030’ in November 2020, Conservative MP and ex\-Public Health Minister Steve Brine noted: “ *The UCL smoking toolkit* **\[R1\]**, **\[R2\]**, **\[R6\]** *indicates that the pandemic has been a driver of quitting among smokers across all social groups, with the highest rate of people stopping smoking seen in the past 30 years. However...there are worrying signs among the 18 to 24\-year\-old group that smoking rates may be increasing*” **\[S5\]**. In December 2020, Public Health Minister Jo Churchill responded: “ *The Department, working with PHE, will develop and publish a new Tobacco Control Plan to deliver its ‘Smokefree 2030’ ambition”* **\[S5\]**. 

 UTARG research was also published to coincide with the start of ‘Stoptober’ 2020: a government press release reported that “ *New data from the UCL Smoking Toolkit Study show that in England in 2020 there has been an increase of nearly a quarter \(22%\) in quit attempts compared to 2019 and an increase of almost two\-thirds in the quitting success rate from 14% to 23%, the highest since at least 2007*” and included quotes from Jo Churchill, and UTARG’s Professor Jamie Brown, who acted as a media spokesperson for the 2020 campaign **\[S6\]**. 

 Engagement with the media has been important in communicating this message to the public, politicians and policymakers and reinforcing the message that investment in public health campaigns for smoking cessation is cost\-effective. An ITV report from 2018 included results from UTARG research, mentioning the additional 350,000 quit attempts \[S6\] while various online media outlets quoted the study team, including the *Daily Mail* and *GP online*: *“Lead author Dr Jamie Brown said: ‘The data clearly show ‘Stoptober’ resulted in a large increase in the number of people stopping smoking in England. The GBP5.8m spent on the campaign by the DH appears to have been an excellent investment.’”* **\[S6\]** *.* 

 **International commissioning decisions:** 

 **France:** The success of ‘Stoptober’ has led to it being adopted in France. A case study by Public Health France \(Santé publique France\) directly cited **\[R2\]** and reported “ *France decided to import the UK campaign ‘Stoptober’ because it was effective in increasing quit attempt rates.”* **\[S7\]**. Furthermore, an editorial by Executive Director of France’s National Institute for Prevention and Health Education \(INPES\) cites the UTARG evaluation \(google translate\): “ *The positive evaluation of the ‘Stoptober’ 2012 campaign led to the renewal of the campaign in 2013 and 2014… Inpes, in conjunction with the Alliance against Tobacco, is considering adapting this system to French territory*” **\[S8\]**. UTARG hosted a delegation from INPES to plan the French initiative and to ensure robust evaluation plans were in place, with one French delegate stating: “ *we often present it \(* **\[R2\]**\) *to our partners as a positive argument in favour of the French adaptation of ‘Stoptober’.”* The first iteration was launched in 2016, continuing to 2020, and has generated an estimated 380,000 quit attempts, according to an evaluation **\[S7\]**. 

 **Netherlands:** The evaluation of the original campaign in England was an influence in the launch of the Dutch ‘Stoptober’, in 2014, as indicated on the ‘Stoptober Nederlands’ launch website: “ *After the great success in England, the Netherlands also embraces 'Stoptober' this year”*. The influence of the underpinning research by UTARG can be seen in the public description of the campaign, which uses the same concept: “’ *Stoptober’ encourages every step you take towards a non\-smoking life through the free app that supports you personally. …Through social media you encourage each other to keep it going for 28 days.”*  Subsequent evaluations of ‘Stoptober’ show the influence of UTARG research in the campaign design and estimate that 50,000 people have participated each year, with evidence that *“an abstinence campaign with a wide reach in a national population may be effective in decreasing smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption among a broad range of participants”* **\[S9\]** *.* 

 **New Zealand:** A ‘Stoptober’ campaign was also launched and run in New Zealand between 2014 and 2016 by Smoke Free New Zealand, with clear links to the evidence behind the English version of the campaign; an online presentation by the organisation references both the study design by England’s Department of Health and Brown and West’s PRIME theory **\[S10\]**. Results from the end of the first year of the campaign estimated that *“5,200 smokers signed up to ‘Stoptober’ NZ 2014”* and that 55% of those successfully completed the programme with 82% being motivated by ‘Stoptober’ to stop smoking by *“a lot to a fair amount”* and 80% of participants confident in their ability to stop smoking **\[S10\]**.
