###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Durham University that enables better assessment of real\-world aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of road vehicles has been adopted for the development of new vehicles by manufacturers including Jaguar Land Rover \(JLR\), Nissan and GAC \(China\). This has resulted in vehicles with better aerodynamic performance, greater energy/fuel efficiency, better aeroacoustic performance \(leading to improved driver comfort and less risk of fatigue\) and associated positive economic impacts. 

 The three engineering centres making direct use of Durham’s work in this field include the UK’s two largest OEMs \(Original Equipment Manufacturers\) and are together responsible for engineering vehicles with a production of approximately 1.2M vehicles annually. Durham’s work in the field is cited by at least six other automotive OEMs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The aerodynamic and aeroacoustic development of vehicles is typically undertaken using steady\-state evaluation environments – both wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics \(CFD\) with steady inlet conditions and with a focus on zero\-yaw conditions \(no crosswind\). As a result, there are aspects of the on\-road environment that are not captured, including the effects of gusty on\-road conditions. These effects may be quasi\-steady or fully unsteady and affect the actual and perceived wind noise in the cabin, the handling of the vehicle and energy consumption. The challenge of vehicles in the real world not living up to expectations based on lab measurements and simulations is highlighted in each of \[E1\], \[E2\], \[E3\], \[E4\]. 

 Work at Durham over two decades has focused on unsteady aspects of vehicle aerodynamics and aeroacoustics including impacts of unsteady on\-road conditions. Work has included tests with novel wind tunnel capability at Durham \(e.g. \[R4\], \[R5\]\) and in external facilities \(e.g. \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\]\), on\-road measurements using instrumentation developed at Durham \(e.g. \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\]\) and CFD. The work has also included psychoacoustic evaluations to assess the importance of wind noise modulation on perceived noise levels \(e.g. \[R3\]\). 

 The work with the clearest impact to date has involved simultaneous on\-road measurements of onset flow, surface pressures and cabin noise making use of Durham’s instrumentation and data analysis techniques \(e.g. \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\]\). This has shown how the performance of a vehicle in this environment can be predicted based on wind tunnel measurements in a steady environment \(e.g. as in Figure 1\). The research showed that surveying the on\-road environment with an instrumented vehicle is important and provided a methodology for doing this. Earlier work on the topic had often assumed that that the on\-road environment could be assessed by stationary observations using Taylor’s hypothesis, but that approach fails to recognise the dominant significance, the spatial distribution of the on\-road natural wind, experienced by the moving vehicle as a temporal variation. Of particular significance is that the work successfully demonstrated the full path to predict accurately the real\-world performance. Further, combining on\-road measurements of onset flow, wind tunnel measurements of vehicle response and psychoacoustic evaluations has shown that the modulation of cabin noise by time\-varying onset conditions is an important factor \(eg: \[R3\]\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Research at Durham has developed measurement and analysis methodologies that are able to better assess the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of road vehicles in real\-world conditions. 

####  Impacts: 

 1\-These methodologies have been adopted by multiple automotive original equipment manufacturers \(OEMs\) in their processes for the development of new vehicles \(\[E1\], \[E2\], \[E3\], \[E4\], \[E5\], \[E6\]\). 

 2\-This in turn leads to vehicles that have better aerodynamic performance \(more fuel efficient under real\-world conditions, \[E2\], \[E4\], \[E6\], \[E8\]\) and better aeroacoustic performance \(more appealing to customers \[E1\], \[E2\], \[E5\], \[E6\]\), bringing economic benefits. There are also indications of improved safety \[E4\] including reduced driver fatigue \[E5\]. 

####  Background: 

 The automotive industry is a major contributor to the UK economy, with an annual turnover exceeding GBP78B and employing approximately 850,000 people \(Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Industry Facts 2020\). The two largest producers in the UK are Jaguar Land Rover \(JLR\) and Nissan, each producing approximately 350,000\-500,000 vehicles per year in the UK. 

 The reduction of vehicle cabin noise is desirable to customers and hence for manufacturers \[E1\], \[E2\], \[E5\], \[E6\] and highlighted by the JD Power customer satisfaction rankings, where wind noise is consistently one of the top 3 complaints across all vehicles \(e.g.: 2017 U.S. Initial Quality Study Key Stats\). 

 Transport is the largest energy consumer and producer of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK \(UK Energy in Brief 2019, BEIS\). Aerodynamic drag is a principal energy consumer for road vehicles, affecting fuel consumption, emissions and electric vehicle range \[E6\], \[E8\]. 

 As a result of not handling the implications of unsteady on\-road conditions it has, in the past, been possible to develop vehicles that perform well according to their development metrics/targets, but which do not meet expectations in practice \[E1\], \[E2\], \[E3\], \[E4\], \[E5\], \[E6\], \[E7\], \[E8\]. Durham’s research is used by industry to set smarter development metrics/targets, accounting for the on\-road environment, resulting in vehicles with better real\-world performance in terms of cabin noise and vehicle energy consumption. 

####  Impact via Jaguar Land Rover \(JLR\): 

 Prior to working with Durham, JLR had experienced an issue with a vehicle meeting its wind noise targets but experiencing gust modulation in windy conditions on\-road. A collaborative research project was undertaken with Durham to better understand wind effects and how to quantify them \(outputs including \[R1\], \[R2\], \[R3\]\). This resulted in a methodology that is now used within the company and the adoption of a new metric by the company for assessing real\-world aeroacoustic performance \[E5\]. New production parts were introduced to improve this aspect of the performance of the vehicle and sales of this model have subsequently grown ahead of its competitors to approximately GBP1B per annum \[E5\]. JLR recruited the PhD student involved in the work at Durham “ *in part to work towards integrating the results from his \(sic\) published work into the vehicle development process*.” \[E1\]. 

 From Technical Lead for Wind Noise, Jaguar Land Rover \[E1\]: 

 *“The techniques developed…at Durham have been integrated in a number of direct and indirect ways into the development process…the Durham\-based research has allowed for a more robust virtual sign off, reducing the number and severity of issues in the field.”* 

 *“Since the collaboration with Durham University began over a decade ago, wind noise issues have significantly reduced on Jaguar Land Rover vehicles, from being considered a systemic issue to that which results in a refined customer experience.”* 

####  Impact via Nissan: 

 Nissan Technical Centre Europe \(NTCE\), seeing \[R1\] and \[R2\] and recognising the relevance, initiated a programme to develop their methodology and approached Durham for assistance. They adopted instrumentation and methodologies from \[R1\] and \[R2\] for their ongoing work in the development of new vehicles, in particular for setting vehicle performance targets which ultimately determine the performance of the production vehicle. 

 A senior Nissan engineer comments \[E2\]: 

 *“It had been an ongoing difficulty for us to compare aeroacoustic results measured on‐road with each other and with wind tunnel measurements, due to the inconsistent airspeed and yaw angle in real world conditions.”* 

 *“We adopted instrumentation developed by Durham and have implemented their data analysis methodology in our own software. As a result, we were able to achieve a step‐change improvement in our ability to evaluate results on\-road.”* 

 “*Durham’s instrumentation and methodology now plays a key role in determining the aeroacoustic performance of the vehicles that we develop. This approach has been adopted for all Nissan vehicle programmes which are engineered and manufactured in Europe. This represents about 500,000 vehicles per year, exported to over 100 different countries. The largest share of these are manufactured at Nissan Motors UK.”* 

####  Impact via GAC & CAERI: 

 The China Automotive Engineering Research Institute \(CAERI\) provide automotive test facilities for OEMs, including test track facilities and greater thanUSD100M wind tunnel facility and have implemented methodologies developed at Durham for use by OEMs in China \[E3\], \[E7\]. 

 GAC Group is a Chinese OEM who develop \(engineer\) their own vehicles \(annual production 380,000 vehicles\) \[E4\]. They had observed discrepancies in on\-road performance, in particular with regard to electric vehicle range \[E4\] and they recognised the relevance of \[R1\] and \[R3\]. They have subsequently been using the methodologies introduced by Durham and working with CAERI to survey roads across China and have adopted a new metric for the assessment of aerodynamic drag accounting for on\-road wind effects. As for other OEMs, Durham’s work is being used to set smarter vehicle performance targets, resulting in better real\-world vehicle performance \[E9\]. 

 From CAERI \[E3\]: 

 *“Based on the published papers, such as SAE 2011\-01\-0159 and SAE 2014\-01\-0591, CAERI integrated the test system for road test, and has completed the road test….In the process, some OEMs joined the study and became our collaborators, such as GAC.”* 

 From GAC \[E4\]: 

 *“Since the beginning of our electric vehicle programs in 2016, we noticed discrepancies between the range we predicted from simulation models and the on\-road tests.”* 

 *“We came across papers published by the team lead by Professor Sims\-Williams…The work gave us inspirations for hardware instrumentation as well as data analysis methodology. We successfully instrumented the test vehicle and collected valuable on\-road test data in 2020.”* 

 *“Based on the results, we updated our aerodynamic drag criteria…The updated aerodynamic criteria apply to all vehicle development programs, impacting the fuel economy and safety of all of the vehicles we produce and sell every year.”* 

####  Further Impacts: 

 Beyond the impacts outlined above, Durham’s papers in the field have also been referenced by Engineers at Volvo, Toyota, Tesla, Souest \(Fujian\), BMW, Hyundai and Kia indicating that this work is also making some contribution to the development of methodologies employed in those OEMs. A list of the relevant references is provided in \[E9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Vassilis Monastiriotis' research on the adjustment of the Greek labour market to the Eurozone crisis led to his appointment to an Independent Experts Committee, convened by government to make a recommendation on minimum wage reform. Monastiriotis' published research and policy input on the impact of minimum wages in Greece played a key role in the recommendation by the Committee and directly informed the government’s decision \- against international policy advice at the time \- to raise the minimum wage by 10.9% in February 2019, benefitting an estimated 600,000 individuals \(approximately 30% of private sector employees\) and another 250,000 individuals whose out\-of\-work benefits are indexed on the minimum wage. As predicted by Dr Monastiriotis’ research, while improving individual outcomes for the low\-paid and reducing the risk of poverty, the reform had no adverse effects on the economy, as unemployment continued to fall uninterrupted and economy\-wide wage\-costs increased only marginally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 As the economic crisis in Greece unfolded between 2009 and 2016, Monastiriotis undertook an extensive programme of research on the adjustment of the Greek labour market to the crisis and to the subsequent policy reforms. Two of his papers \- **\[1\]** and **\[2\]**, in collaboration with Dr Rebekka Christopoulou, University of Macedonia, Greece \- were instrumental in showing how public and private sector wages adjusted during the crisis, indicating in particular a significant compression of wages at the bottom of the distribution. A third paper \- **\[3\]**, with Dr Angelo Martelli, LSE \- showed that unemployment adjustments were disproportionately concentrated on the low\-skilled \(employment sorting on the basis of education\). 

 Following his appointment to an Independent Experts Committee, convened by government to make a recommendation on minimum wage reform, Monastiriotis embarked upon new research \- **\[4\]**, in collaboration with Dr Andreas Georgiadis, Brunel University London \(lead researcher\) and Dr Ioannis Kaplanis, Athens University of Economics and Business \- on the impact of past minimum wage changes in Greece on wages and employment. He also carried out research \- **\[5\]**, in collaboration with Dr Ioannis Laliotis, LSE \- which fed directly into the work of the Committee, examining the distribution and characteristics of minimum wage earners and generating forecasts for the wage\-cost effects of a minimum wage increase under different scenarios. Specifically: 

-  The aim of **\[4\]** was to produce new, robust evidence on the impact of minimum wages on wages and employment, with which to inform policy – filling a very large gap of empirical evidence for Greece and connecting the findings from the international literature to the Greek case. Using a large sample of administrative social security records and state\-of\-the art econometric methods \(differential trend adjusted Diff\-in\-Diff\), it examined two episodes of minimum wage increases in 2009 and 2011 \(by 5.5% and 1.6% respectively\) as well as the very sizeable 2012 decrease \(by 22% for those aged 25 and above, and by 32% for the youth subminimum, introduced for under\-25s\). The key findings were as follows: 

1.  minimum wage rises led to wage increases for larger groups of workers \(i.e. not only those originally paid below the new level of the minimum wage\), but the size of such wage “spillovers” dissipated around the median of the wage distribution. 

1.  minimum wages do not have a systematic, significant effect on the employment opportunities of low\-wage workers, or on the number of jobs offered by low\-wage businesses. 

 In combination, these findings implied that a prospective minimum wage increase could raise the incomes of the low\-paid without significant effects on employment and with only limited wage\-cost spillovers to the rest of the wage distribution. 

-  **\[5\]** examined data from the Labour Force Survey to identify the characteristics of minimum\-wage earners \(e.g. married/single, age profile, education level, etc.\) and the sectors/occupations where they work. It also included a simulation analysis of the impact of prospective minimum wage increases under different policy scenarios, including that of a 10% increase in the minimum wage with full compliance in its implementation and concurrent abolition of the youth subminimum. The results indicated that such an increase would: 

  -  raise the wages of between 17.8% \(direct effect\) and 31.2% of all private sector employees \(depending on assumptions about the extent of wage spillovers: from zero to those found in **\[4\]**\). 

  -  contribute significantly to reducing wage inequalities among individuals \(including of the types observed in **\[1\]** and **\[2\]**\). 

  -  do so with minimal total\-economy cost implications \(estimated economy\-wide wage\-cost increase of between 1.82% and 3.10%, depending on different spillover scenarios\). It also identified the type of sectors and businesses that would be most affected by such an increase. 

 Overall, this body of work provided key insights on the state of the Greek labour market, offering a convincing conclusion that a carefully increased minimum wage could lead to increases in the wages of a large number of low\-wage workers and a reduction in wage inequality, with only negligible effects on the demand for labour and total\-economy wage costs. Monastiriotis’ input was leading in papers **\[3\]** and **\[5\]**, complementary in paper **\[4\]** \(leader: Georgiadis\), and of equal weight in papers **\[1\]** and **\[2\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 <ins> *Context*</ins> 

 In 2008 Greece suffered an economic crisis, precipitating an unprecedented recession and leading to the introduction of a structural adjustment programme agreed by the Greek Government and a “Troika” of institutions \(European Commission, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund\) in 2010. As part of the programme, in 2012 the Greek Government enforced a minimum wage reduction across all employees and introduced a lower subminimum for those under 25. The reduced minimum wage remained in force until completion of the structural adjustment programme in September 2018. 

 At this point, and given that the Greek economy had exhibited signs of recovery \(positive economic growth and declining unemployment\) since 2016, the Greek Government initiated a review of the minimum wage. This included the establishment of an Independent Experts Committee entrusted with the mandate of making a ""corroborated recommendation"" to the government on the level of the statutory minimum wage. Monastiriotis was appointed as member to this Committee by the then Minister of Labour, Social Security and Social Solidarity, Dr Efi Achtsioglou, on the basis of his expertise and academic research **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]** on the Greek labour market **\[A\] \[B\] \[C\]** and his contribution to public debates on the issue **\[D\]**. 

 <ins> *Links between research and impact*</ins> 

 Work by the Committee included both policy analysis and primary research. The latter, led by Monastiriotis **\[5\]**, provided detailed evidence on the potential economic impacts of a minimum wage increase under different scenarios and was ultimately included as Section 6 of the Committee Report **\[E\]**. The results were discussed extensively with government officials as well as members of the Troika **\[F\]** and played a key role in informing the subsequent policy decision on the minimum wage, as attested to by the Ministers of Labour **\[B\]** and Finance **\[C\]** and the Resident Representative of the European Commission in Greece **\[G\]**. Moreover, the results fed directly into the Committee Report **\[E\]**, guiding to a large extent its recommendation. 

 The independent research of Monastiriotis and his co\-authors **\[4\]** also directly influenced policy discussions. As was publicly acknowledged by the then Minister of Labour: “ *at a time when existing evidence was scarce, **\[4\]** provided the ministry with a clear direction on how much the minimum wage should be raised*” **\[H\] \[I\]**. Moreover, the evidence deriving from the underpinning research was critical in influencing the policy recommendations of the Experts Committee. Indeed, the Committee’s Final Report made direct reference to **\[4\]** in its justification of its reasoning concerning its recommendation to the government \(Section 7\) **\[E\]**. The Committee’s recommendations were further scrutinised by the Troika institutions. The evidence provided by **\[5\]** was an important point of discussion in support of these recommendations **\[F\]**. 

 Combined, these two outputs \( **\[4\]** and **\[5\]**\) proved crucial to the subsequent policy change, as they provided a robust evidence base which countered the prevailing international policy advice of the time, including that of the IMF **\[J\]**. Media analysis was no more optimistic, with the chief economics commentator at the *Financial Times* warning of the “threat” of “backsliding on policy” **\[K\]**. 

 <ins> *Impact*</ins> 

 Drawing on the aforementioned research links, the Committee’s recommendation concluded that an increase in the minimum wage by 10% would: 

1.  impact significantly on the incidence of low pay \(directly affecting the pay of an estimated 17.8% of all private sector employees and generating smaller pay increases for up to a further 13.4% of private sector employees\); but 

1.  have minimal adverse employment effects and broadly manageable effects on production costs \(raising the total wage\-bill in the economy by no more than 3.1%\) \(also outlined in Section 7 of the Report **\[E\]**\). 

 Acting on this recommendation, in January 2018 the Greek government decided to raise the statutory minimum wage by 10.9%, effective from 1 February 2019, and to abolish the youth subminimum \(a *de facto* overall increase of 27.2% for those younger than 25\) **\[L\]**. 

 The impact of this policy change on the economy and on individuals has been consistent with expectations outlined in the underpinning research. Estimates of the number of individuals whose pay has been directly influenced by the increase in the minimum wage are in the area of 600,000 **\[M\]**, while, additionally, the increase in the minimum wage is estimated to have benefitted between 200,000 and 300,000 individuals who are in receipt of social benefits \(unemployment, maternity, etc.\) which are indexed on the minimum wage **\[N\] \[O\] \[P\]**. According to the then Minister of Labour, “ *the policy contributed to reducing the risk of poverty for a very sizeable number of households in the country as well as to decreasing wage inequality*” **\[B\]**. 

 Concerning the overall impacts on the economy, the data from the Ministry of Labour on employment flows between January 2019 \(just before the minimum wage increase was enacted\) and February 2020 \(one year after the reform\), suggest that employment grew by 157,000 **\[Q\]**. Moreover, data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority show that, between January and December 2019, unemployment declined from 18.6% to 16.3% **\[R\]**; while between the last quarter of 2018 \(before the reform\) and the last quarter of 2019 \(latest data, year\-on\-year change\) the Wage\-costs Index rose by only 2.4% **\[S\]**; i.e. not too different from the rate predicted by Monastiriotis’ analysis in **\[5\]**. Importantly, the policy was maintained by the new government that came to power in 2019 **\[T\]**. More recently, the findings presented in **\[4\]** also featured in the latest report by the Group of Experts convened to consider options for reform of the French minimum wage \( **\[U\]**, pp. 113\-114\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Degen’s research on the organisation of sensory and temporal experiences has shaped strategies for the spatial design, curatorial practices and activity plans of the Interpretation Masterplan of the New Museum of London, the Cologne City Museum’s permanent collection and the London’s Charterhouse interiors and activities. In 2018, the Department of the Built Environment at the City of London Corporation used her research in their public realm redesign which subsequently improved the livelihoods of 10% of Greater London’s working population. In 2020, Dr Degen’s research supported Barcelona’s council plans to redesign Las Ramblas boulevard which is visited by approximately 1,000,000 people every year. Both planning departments have benefitted from being able to monitor the importance that experiences play in shaping the quality of life in cities and have incorporated these insights into their planning policies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In order to compete globally, city planners must create unique neighbourhoods for visitors and tourists. To create appealing destinations, much care goes into the planning, design, and branding of cities; a process of curation termed ‘placemaking’. Urban sociology has explored processes and the impacts they have on the wider environment and population. 

 Dr Degen’s research advances this work by demonstrating how the management and organization of urban experiences \- in her words, ‘urban aesthetics’ \(Ref. 4, 5\) \- is central to these processes. Her projects have analysed how sensory and temporal dynamics have become tools to frame different stages of urban development resources for place branding \(Ref. 2, 5, 6\) and contested terrains for users of public spaces that deeply frame their attachments to place \(Ref. 3, 4, 5\). These processes are increasingly digitally mediated, rearticulating people’s engagement with cities \(Ref.5, 6\). Dr Degen’s research findings demonstrate that urban experiences are political, socially shaped, and underpin power relations between the manifold actors in the city, whether architects, planners, residents or visitors. 

 Dr Degen’s research has demonstrated that sensory and temporal dynamics are integral to the production of the built environment. For example, Dr Degen’s ESRC funded research 'Architectural Atmospheres' \(Grant 3\), analysed how digital visualizations have changed the design process of cities and their future planning, showing that evoking sensory atmospheres is key to selling these future places. However, the digital depictions represented a limited range of future possibilities and a problematically narrow portrayal of social life \(Ref. 6\). 

 Her project: ‘Timescapes of Urban Change” \(Grant 1\) further demonstrated how urban regeneration processes are underpinned by temporal dynamics that stand in conflict with temporal patterns and perceptions of residents and visitors \(Ref. 3, 4\). The study confirmed the deep political nature of urban experiences, highlighting how some people and institutions exercise particular power over regulating and changing what is sensed and perceived in the city \(Ref. 2, 3\). 

 As sensory and temporal urban research remains in its infancy, a robust methodology to better research, represent and curate sensory\-experiential aspects of urban living is needed. Addressing this gap, Dr Degen established an EU\-wide AHRC research network ‘Sensory Cities’ \(Grant 2\), bringing together city museum curators, urban professionals and academics for practical workshops to design new methodological approaches. Methods to research qualitative sensory and emotional relations in the city \(e.g. sketching the senses, evocative interviews and social media analysis\) are summarised in an online Sensory Toolkit \(Ref 1\). 

 The spaces that urban professionals create are used by a wide variety of people \(residents, workers and visitors\) who each form different connections to the city. Dr Degen’s research demonstrates that sensory atmosphere, embodied perceptions of individuals, and temporal rhythms have significant impacts on how people relate and move through the city \(Ref. 2, 3\) and points to the need to include experiential and temporal considerations into understandings of community cohesion \(Ref. 3, 4\). Dr Degen’s focus on the experiential dynamics of the city \(senses, time, emotions\), was elaborated in 2017 through research in the Smithfields Market Area, London, the new home of the new Museum of London. To inform the new museum’s design and curatorial content, the study analysed the changing identity of the Smithfield area, drawing on new digital and experiential methodologies quantified for the museum in a series of evocative digital maps \(Ref. 1; Ref. 2\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Dr Degen’s research has shaped new ways of thinking and informed new approaches to curatorial and design practices of museum curators and urban planners in 3 countries across Europe \(England, Germany, Spain\), which benefit approximately 1,400,000 people per year. 

 **1. Informing the City of London’s approach to public realm improvements, and Barcelona’s remodelling strategies for Las Ramblas** 

 Dr Degen’s research on the experiential and sensorial nature of urban life and qualitative digital mapping techniques and sensory toolkit “provides new ways to examine and understand urban dynamics” \(E1\) which is shaping London’s and Barcelona’s most iconic public spaces. 

 By highlighting the importance of urban atmospheres to the daily experiences of City workers \(10% of London’s working population, equivalent to 500,000 pedestrians\) and residents, as well as the power of professional bodies to influence and regulate the sensory urban environment, the research shaped “the strategic long\-term vision document for the East of the City: The City Cluster Vision” \(E2\). It “influenced the development of public consultation methodologies…aimed at understanding the needs and aspirations of the City’s occupiers and visitors” \(E2\). This new strategy from 2019 incorporates new insights about the importance of sensory experiences in shaping people’s engagement, with places, with sensory interactions now integrated into the redevelopment of the City’s public realm. In particular, Dr Degen’s sensory urbanism research has changed the City’s public realm team’s approach to 2 key areas of the Cluster Vision: 1\) the impact of public realm improvements “to target specific issues around well\-being, inclusivity and experience of local places…for examples, we have developed a project focusing on climate change and well\-being … \[consisting\] of green interventions…to improve the livelihoods of the nearly 300,000 daily users of the City.” 2\) the inclusion of “culture and local place engagements within place activation activities as a core element of our strategy…to change perceptions” \(E2\). As a manager in the Department of the Built Environment stated, “We have used her work to enhance our working practices, urban analysis and consultation practices…” \(E2\). 

 Barcelona’s Foment de Ciutat – a municipal company of Barcelona City Council – have used Dr Degen’s research to incorporate temporal and sensorial perceptions in urban development projects and improve community cohesion. As the Director states: “Degen’s \[research\] has given us the tools to change our strategies in the last decade and motivating us to focus very much on the qualities of urban experiences… \[this\] has supported a change in the strategy and philosophy of Foment…as a result…qualitative research and participatory approaches are fully incorporated in our design process” \(E6\). Foment recently launched a public tender to remodel the famous Ramblas boulevard which is visited by approximately 1,000,000 people per year and has been struggling to accommodate ever rising numbers of tourists alongside resident users of this space. 

 Liquen Data Lab, a research consultancy group, designed a proposal that used Dr Degen’s research as “a theoretical and practical framework” \(E1\) to evaluate and monitor the new urban strategies for the Ramblas. The director of this winning proposal stated: “because of \[Dr Degen’s\] work, we can now capture feelings and perceptions of urban space, which is essential to design inclusive and democratic cities”. This has allowed the team to “scale up our research and design the Qualitative Observatory of Las Ramblas with the main goal to incorporate qualitative and sensory standpoint knowledge of this complex main street…and contribute to the transformation of the dynamics of Las Ramblas and benefit residents and tourists alike.” \(E1\). The execution has been halted due to Covid\-19 and is planned for 2022. 

 **2. Influencing new approaches to designing city museum spaces and curating collections** 

 Through improving museum curators’ understandings of the significance of the senses in a\) shaping urban development and stratifying social relations in the city and b\) how audiences experience space and interact with exhibitions, this research has directly led to museums incorporating sensory experiences in their curatorial practices and strategies for the design of new museum buildings at: Museum of London \(E4\), Charterhouse Museum London \(E3\), Cologne City Museum \(E5\). Through these changes, curators have been able to use sensory activities “to reduce barriers in participation” within community engagement \(E3\), reach broader audiences, and make visible underrepresented themes around love and hate \(E5\). Furthermore, the Centro de Cultura Contemporània Barcelona states that Dr Degen’s work “has offered qualitative tools to assess the prestigious EU Prize for Urban Space by…adding a cultural and social dimension to the judgement criteria” \(E7\). 

 The workshops and toolkit produced by the Sensory Cities project \(Grant 2\) have been used to influence the strategies and financial plans for the redesign of the Charterhouse Museum London interiors and development of their public engagement programme featuring “sensory awareness.” This enabled them to win Heritage Lottery Funding \(GBP391,000\) in 2018. The research was used to shape the approaches to the redesign of Charterhouse’s new museum and “the new space was designed with a specific sensory awareness that included leading visitors through time with use of different textured and aged floor tiles such as modern floor\-tiles to ancient flag stones” \(E3\). The museum’s new public engagement programme includes a multi\-sensory programme for children with special needs and “puts sensory activities to the fore as a way of reducing barriers to participation to access hard to reach groups. The sensory toolkit was used to devise sensory and participatory events and activities such as weaving, drawing, and creative activities, which are increasingly seen as a key tool for museum professionals…, leading to more visitors \(from the current 27,500 visitors a year \- in 2017\-8; to 40,000 a year\), and more emphasis on participation and visitors developing their own ways of enjoying the site’s heritage” \(E3\). 

 The Museum of London \(MoL\) is moving to a new site in 2024 which includes the renovation and redesign of large parts of Smithfield meat market and surrounding streets. Dr Degen’s research on Smithfield and “her expertise in the sensory city resulted in the incorporation of such experiences in parts of the Interpretation Masterplan” \(one of the key documents for the delivery of the new museum requiring an investment of GBP337,000,000\). It directly references Dr Degen’s research findings: “With its relocation to the West Smithfield site, the Museum of London now has a unique opportunity to connect to the surrounding streets and people and make its history visible and tangible by explicitly focusing on its existing sensory landscape” \(E4\). The sensory understandings in the Interpretation Masterplan have directly “led the museum developing ideas about the experience and usage of its main entrance…the museum has decided to retain West Poultry Avenue as a distinctive street, …retaining its sensory characteristics” \(E4\). Overall, Dr Degen’s research “resulted in the much\-needed incorporation of sensory dynamics in the design of the new museum” \(E4\). 

 The head of the New MoL stated that the participation of his staff in Dr Degen’s Sensory Cities and Sensory Smithfield workshops has further contributed to the strategic goal of ‘Stretch Thinking’ by encouraging them to test “new models of curation to capture underrepresented aspects of contemporary London and to enable visitors to think about city life in new ways” \(E4\). Dr Degen’s research “influenced our approach and expanded our perception especially of the 24\-hour life and rhythms of this locality”. It “has taught us new ways to capture the complexity and vibrancy of the museum’s new site…” \(E4\). Since the workshops, curators have used more interactive curatorial practices to engage visitors by “conveying the sensory experience of London in the past and providing a good sensory experience in the museum itself” \(E4\). 

 In 2017, the Cologne City Museum \(approximately 70,000 visitors per year\) had to relocate temporarily to new premises following water damage. While this threatened their survival “insights from Degen’s project and the Sensory Toolkit inspired and guided us to experiment with new curatorial practices and exhibition designs…centred around themes of senses and emotions, such as love, fear and hope. Because of this we could include aspects of Cologne’s history, which previously hadn’t been represented” \(E5\). The museum was seriously concerned about the loss of visitors following the damage, however, “Sensory Cities has provided us with new skills and tools to engage a wider audience, and therefore enabled us to create new experiences and avoid that scenario” with special exhibition visitors increasing by 30%. The new understandings and practices learnt from Dr Degen’s research have improved engagement with a wider audience through “the development of more innovative tours that go beyond traditional museum tours… For example, we now offer tours…that ensure visitors physical wellbeing…This has allowed us to increase our visitor profile, improve visitors’ experiences and attract new groups of guests.” \(E5\)

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Effective regulation and technological assessment of new medicines are key to ensuring that drugs are safe and effective for patients, and cost\-effective for health systems. Research from King’s College London has shown how regulatory developments in the US and EU have allowed new drugs to enter the market on the basis of less robust clinical evidence, which in turn may undermine appropriate clinical decision\-making, patient safety and the ability of policy makers to determine the value of new therapeutics for health systems and population health. 

 This research has \(i\) influenced World Health Organization \(WHO\) policy on new cancer drugs, including criteria for the inclusion of these drugs in its Essential Medicines List; \(ii\) strengthened the capacity of civil society organisations to scrutinise and advocate for enhanced medicines policy within the EU and internationally; and \(iii\) informed and empowered patient activists in the UK. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Paradoxically, during a period in which decision\-makers have expressed a commitment to evidence\-based medicine and policy, a dominant trend in the United States and the European Union over the past 30 years has been to lower evidence standards for, and ‘fast\-track’ an increasing number of new therapies onto the market despite significant uncertainty around their benefits and risks. For example, in 2018, 48 of 59 \(81%\) new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) benefited from some kind of regulatory pathway allowing for expedited testing or regulatory review. In both the US and EU, these special regulatory programmes most commonly benefit high\-cost cancer drugs. 

 Proponents claim these initiatives incentivise medical innovation and speed patient access to promising therapies, and that critical data on drug efficacy and safety \(which would normally be required before drugs enter the market\) can be generated in the post\-market period while drugs are being prescribed to patients. However, health policymakers, clinicians and patients depend on the availability of reliable evidence to determine whether the benefits of new and more costly medicines will outweigh their harms and offer meaningful improvements over older, cheaper drugs. 

 An on\-going programme of research by Dr Courtney Davis – supported by competitively\-awarded grants from the Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\), the Wellcome Trust, and the European Commission’s Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency \(CHAFEA\) – explores the drivers and implications of these trends. 

 **Investigating new paradigms in US and EU medicines policy** 

 Between 2001 and 2012 Davis and colleagues undertook the first EU\-US comparative analysis of the drivers, implementation and impacts of new ‘fast track’ policies for regulating innovative pharmaceuticals \[1\]. Through in\-depth, case study analyses of regulatory decision\-making in those regions over a twenty\-year period, King’s research showed the new policies did not necessarily lead to the prioritisation, incentivisation or approval of therapeutically important medicines. On the contrary, in each case examined, regulators had approved onto the market drugs of marginal or highly uncertain benefit. Some of those drugs posed unacceptable risks to patients and were subsequently withdrawn. Drawing on these findings, Davis’s 2016 *BMJ* paper \[2\] considered the implications and potential dangers of proposals by the European Medicines Agency \(EMA\) to further loosen regulatory standards by expanding the pathways through which companies could market new drugs on the basis of immature evidence. The paper noted that the proposals had been subject to minimal scrutiny and called for a more public and inclusive debate. 

 **Exploring the implications of current regulatory policy for cancer care** 

 Davis’s most recent research has focused on the regulation of new cancer drugs, which now comprise the single largest category of new drug approvals in Europe and the US. Davis’s research shows that although uptake of new cancer medicines is often accompanied by steep prices, and high expectations, evidence at their point of approval rarely supports claims to ‘breakthrough’ status \[3,4,5\]. For example, a retrospective cohort analysis by King’s researchers of all cancer drugs approved by the EMA between 2009 and 2013 \[3\] showed that the majority lacked evidence that they extend patients’ survival or improve quality of life. Where survival or quality of life gains *were* demonstrated, they were marginal according to established thresholds. Critically, King’s research \[6\] also showed that adequate evidence to address knowledge deficits is rarely demanded by FDA or EMA in the post\-market period, undermining claims that clinical uncertainty at time of market approval will be resolved through evidence generation once drugs are being prescribed to patients. The research recommended that regulators raise standards of drug approval by requiring that new drugs demonstrate clinically meaningful gains in survival and quality of life at the time of their approval. 

 King’s researchers also undertook the first systematic analysis of the health and budgetary impacts of the UK’s NHS Cancer Drugs Fund \(CDF\) – a ring\-fenced fund set up to enable patients to access high\-cost cancer therapies \[4\]. The research highlighted the problems of setting a low threshold for reimbursement by demonstrating the limited clinical benefits associated with these drugs and concluded that the CDF had failed to provide meaningful benefit to patients or society, recommending the avoidance of similar ‘ring\-fenced’ drug access funds in other countries. Critically, the research suggested that the GBP968,000,000 spent on the CDF resulted in overall net harm to population health since it displaced other, more cost\-effective treatments. Moreover, unrealistic expectations in relation to the clinical benefits offered by new drugs may actually harm individual patients if these expectations result in aggressive and inappropriate treatment with toxic chemotherapies towards the end of life \[5\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 As spending on expensive new medicines increasingly displaces other treatments, and policies modelled on the ‘fast\-track’ initiatives of the FDA and the EMA are adopted by drug regulatory agencies across the globe, careful evaluation of these initiatives, and transparent, inclusive debate has become ever more important. Through engagement with, and dissemination to regulators, international governmental bodies, clinicians, politicians and civil society groups at national and supranational levels, research led by Davis has influenced policy and practice in a variety of ways. 

 **Influencing World Health Organization \(WHO\) policy on new cancer drugs** 

 According to expert advisors sitting on the WHO’s Essential Medicines Committee for Cancer, Davis’s research \[3,4\] *“has been pivotal in drawing attention to the often marginal and uncertain benefits offered by many new cancer drugs relative to their price”* \[A\] and has shaped WHO policy with respect to eligibility criteria for cancer medicines proposed for the WHO’s Essential Medicines List, and WHO policy and recommendations around affordability and access to cancer medicines. 

 In March 2018, the WHO convened the Essential Medicines List Cancer Medicines Working Group \(EML\-CMWG\) to advise on criteria for the selection of cancer drugs for WHO’s Essential Medicines List, a list of the most efficacious, safe and cost\-effective medicines for priority conditions. Drawing on King’s research, which challenges the increasing tendency of regulators to approve new cancer drugs without evidence of clinically relevant impacts on patient survival or quality of life \[3; B p.7\-8\], the EML\-CMWG advised on “the need to have overall survival as the main eligibility criterion of a medicine proposed for EML listing” \[B p.4\]. This recommendation was subsequently endorsed by the WHO Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines \[C p.xvi\]. As noted by members of the WHO Essential Medicines Committee for Cancer; “Dr Davis’ seminal publications in this area provided crucial underpinning policy research that shaped the recommendations and conclusions of the working groups & subsequent WHO policy around inclusion \(and exclusion\) criteria for inclusion of cancer medicines on the Essential Medicines List” \[A\]. In 2019 the EML was updated, adding 12 cancer medicines, purposefully selected due to their designation as ‘best in terms of survival rates’. As noted by the WHO Director\-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus “around the world, more than 150 countries use WHO’s Essential Medicines List to guide decisions about which medicines represent the best value for money, based on evidence and health impact. The inclusion in this list of some of the newest and most advanced cancer drugs is a strong statement that everyone deserves access to these life\-saving medicines, not just those who can afford them” \[D\]. 

 Davis’s research \[3,4\] also informed WHO recommendations related to the pricing and reimbursement of new cancer drugs. In 2017, the World Health Assembly requested guidance from WHO on options to enhance the affordability and accessibility of new cancer medicines. In response, the WHO convened an expert advisory group to report on the pricing of cancer medicines and its impacts. The resulting report drew extensively on King’s research \[E, p.11, 20, 35, 67, 106\], including the finding that the UK Cancer Drugs Fund “failed to deliver meaningful value to patients and society” \[E, p.67\]. As a result, the recommendations resulting from the report advised that countries should *“\[a\]void the use or establishment of funds earmarked for the provision of cancer medicines”* \[E, p.106\]. 

 **Building capacity of civil society organisations to scrutinise and advocate for enhanced medicines policy within the EU and internationally** 

 Through collaboration and engagement with advocacy groups and consumer health organisations, Davis’s research \[1,2,3\] has also facilitated a more transparent and inclusive discussion on medicines policy internationally. Her research, and subsequent dissemination activities, have strengthened the capacity of such groups to engage in high\-level discussions with policymaking and regulatory bodies, improving effective scrutiny and better enabling them to pursue favourable outcomes. \[text removed for publication\] 

 The International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities \(ICDRA\) provides drug regulatory authorities of WHO Member States with a forum to meet and discuss ways to strengthen collaboration. The ICDRAs have been instrumental in guiding regulatory authorities, WHO and interested stakeholders, and in determining priorities for action in national and international regulation of medicines. In 2016 an international coalition of patient groups and NGOs \(including AIDS Treatment Action Campaign South Africa; the Global TB Community Advisory Board International; SECTION27 South Africa; Health Gap International; and Treatment Action Group US/International\) drew on Davis’s BMJ analysis piece \[2\] to petition national medicines agencies and governments attending the ICDRA to stop lowering regulatory standards \[G\]. With Davis’s research, the coalition of five patient groups and NGOs concerned with the regulation of medicines in the public interest, both in their various countries and globally were able to create more succinct arguments based on evidence. In particular their petition directly referenced Davis’s research and stated that “the lowering of regulatory standards must be stopped… the public interest requires that medicines must be proven to be safe, effective and of high quality before allowed onto the market” \[G\]. 

 Similarly, key European consumer health organisations, including BEUC \(the European umbrella organisation for Consumer Associations\), EPHA \(the European Public Health Alliance\), the Medicines in Europe Forum, Test Achats \(the Belgian Consumers’ Association\), and Health Action International Europe have drawn on Davis’s research to develop evidence\-based policy recommendations and advocate for stronger medicines regulation in their interactions with the public health community, the European Medicines Agency, the European Commission and politicians at European and member state level. 

 For example, at a national level, the NGOs Test Achats, Stand Up for Cancer, and Doctors of the World used findings from Davis’s research \[3\] to develop their knowledge and understanding of the marginal or uncertain benefits offered by some new anti\-cancer drugs \[H1\]. As a result, the group developed ten key recommendations on the accessibility and affordability of medical treatments at a symposium with members of the Belgian House of Representatives on 8 November 2018 \[H2\]. Recommendation 3 cited Davis’s research \[3\] to argue that price should be proportionate to the health gains offered by new therapies \[H3, p.29\]. This recommendation was supported by the majority of Belgian political parties \[H2\]. 

 At the level of the supranational EU: “the evidence provided by Dr Davis and her colleagues has helped civil society groups like BEUC make a stronger case for the need to reinforce the EU medicines approval system, and to engage with the EMA and EU policymakers with a more authoritative voice. BEUC’s advocacy efforts in the last years have resulted in increased awareness among EU policymakers about the need to continue strengthening the regulatory framework, so it can provide more value to patients and consumers” \[I\].

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Bird’s engagement with the art of Leon Golub represents a sustained research project, initiated in the 1980s and continuing to the present day. Its origins lie in Golub’s response to an article that Bird published in the journal *Block* \(Middlesex University,1979\-89\), and the theoretical and methodological approach to visual culture pioneered by the journal. Bird’s research examines Golub’s ‘critical realism,’ his complex relation with Modernism, his approach to the politics of pictorial representation, and his explorations of the male body as signifier of masculinity, subject to the operations of state power and violence. These issues were initially explored in the critical monograph *Leon Golub: Echoes of the Real* \(Reaktion Books, 2000\) **\[3.1\]**; and in a *Retrospective* exhibition that Bird curated for the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin \(July\-October 2000\), which toured to the South London Art Gallery \(November\-December 2000\), the Albright\-Knox Gallery, Buffalo, New York \(January\-April 2001\) and the Brooklyn Museum, New York \(May\-August 2001\). 

 Subsequently, Bird curated a major Golub retrospective for the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte, Reina Sofia, Madrid \(May\-September 2011\), the first time this artist’s work had been exhibited in Spain **\[3.2\]**. Including many works not previously exhibited, Bird’s curatorial discourse analysed the major themes of Golub’s work – sexuality, masculinity, mythology, hybridity and mortality – and the stylistic transformations of his practice: from early classically influenced works, through the Vietnam paintings, the works of the 1980s, the introduction of dogs, lions and text in the 1990s, and the small paintings and drawings of the early 2000s, Golub’s ‘late style.’ The exhibition was accompanied by a catalogue edited by Bird, which included his and others critical essays on the artist **\[3.2\]**. In addition, Bird revised and added two new chapters to *Leon Golub: Echoes of the Real* \(Reaktion Books, 2011\) **\[3.1\]**, which focused on the artist’s use of photographic imagery as source material for his paintings and Golub’s ‘late style,’ and the significance of drawing to his practice. In the exhibition and publications, Bird presents Golub as a contemporary history painter whose large\-scale depictions of war, torture and the impact of oppressive political and military regimes upon individual and social bodies continues to resonate in the present. 

 An ongoing aspect of Bird’s research has been to situate Golub in the narratives of post\-War American art as a painter of scenes of social relevance and historical witness, which express something quintessential about American power and masculinity in the twentieth century.  Bird had a long\-term working relationship with Golub, which he drew on for his contribution to the exhibition *Leon Golub: Bite Your Tongue* at London’s Serpentine Gallery \(2015\). For this Bird loaned works from his own collection, acted as a consultant, and wrote an essay for the catalogue, ‘A New York Story,’ which traced the background to Bird’s relationship with the artist, and describes the artist’s studio working environment, his close relationship to his wife, the artist Nancy Spero, and the beginnings of Bird’s involvement in her art. Background research for the essay came from personal diaries and the ongoing recorded interviews Bird conducted with Golub over a twenty year period **\[3.3\]**. As key artists in the formation of the post\-War Chicago ‘Monster Roster’ group, Golub and Spero were two of the fourteen artists included in the award\-winning exhibition *Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago* at the Smart Museum \(2016\), the first exhibition in America to explore the artists in this important group, and their place in the history of postwar American Art. Bird contributed an essay to the catalogue, ‘Myth and Transformation in the Art of Leon Golub’ **\[3.4\]**, examining Golub’s influence on the ‘Monster Roster’ artists through his figuring of the ‘tragic hero’ and explorations of mythic archetypes. Identifying early formal and technical processes underlying an ‘expressionist figuration,’ Bird argues that the artist’s early compositions of the 1950s\-1960s partly derived from his interest in archaic mythology and direct experience of the classical world which, along with his art historical knowledge, were directed towards ‘the imaging of a postwar, American subject.’ 

 In 2016, Bird curated the exhibition *Leon Golub Powerplay: The Political Portraits* **\[3.5\]**, at London’s National Portrait Gallery \(NPG\). Facial expression became increasingly important for Golub’s form of expressive realism, first explored by Bird in the chapter ‘Portraits of Power’ in his book *Leon Golub; Echoes of the Real*; and in 2011 in a room devoted to these portraits in the Reina Sofia retrospective. For the NPG display, Bird curated a selection of portraits to demonstrate Golub’s attention to the mediated ‘look of power,’ a key element in the artist’s pictorial language. The political portraits represent the artist’s sustained period of exploration of the media’s presentation of powerful leaders and came at a time when the Nixon administration introduced the televisual image of ‘presidency.’ This thematic focus also allowed Golub to challenge the traditional conventions of portraiture, and to work in series – the visualisation of power and its effects upon visage over time. The exhibition was accompanied by a book, *Leon Golub Powerplay: The Political Portraits* **\[3.6\]**, which is the most complete visual compilation of the series to date. In parallel, he was also invited to select works for an exhibition at Golub’s London Gallery, Hauser & Wirth \(19 March – 3 April 2016\), which provided context for an enhanced understanding of the portraits exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Through collaboration with the museum and gallery sector, Bird’s research has extended awareness and appreciation of Leon Golub’s work to a global audience, and enhanced understanding of Golub as an artist whose politically charged artistic discourse continues to be relevant. Indicators of reach and significance are given by the high profile of the museums and galleries Bird has worked with, audience figures, and critical reception and media coverage. In addition, Bird’s expertise developed via his overall body of research were utilised to provide evidence and expert testimonial in an American civil art fraud case, related to paintings from Andrew Hall’s private collection, one of the largest private holdings of modern and contemporary art. First suspected to be of doubtful provenance by Bird upon seeing images of works to be included in a proposed exhibition, the Hall Foundation asked Bird to make a detailed examination of the paintings. He concluded the works were ‘not by the hand of the artist,’ resulting in the jury finding in favour of Hall. 

 **\(1\) Extending awareness and appreciation of Golub’s work to a global audience, through contribution to high profile ‘retrospective’ exhibitions.** In recognition of his role as the leading scholar on Golub, Bird was invited as a consultant for the exhibition *Leon Golub: Bite Your Tongue*, curated by Emma Enderby at the Serpentine Gallery, London \(March – May 2015\). The exhibition aimed to ‘highlight key aspects of \[Golub’s\] career by bringing selected themes into focus through chronological groupings of works’ **\[5.1a\]**. In the ‘Introduction’ to the exhibition catalogue, the Serpentine’s Co\-Directors of Exhibitions and Programmes, Julia Peyton\-Jones and Hans Ulrich Obrist, recognised Bird’s ‘expert research and advice’ in the preparation of the exhibition **\[5.1b\]**, for which Bird also lent two drawings from his personal collection, ‘Mr Amok’ and ‘Proud.’ These illustrate Golub’s ‘late style,’ which Bird discussed in Leon Golub: *Echoes of the Real* **\[3.1\]** and represented in the Reina Sofia exhibition **\[3.2\]**. The exhibition was met with an ‘overwhelming response from the public’, with over 1,100 visitors daily and 76,726 visitors in total **\[5.1a\]**, and extremely positive reviews in the press **\[5.2\]**. Adrian Searle noted in The Guardian: ‘This is a terrific exhibition. The paintings roar off the walls’ **\[5.2\]**. A further indicator of the significance of Bird’s contribution is given by his organisation and chairing of a one\-day symposium on Golub at the Royal College of Art to coincide with the exhibition. Speakers included Adam Curtis, Avery Gordon, Oscar Murillo, John Roberts and Martha Rosler **\[5.1c\]**. The exhibition also travelled to Museo Tamayo, Mexico City \(September 2015 – February 2016\). 

 In 2016, Bird entered into discussion with The Metropolitan Museum, New York \(The Met\), about gifting works from his Golub collection and an exhibition of such works, supplemented by loans from other public and private collections. The result was the exhibition *Leon Golub: Raw Nerve*, staged in the galleries of The Met’s temporary space, The Met Breuer \(February – May 2018\). As consultant curator, Bird worked closely with The Met’s Chief Curator, Kelly Baum, and her curatorial team, advising on the location and selection of works. *Raw Nerve* was constructed around works from Bird’s personal collection **\[5.3a\]** and the gifting of a major painting, ‘Gigantomachy II’ \(1966\) from the Spero/Golub Foundation, to The Met’s collection of contemporary art. The work demonstrates Golub’s transition from his ‘classicism’ of the 1950s and early 1960s to his ‘Vietnam’ period, aspects of Golub’s practice which Bird discussed in both *Echoes of the Real* **\[3.1\]** and ‘Myth and Transformation in the art of Leon Golub’ **\[3.4\]**. As one of the six Trustees of the Foundation, Bird was instrumental in the gifting of this wall\-sized painting, which was the first work to confront, and often stun, visitors **\[5.3a\]**. Many of the paintings, drawings and prints in the exhibition had never before been publicly displayed, and the inclusion of the lesser\-known drawings and prints offered an understanding of the range and diversity of Golub’s practice. *Raw Nerve* was very popular among visitors and one of The Met’s ‘highlights in fiscal year 2018’ among the fifty\-seven exhibitions it mounted **\[5.3b\]**. It received extensive, positive critical reviews, including The Brooklyn Rail, the Wall Street Journal, and The New York Review of Books **\[5.4\]**. Karen Wilkin described *Raw Nerve* for The Wall Street Journal as ‘unforgettable and difficult to come to terms with’ **\[5.4\]**. Bird’s *Leon Golub:* *Echoes of the Real* was available in the bookshop and Clayton Press observed for the Forbes: ‘Bird’s book \(…\) is particularly notable since its cover has a partial reproduction of Golub’s breathtaking painting, “All Bets Are Off” \(1995\). This work, in combination with “Bite Your Tongue” \(2001\), close the exhibition. Both paintings address “apocalyptic dystopia: the end of civilization as we know it”’ **\[5.4\]**. 

 For the *Leon Golub Retrospective* at the Fondazione Prada, Milan curated by Germano Celant \(October 2017 – January 2018\) – the first large\-scale survey in Italy of the artist’s work \- Bird loaned a work from his collection, ‘Napalm Shield 1’ \(1970\); and contributed an essay for the publication, which provided the context for an element that diverged from previous Golub exhibitions. One large gallery was given to a display of the artist’s ‘Installations’ that he produced in the 1990s: images printed upon individual Duraclear transparent filmic plastic sheets, suspended throughout the space, allowing viewers to wander amongst them and encounter changing juxtapositions and connections. These works were the subject of Bird’s essay ‘Between the Window and the Screen: Leon Golub’s Transparencies,’ published in the exhibition’s catalogue \(pp. 41\-48\) **\[5.5\]**. The essay built upon research that Bird published in the second edition of *Echoes of the Real* **\[3.1\]**, which examined Golub’s use of photographic imagery and his photo archive. It traced the evolution of Golub’s combination of images taken from his paintings and archive of photographic references, screen\-printed onto Duraclear transparent filmic sheets of plastic, which were displayed in the 1990s in eight museum locations in America and Europe. 

 **\(2\) Enhancing knowledge of Golub’s significance as a history painter addressing issues of power, identity and the body relevant to the present.** In 2013, Bird entered into discussions with London’s National Portrait Gallery \(NPG\) about a display of Golub’s ‘political portraits’ – over one\-hundred portraits of political, military, corporate and religious leaders, which the artist produced between 1976\-1979. This was the first time these works were seen in the UK, a small selection being displayed in one of the public spaces of the Gallery, where they could be viewed in relation to the permanent collection and receive the maximum footfall, which was estimated to be in excess of one million visitors over the duration of the exhibition **\[5.6a\]**. *Leon Golub Powerplay: The Political Portraits* **\[3.5\]** was spread across the regular non\-ticketed location of the *Intervention* series, a main wall of Level 2. Dr Nicholas Cullinan, Director of the NPG, praised the exhibition as ‘an important addition to the gallery’s *Intervention* series focusing on themes of representation in twentieth century portraiture’ **\[5.6b\]**. As curator, Bird selected eighteen portraits of thirteen ‘men of power,’ which were arranged in a salon hang around the focal point of Golub’s single image of a religious leader, ‘Pope Paul IV.’ At Bird’s suggestion, the framing wall was re\-painted in Golub’s familiar red oxide, the ground for his 1980s depictions of ‘Mercenaries’ and ‘Interrogations’, the colour also used previously for the portrait room in the Reina Sofia retrospective **\[3.2\]**. Of the eighteen portraits on view, ‘Franco’, ‘Castro’ and ‘Kissinger’ were examples from extended series of those individuals. Local interest was represented in the portrait of ‘Michael Foot’ \(1976\), which, like others, had never been previously exhibited. Bird wrote the introductory wall texts and an accompanying leaflet, which provided contextual information on the subject of each portrait; he also gave a number of talks on the work in the gallery to general and invited audiences. The exhibition opened in March 2016 for a six\-month period and received positive press coverage **\[5.7\]**. Oliver Basciano’s ‘Anatomy of an artwork: Francisco Franco portrait,’ published in The Guardian, reached 166,039 readers **\[5.7\]**; it analysed the portrait, identifying Franco’s cruelty and machismo in the face of an old man approaching death. These traces of power in facial gestures were examined in the exhibition’s accompanying book, *Leon Golub Powerplay: The Political Portraits* **\[3.6\]** \(available in the NPG bookshop for the duration\), which also served as a catalogue for the display, as it included visual documentation of the entire portrait series. The portraits were critically examined and contextualised in two essays \(Bird and Perry\). Bird also selected sixteen paintings and eight drawings from Hauser & Wirth’s extensive holdings of the artist’s work, which were exhibited in a ‘salon’ hang in the Saville Row gallery. This display provided viewers with a range of the artist’s subjects and themes, further contextualising the focused display at the NPG. From the intimacy of his late drawings \(2000\-2004\), to the history paintings of the 1970s\-1990s, the exhibition presented Golub’s depictions of the male body as both instigator and victim of violence, from the Classical period to the present day. 

 **\(3\) Impact on the commercial art world via the provision of evidence and expert testimonial in a civil art fraud case in America.** In early 2015, the Golub/Spero Foundation – of which Bird is one of the six Trustees – was approached by the Hall Art Foundation regarding their intention to mount an exhibition of Golub’s paintings from the private collection of Andrew Hall. Founded in 2007, the Hall Foundation has galleries and exhibition spaces in Vermont, runs the Schloss Derneburg Museum, Hanover, Germany, and is in partnership with the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. With one of the largest private holdings of modern and contemporary art, Andrew Hall has a large collection of Golub works, many of which have been loaned to exhibitions of the artist including the Reina Sofia retrospective and the NPG. When the Hall Foundation provided images of all the paintings in their proposed exhibition, Bird realised that a significant number were of doubtful provenance. This began an investigative process which culminated in a court case over the suspect works at the United States District Court, Concord, New Hampshire \(2018\). The case became a significant example of contemporary art forgery and received extensive coverage in the American press and international art journals including the New York Times **\[5.9\]**, which details Bird’s contribution to proceedings. At the outset, Bird was identified by the Hall Foundation as ‘the world authority on the art of Leon Golub’ **\[5.10\]** and was contracted to examine the suspect paintings. Key to the proceedings was Bird’s deep knowledge \- developed via his overall body of research \- of Golub’s ‘signature style’: the artist’s technique in applying acrylic paints and lacquer; understanding of human anatomy in representing bodies under duress; and attention to clothing, weaponry and gesture. Over a two\-day period in September 2017, Bird made a detailed study of eighteen paintings \(held in a secure art warehouse in New Jersey\), which included the removal of frames, photographic documentation of the painted and reverse surfaces, and constant reference to the authorised Golub archive. Bird was required to produce a Report describing the process of close analysis and the reasons for his conclusions – that all the works were not ‘by the hand of the artist’ **\[5.8\]**. This Report was submitted to the lawyers for both the Prosecution and the Defence and was the subject of a Deposition and the primary document tabled during the actual court proceeding. A selection of the suspect works was displayed in court and over two days of explanation and cross\-examination, Bird testified to the reasons for his judgement of the works as forgeries. As a result, the jury found in favour of Hall. The Director of the Hall Art Foundation commented: ‘The role that Professor Bird played in this case was invaluable and most certainly contributed to its positive outcome. The result was of course very desirable for the Hall Collection, but more importantly, to upholding the legacy and integrity of Leon Golub and his work’ **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Through research, consultancy, training delivery, and the creation of tailored Super Recogniser tests, the University of Greenwich has played a critical role in the establishment and staffing of new **Super Recogniser Units** \(SRU\) at the **UK Metropolitan Police Service**, **Munich Police \(Germany**\), **Stuttgart Police**, and **Queensland Police Services \(Australia\),** ultimately increasing identifications and consequently conviction rates with corresponding impact on public safety. The research has also contributed to the creation and improvement of new businesses and services, such as **Super Recognisers International Ltd** \(UK\), **Yoti Ltd** \(UK and India\), and **VisionMetric Ltd** \(UK\). Public interest and awareness have also been impacted via large scale public engagement activities.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 Over £4 billion of public and private funds have been invested in millions of CCTV cameras in the UK, and similar initiatives have occurred in other countries, with the assumption that these will help to deter or solve crime and help with security and public order. However, the full public safety benefit can only be realised with effective identification of people in the images these cameras provide. Not all people have the same abilities to recognise others from faces and so it is important that police officers are selected who are highly accurate in recognising and identifying suspects to undertake this work. This is one of the ways in which research into so\-called **Super\-Recognisers \(SR\)** is important **.** Super\-recognition is studied at the **Centre for Thinking and Learning** at the **Institute for Lifecourse Development**, which was created to support and further develop our long\-standing expertise in applied aspects of cognitive research geared to improving health and wellbeing throughout society. High quality research has been undertaken here by **Davis** and a wider team including **Thompson** for a number of years in the area of super\-recognition, which has had significant societal, commercial and public benefits. 

 **Development of assessments of super\-recognition abilities** 

 Super\-Recognisers \(SR\) are individuals exceptionally accurate at identifying faces of individuals not personally familiar to them, which can both increase identification of suspects and reduce false positives. **Davis** and colleagues have performed extensive research on super\-recognisers, involving both fundamental studies of the cognitive and neurological basis of the abilities **\[3.1, 3.2\]** and, of most importance to the current case study, translational forensic work with the UK Metropolitan Police Service \(MPS\) and other international police and business partners **\[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]**. 

 **Research assessing potential super recognisers in the Metropolitan police force** 

 In 2011 **, Davis** was invited to investigate the facial recognition abilities of a small group of around 25 **Metropolitan Police Service** officers who had made a disproportionately large number of all suspect identifications from London’s CCTV.  Tests of familiar and unfamiliar face recognition and object memory ability were performed by **Davis**’ team to compare high\-performing officers to the general public. This testing identified face\-specific super\-recognition abilities in most high\-performing officers. This research was initially described in **Davis**’ first authored publication “I never forget a face\!” in The Psychologist in 2013, and presented in full through a journal article in Applied Cognitive Psychology in 2016 **\[3.3\]**. The success of this work formed the foundation for future impact with the MPS. 

 **Larger scale studies of super\-recogniser abilities to identify previously unknown suspects** 

 **Davis’** research subsequently played a key role in a project that aimed to improve police digital evidence use, with an applied research focus on CCTV footage search. This €8,500,000 European Commission research funded project, Large Scale Information Exploitation of Forensic Data \(LASIE\), which ran from 2014 to 2017, concerned large\-scale behavioural studies measuring super\-recognition skills required for policing. An essential contribution of the research involved tests of unfamiliar face recognition, which differed conceptually from the pre\-2014 work, as the pre\-LASIE changes made to MPS systems were primarily designed to tap into familiar face recognition of suspects \(e.g., suspects known to the officer from arrests\). The new tests also provided more detailed information on contextualised SR performance, such as SR accuracy in crowded settings, or after long delays \(over 56 days\). This resulted in the further refinement of tests by **Davis** for identifying SRs. These included a Spotting the Face in a Crowd Test **\[3.4**, **3.5\]** and a Long\-Term Face Memory Test **\[3.2\]** to support existing unfamiliar simultaneous face matching and short\-term face memory tests **\[3.6\]**. Officers identified as SRs using these tests performed very highly on suspect identification in their work, a key contributor to the impacts described below.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Davis**’ research has had wide\-ranging impact enhancing the delivery of police services, via improvements in their professional selection methods and policies and the creation of Super\-Recogniser Units. **Davis’** research has also impacted on commerce, via contributions to the creation of new Super\-Recogniser businesses, jobs, and services and improvements of performance; and in the area of public understanding, learning, and engagement, via public interest and awareness of Super\-recognition. The primary pathway to impact fulfilled in the current REF2021 eligibility period was the collaborative research work by **Davis** and his team with the **Metropolitan Police Service** \(MPS\) on super\-recognisers \(SR\) starting in 2011. Suspect identification using CCTV was already regarded by the MPS as a key policing tool for safer neighbourhoods, especially where such identifications led to successful convictions and crime prevention. Results, however, had been disappointing, in particular with regards to human cognitive factors in successful identification. The MPS therefore recognised the need for scientific research into individuals exceptionally proficient at facial recognition and ways to identify such individuals who would be most effective at using CCTV for suspect identification. This led to a close collaboration between **Davis**, the MPS and other international police and business partners in order to resolve this barrier to the potential that CCTV use offers for the identification of suspects. 

 **Impact on the creation of Police Super\-Recogniser units in the UK, Germany and Australia** 

 In August 2014, **MPS Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville** asked **Davis** to provide the names of officers scoring highly on super\-recogniser tests for deployment in two high profile operations: to locate and trace a missing girl in the Alice Gross case \(who was identified by one of the super\-recognisers, as was her murderer\); and to support the Greater Manchester Police investigation for a new Inquest into the Hillsborough Disaster in Sheffield which involved 96 deaths and has the highest death toll in British sporting history \(in which victims were identified by super\-recognisers\). **Davis** provided an initial list of names of 20 officers he had assessed in his earlier research with the police. **Davis**’ research and expert contributions were essential to the understanding that police operations would be more successful with a single department using scientifically identified super\-recognisers for analysis: the **Super\-Recogniser Unit** \(SRU\). This specialist unit was eventually established at New Scotland Yard in May 2015 **\[5.1\]**. The Unfamiliar Face Recognition Test Battery developed by **Davis** and team was subsequently used to identify more SRs for the MPS and other UK forces in the May 2015 \- Oct 2017 period. In the period following the work with the MPS, from 2017 to 2019, **Davis** was asked to consult with police forces including **Munich Police, Stuttgart Police** and **Queensland Police Services**. Drawing on his work and expertise he administered testing to identify SRs, and provided training for them. This work has so far resulted in the creation of **Super\-Recogniser Units \(SRU\) within Stuttgart** in 2018 **, Munich** in 2019 and **Queensland Police Services** in 2019. 

 **Impact on police identification of suspects in the UK, Germany and Australia** 

 Use of identified specialist SR police officers vastly improved suspect identification rates in the UK, from around 50 per week prior to the creation of the MPS **Super\-Recogniser Unit** \(SRU\) to around 250 per week in 2015/2016 **\[5.1\]**. The Unit made around 2,250 identifications between May 2015 and December 2017 **\[5.1\]**. It can be estimated that these identifications translate into a significant increase in convictions with around a 50% conversion rate **\[5.1\]**. Suspects and victims for a number of high\-profile events have been identified by SRU members selected using the testing provided by the University of Greenwich including in the **Skripal** **Novichok poison murder case** in 2018  \( [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/world/europe/salisbury\-novichok\-poisoning.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/world/europe/salisbury-novichok-poisoning.html)\) and the **Austin Caballero serial theft case** in 2016 **\[5.1\]**. In the **Munich Police**, over 4500 officers were tested between December 2017 and April 2018 and the SRU was established in October 2018 and fully operational by September 2019. The leads generated by the Unit were used to link different crimes together and provide a name of the suspect; most leads were deemed “helpful” by investigating teams **\[5.2\]**. Munich Police reported a large impact with 1800 suspects identified in the first four months of establishing their unit **\[5.2\]**. From mid\-2018, and stemming from **Davis**’ presentations and a University of Greenwich consultancy agreement with him, **Stuttgart Police** started testing their staff for super\-recognition abilities and including certification for those identified as such. Up to July 2019, over 2000 staff members have taken the tests, but more importantly, the skills of SRs found in this way were used to support police operations in the Stuttgart riots of June 2020 and are regularly used in football stadiums in Stuttgart to identify banned fans **\[5.3\]**. The results of this collaboration have led to the decision to provide all officers with the opportunity to be tested by the University of Greenwich in the future **\[5.3\]**. In **Queensland Police Services** \(QPS\), the SRU has identified over 300 suspects across the state, the highest number of identifications in their 160\-year history. The partnership with **Davis** and the University of Greenwich has also enhanced awareness in the QPS of facial recognition and facial identification, and supported **the QPS Strategic plan** and its statement of purpose which is: ‘In collaboration with community, government and non\-government partners, provide effective, high quality and responsive policing services to make Queensland safer’ **\[5.4\]**. 

 **Impact on commercial Super\-Recogniser services** 

 Since 2017, the agency **Super Recognisers International \(SRI\) Ltd** has provided consultancy in SR\-informed investigations, SR recruitment and contracting services, and training of SRs, for clients in **law enforcement, defence, the security sector, legal professions, and other businesses \(including broadcasters, concert/festival hosts, football stadiums\)**. SRI was established by Mick Neville after retiring from the MPS, extending the application of SR research into the commercial domain. **Davis** has supported SRI’s core business offering from their beginnings through providing the most current SR expertise, testing methods tailored for the agency, advice and guidance. This has enabled them to better serve clients such as **SeeQuestor, Facewatch, O2 Arena, Camelot, SBS Broadcasting \(Australia\), NHK Broadcasting \(Japan\), Iridium Security, and police forces such as City Police, Thames Valley Police and States of Jersey Police \[5.1\]**. 

 **Impact on the creation of internationally recognised professional standards certification process as a super\-recogniser** 

 The key to SRI’s reputation has been in ensuring the international standard of their SRs, using the only globally recognised certification of SRs via licenses of the Association of Super\-Recognisers \(ASR\).  The SR testing used by the Association for this certification is that developed by **Davis** and is provided via the University of Greenwich **\[5.1\]**. This certification, mandated by SRI, also requires recruits to attend training courses on behavioural analysis/detection, gait analysis and facial mapping. **Davis** and his team provide expertise, and assist SRI with the training, on the latter. In doing so, they have actively supported the competitiveness of SRI Ltd, whilst also underpinning the Association of Super\-Recogniser’s mission to drive up standards via a members’ Code of Conduct, and helping to realise their vision of establishing super\-recognition as a forensic science in its own right. To date more than 100 people from a number of countries have completed the ASR certification process, including staff from the **City of London Police, Thames Valley Police, Queensland Police, US border control, MPS, Norwegian Police** **\[5.1\]**. 

 **Impact on commercial identification\-verification services** 

 **Yoti Ltd** are an identity verification company started in 2014, which services individuals, government, and businesses who require identity verification, and are based in the UK and India. They also cover the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as distinct regions, with clients including the **NHS, Co\-op, NSPCC, and Age UK**. The Government of Jersey is a client of Yoti and 10% of the Jersey adult population currently use their services \(i.e., around 8500 individuals\). The Yoti app has been downloaded to over nine million phones around the world. The company’s valuation in 2019 was around £80 million \( [https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti\-raises\-8m\-equity\-investment/](https://www.yoti.com/blog/yoti-raises-8m-equity-investment/)\). The company has been able to strongly benefit from **Davis’** work **\[5.5\]**: From 2015 to 2020, Yoti employed around 35 full time SRs to support their UK operations and over 115 for their India region, all of whom were selected during recruitment involving more than 10,000 applicants which used **Davis’s** SR test batteries, and who subsequently underwent training informed by his team.  The role of these SRs is essential to Yoti’s business in that they check documents and facial photos as part of an identification verification process generated by client requests \(around 6 million carried out to date\). This research informed expertise was provided to Yoti via consultancy agreements with the university, and **Davis** continues to support staff recruitment via expertise and training. In doing so, **Davis’** team has played a key role in supporting Yoti’s core business offering, and in enhancing their brand in support of their stated mission ‘to become the world’s most trusted identity platform’. 

 **Impact on the development of commercial facial composite software** 

 **VisionMetric Ltd** are a UK\-based facial composite software company who have created the program EFIT6 for creating facial composites through a process of selecting and rejecting complete faces \(as opposed to individual features\) ultimately geared to evolving the composite to represent the target face. A new algorithm – E2ID – is being developed via the collaboration, aiming to match facial composites against police databases of mugshots. Since February 2020, and incorporated into **Davis’** public engagement work described below, participants have so far made 1 million similarity ratings of pairs of images used as essential data to drive the machine learning algorithm of E2ID’s artificial intelligence. In this way **Davis**’ team are supporting product design and development at Visionmetric through their research and a unique application of citizen science **\[5.6\]**. 

 **Public interest in, and awareness of, Super Recognition** 

 The publicity generated by the SR research, particularly in terms of policing successes, has resulted in over 100 media articles, TV and radio appearances by **Davis**. A website,  [www.superrecognisers.com](http://www.superrecognisers.com/), has been created to support this engagement. It is clear that the public are fascinated by SRs, as over 6,000,000 worldwide participants have completed a fun “Could you be a super\-recogniser?” test on the website in the 5 years since it was placed online in April 2015 **\[3.6\]**. On completion participants are offered opportunities to participate in future research and help pilot police tests \- approximately 200,000 have participated in follow\-up research, and 44,800 have left contact details to be invited to more \(per April 2020\).  As part of an integrated citizen science project, 20,000 participants have contributed to the E2ID face matching algorithm development described in the VisionMetric collaboration above **\[5.6\]** This widespread media attention and active public participation reflects an intense interest in super\-recognition that **Davis** has actively nurtured via awareness\-raising and understanding enhancement. This has occurred at general public level, but also at a personal level whereby the curiosity of individuals as to their SR potential has been stimulated \- participation spurred on by the latter is helping to identify ever more SRs and aid further research. 

 The research by **Davis** has inspired at least two authors to write novels in which SRs were protagonists: J.S. Monroe, *The Other You* \(2020\), which reached Amazon Kindle’s Top 100 chart in 2020, and T. Darnton, *The Truth about Lies*, \(2018\), shortlisted in 2019 for the Waterstone’s Children’s Book Prize, the Centurion Book Award, and the Concorde Book Award. **Davis** consulted directly with these authors, and both acknowledge **Davis**’ contribution, especially with regards to helping ensure scientific accuracy and plot development for their novels **\[5.7\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel University London has worked with Enertechnos to research, develop and commercialise a new Capacitive Transfer System \(CTS\) cable which reduces energy loss by between 10% and 20%. The cable can be manufactured, installed and maintained with existing equipment. It also requires less infrastructure, such as booster stations, reducing the capital cost of projects by up to 40%. As a result of Brunel’s research Enertechnos has revised its company strategy, grown its staff from four to fourteen, substantially strengthened its patent portfolio and secured further investment. It has also developed in\-house technical capabilities to model and deliver solutions to its customers, making use of a bespoke multilevel invertor developed by Brunel to simulate long lengths of CTS cable. The company has an agreement to oversee the delivery and installation of 15 miles of cable to Western Power Distribution as part of a programme of delivery across its 4 networks. It has sold a commercial licence for manufacture in Europe for GBP250,000 per annum and is on track to sell a further 4 licences to international manufacturers. The CEO has been able to influence both UK public policy on electricity pricing as well as at US Energy Industry events with an invitation from American Electric Power.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In the UK, the present network of transmission cables used to distribute energy from power generators to loads is faced with a number of challenges that are exacerbated by the move to bring more renewable energy to the grid. The research of Dr Mohamed Darwish at Brunel University London \[1\] on Capacitive Transfer System \(CTS\) cable has addressed two of the major challenges and enabled Enertechnos to bring new products to the market. 

 One challenge is the fluctuation of power along cables \- for example, when renewable energy generators such as wind farms work are at the upper limit of power generation, there is a voltage drop at the receiving end due to high load current \(power loss\). Conversely, when the power load is low, there is a voltage rise at the receiving end \(the Ferranti effect\). These phenomena are further pronounced when the length of the cable increases. Series capacitors have been successfully used to enhance stability of high transmission networks, however these are expensive devices. \[2\]. 

 While maintaining a similarity to conventional cables, Dr Darwish’s team re\-designed the CTS cable by conducting multi\-physics simulations including electric, magnetic and thermal finite element analysis to simulate the various designs of CTS cable to deliver the best prototypes for testing. 

 The re\-designed multi\-layer cables increase the conductive area in the wires by increasing the dielectric layers between input and output wires. These additional dielectric layers balance the main conductor inductance. The result is that CTS cables deliver increased power and reduced line voltage drop of between 10% and 20% when delivering the same load current because it is able to balance line reactance which is beneficial for long\-distance high\-capacity power transmission and distribution. This means that less power is needed at the power generation end to compensate for the voltage drops to deliver sufficient power. 

 CTS cable works as both a capacitor device and a transmission line in normal operating conditions, which provides the feasibility to offset the inductive reactance of wires by capacitive energy transfer between wires. Consequently, unlike any other existing cables, CTS can compensate for the reactive power used inductive loads. 

 Finally, CTS improves system performance. From a systematic view, CTS improves the load current and power quality, delivering more power to a local delivery point, so other lines connected to this point will benefit with a lesser power transfer requirement, resulting in less energy loss overall. 





 Fig 1: Cross section of CTS enamel \(left\)  and CTS Multi\-layer \(right\)   Fig 2: Top view of CTS enamel \(bottom\)  and CTS Multi\-layer \(top\) 

 The research team developed two types of cable: CTS enamel and CTS multi\-layer. Both achieve the improvements as described above, however they have slight differences depending on the voltage level applications. 

 The CTS cable reduces the need for AC booster transformers or HVDC converter stations which can comprise up to 40% of project capital investment, since CTS has materially less voltage drop than its traditional counterpart. CTS has also been designed so that it can be manufactured on existing production lines at cable manufacturers.  Furthermore, the cables have been designed so that they can be joined together using existing equipment that power distribution networks have on their installation and maintenance vans. Both these features make the new cable cheaper to manufacture, install and maintain, increasing the likelihood of take up by the power distribution network. 

 In addition to the development of the cables, Dr Darwish’s research team also developed a multilevel inverter that can generate electricity at high frequency and high power. This enabled the research team to be able to use small lengths of cable to emulate the conditions of long length cables that would be in use for power transmission. While multilevel inverters exist, there was no suitable inverter commercially available that could provide the appropriate level of power needed in the test and simulation environment. This inverter is now in use at Enertechnos.

 The research project, *Capacitively coupled cables for transmission and distribution of electrical power*, was granted by Innovate UK from November 2017 to March 2019. It was awarded to Enertechnos, Brunel University and TWI. The total amount of grant was GBP1,094,152. 
","
###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 In 2016\-17 the UK lost 26,554 GWh in the transmission and distribution of electrical power which was an increase of 1.8% over the previous year \[BEIS, Digest of UK Energy Statistics \(DUKES\) report 2018\]. This loss is enough to power 7,000,000 homes and at retail prices, this power is worth GBP3,300,000,000 per annum. 1.5% of the UK’s CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are attributable to power transmission losses.  In comparison, the whole of the aviation sector equates to 2%. \(OFGEM, Losses Incentive Mechanisms 2014\). \[E1\] 

 Enertechnos was founded in 2013 to develop, patent and commercialise the Capacitive Transfer System \(CTS\) as a new concept in ultra\-low loss cables based on capacitance technology. In 2017 the company, along with Brunel University and two other partners, secured InnovateUK funding of just over GBP1,000,000 to develop and test the cable to improve the capacitance of its initial prototypes. \[E2, E3, E4\] 

 The work of Dr Mohamed Darwish and his research team at Brunel University on this project \[E5\] was core to the development of this technology and advanced it to the point where Enertechnos has been able to secure future contracts and determine the future direction of Enertechnos as a company. The work undertaken to develop the CTS technology during this project led to the company winning the 2018\-19 Rushlight Energy Environmental Award \[E6\]. 

 **Company Strategy** 

 Enertechnos has been able to leverage GBP7,100,000 in funding to increase its staff. The company was started with 4 staff in 2013 and now has 9 full time staff. It had expected to grow to 14 staff by the end of 2020 but these have been delayed due to the Covid\-19 Pandemic. \[E7\] 

 The company has also invested in its own in\-house research and development capabilities. Recruiting two engineers trained by Dr Darwish to ensure ongoing knowledge transfer, Enertechnos has been able to work with its partners to model and develop solutions for its customers. Enertechnos stated: “The work of the research team has enabled the company to apply for further patents. We currently hold 15 granted international patents for this technology and have applied for three further patents since the project was completed in March 2019”. 

 **Market Development** 

 Enertechnos’ business strategy has been to licence the product to cable manufacturers rather than manufacture it themselves on existing production lines. A key approach to the research and development of the product was to ensure that cable manufacturers did not have to install new technology in order to encourage the adoption of their cables. 

 Meanwhile, the company has been using its expertise to work with power distribution companies and the wider power networks to create the opportunities for licenced cable manufacturers to sell the products in return for a 5% royalty from each sale. 

 **Licences** 

 Enertechnos has sold one licence to Tratos who were a partner in the InnovateUK project. The licence value is initially discounted at GBP250,000 per annum and covers manufacture of the product in Europe. It is expected that the cable manufacture for UK sales will be undertaken at Tratos’s UK factory in Liverpool which will secure jobs in the north west. Enertechnos is in discussion with other companies with a view to securing sales of a further four licences internationally by the end of 2020. 

 **Sales to Distribution Networks** 

 Enertechnos has been working closely with Western Power Distribution, a distribution network operator \(DNO\) that holds 4 of 14 UK licences. OFGEM requires all DNOs to reduce power losses and our solution is one that they have been keen to explore. Enertechnos has an agreement to deliver 15 miles of cable to be laid and tested. This had been planned for spring 2020 but has been delayed, partly due to Covid\-19. It is now expected that this will be installed in Spring 2021. Following this trial, the company is planning to use the CTS cable underground in an area of outstanding national beauty in Wales where overhead cables are not permitted and the alternative option would be to install cable around the site. Enertechnos has a letter of intent. 

 Following these trials, Enertechnos is expecting Western Power to use CTS in its upgrade works across its four licensed areas. Its arrangement with Western Power is at this stage exclusive however, the company intends to extend its product to the other DNOs in the OFGEM network. 

 **International Opportunities** 

 Enertechnos’ CEO was invited by American Electric Power to speak at an EPRI \(Electric Power Research Industry\) event to present CTS and its benefits in May 2019. This led to advanced discussions with an American cable manufacturer Southwire to have the first US Licence with some agreement for exclusivity. Similar to its work in the UK, Enertechnos is working with National Grid USA which holds a distribution licence in the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New York. The company is seeking to use CTS as a solution to enable them to meet high power needs caused by increased demand due to products such as electric cars whilst managing the constraints created by the cables being laid in ducts. The increased capacity of CTS will enable the company to find a medium\-term solution as it prepares for a long\-term solution. If successful, Southwire will manufacture the CTS cable and supply the company. In addition, the company is in discussion with a number of national and international companies to utilise CTS for applications in sub\-marine and mining environments. 

 **Engagement with Policy** 

 Enertechnos wants to raise awareness of power loss in cables and seeks to educate policy makers with a view to introducing CTS as a solution. To this end, the CEO has had numerous meetings with cabinet and shadow cabinet ministers including Kwasi Kwarteng MP – Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth and his shadow cabinet counterpart Dr Alan Whitehead MP; MPs from all the main UK political parties and officials at BEIS and OFGEM. 

 In 2019, the Enertechnos CEO was invited to participate on the OFGEM Working Group on RIIO\-ED2 which will determine the price controls to regulate the electricity distribution networks from 2023 \(report forthcoming – July 2020\). This committee sets the criteria and incentives for energy loss reduction and its regulations will ultimately impact on the consumer. All these opportunities were made possible by Brunel’s research and the availability of CTS as a solution to power losses. 

 As the CEO of Enertechnos states: “…we would not be in a position to be able to explore the variety of opportunities that we are had we not worked with Dr Darwish and his research team on the Innovate UK project. “ 

 **Carbon savings**: 

 CTS provides a number of carbon savings. The reduction of energy loss by 10\-20% along a CTS cable will enable a reduction in power generation at source. Overall, if we assume that 60% of fuel comes from carbon sources, this could provide a carbon reduction of between 6 and 12%. \[E5\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This impact is based upon the creation of a new statistical methodology that deepens and textures our ability to harvest information from a regression analysis. The GAMLSS methodology allows the modelling of a response variable using any theoretical distribution including highly skewed or/and kurtotic distributions and the modelling of all the parameters of the distribution. 

  

 The main beneficiaries are practitioners dealing with highly skewed and kurtotic data. Such data sets are very common in environmental and financial communities. This case study demonstrates that GAMLSS models were used in several important instances leading to better understanding and changes in policies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape \(GAMLSS\) were introduced by Stasinopoulos and Rigby in 2005, in a Royal Statistical Society read paper \(with discussion\), \[R1\]. 

  

 Prior to the development of GAMLSS methodology, response variables in a regression framework were often modelled based on the assumption of the exponential family of distributions. For continuous response variables, typically, this would be the normal, the gamma or the inverse Gaussian distribution. For discrete data this would be the Poisson or the binomial distribution. However, many response variables are either heavy tailed or/and highly skewed.  For example, high frequency data in econometric or finance, river flows, web traffic data and text classification data. In GAMLSS, the distribution of the response variable can be continuous, discrete or mixed. A mixed distribution is a continuous distribution with discrete parts such as, for example, a zero inflated gamma distribution. GAMLSS also allows all the parameters of the distribution to be modelled as linear or non\-linear smooth functions of the exploratory variables. Those parameters are often location, scale and shape parameters. Since all parameters are modelled, the distribution of the response variable can vary in shape according to explanatory variables. This results in more realistic models in which both rare events as well as the centre of the distribution can be modelled, accurately. This leads to better understanding of how such incidences occurred and and therefore can be used to inform more effective policies which help to mitigate risks. 

 GAMLSS solves problems inherited from the stricter assumptions of the popular GLM and the GAM regression models: i\) heterogeneity in variance, ii\) positive or negative skewness, iii\) \`platy' or \`lepto' kurtosis, iv\) over or under dispersion, v\) excess or shortage of zeros and vi\) variance\-mean relationships. Case \(iii\) above is closely related to the theory of ""heavy tails"", common in financial and environmental data where \`rare' events do occur more often. Cases \(iv\) to \(v\) are common to discrete response variables. The monograph \[R4\] is a testimony of the commitment of Stasinopoulos and Rigby in developing appropriate theoretical distributions to solve real problems. The monograph contains details of more than 100 distributions. It also shows how extra distributions can be generated and applied to real data examples. 

  

 London Metropolitan University is the main hub for the current and future development of GAMLSS.  All co\-authors of the GAMLSS books are visiting researchers and contributed to the work of the Statistics Operation Research and Mathematics centre of London Met.  Dr Voudouris, is chief data officer for Argus media, Dr De Bastiani is a lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco, Brazil, and Professor Heller, is working at the Clinical Trials Centre of University of Sydney.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The benefits of a more realistic modelling of phenomena, by GAMLSS, leads to a better understanding of how those incidences occurred and therefore supports more effective policies which help to mitigate risk. The beneficiaries have been environmental, economic or regulatory agents, wishing to understand and prevent potentially damaging events. 

 <ins> **Financial Sector risk modelling**</ins> 

 In 2015, the International Monetary Fund \(IMF\) used GAMLSS for a stress testing exercise of the US economy \[S1\].  A key mission of the IMF is to periodically conduct assessments under the Financial Services Action Program \(FSAP\). “ *These assessments involve a considerable amount of data analysis and quantitative modelling. It is in this context that the GAMLSS work has been extremely relevant to us.*”  GAMLSS was found to be highly useful in the U.S. FSAP context, because it is “ *an extremely flexible model class that allowed* \[them\] *to: \(i\) utilize a wide variety of distributions to characterize the response variable and \(ii\) explicitly model the first four moments of these distributions as functions of exogenous conditions. As a result,* \[they found\] *the framework well suited to address the presence of tail\-risks, nonlinearities, and deviations from the normality assumption. The default probability data used in the stress testing exercise exhibited all of these characteristics, thereby motivating the choice of the GAMLSS model class for stress testing purposes.”* \[S1 p86\] 

 The GAMLSS model for the U.S. financial system suggested “ *that macroeconomic, sector credit risk, and interconnectivity influence credit risk in the United States in significant—and often nonlinear\-ways.*” \[S1 p88\] The GAMLSS results underscored *“the importance of spillovers across sectors*” and across borders. \[S1 p91\] The approach usefully complemented other risk analysis used in the 2015 U.S. FSAP. The analysis yielded specific findings, suggestions and **recommendations for improvement** including conducting “ *regular, comprehensive stress tests for all major financial sub\-sectors that capture the impact of macro\-financial factors, spillover and feedback effects between institutions and interactions between solvency and liquidity*” and “ *more intensive monitoring of systemic financial sector risks, including the use of market\-based solvency and shortfall measures.”* \[S1 p10\]. 

 Speaking of his “ *deep appreciation for the world class research by Professors Dimitrios Stasinopoulos and Robert Rigby, in developing*” GAMLSS, the Division Chief at the IMF observed that the “ *work has yielded an important positive contribution to our activities at the International Monetary Fund*,” noting that having worked at the IMF since 2000 and “ *with many models and analytical tools, but the GAMLSS truly stands thanks to its combination of innovativeness, analytical rigor, and applicability.”*\[S2\] In the context of the stress testing exercise of the US economy, he reports that the *“use of GAMLSS helped to change our understanding of the vulnerability”* of the US financial sector. 

 Summarising the contribution of GAMLSS to the IMF, the Division Chief states “ *the innovative research by Prof. Stasinopoulos and Prof. Rigby has been useful for the IMF’s work on assessing financial sector risk in the U.S. The analysis yielded specific findings and suggestions that were discussed in detail with our technical level counterparts during the FSAP.”* These informed their “ *higher level policy recommendations* \[which were\] *discussed with top policy makers at the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve, other key agencies as well as with other stakeholders.”\[*S2\]. 

 The benefits of GAMLSS are demonstrated by its widespread usage by statisticians in non\-academic settings, particularly within the financial regulatory sector: 

 i\) The **European parliament** report, \[S3\], aimed to provide a quantitative assessment of the macro\-economic cost of a possible banking crisis within the Euro zone. 

 ii\) The **Bank of England**, \[S4\], to estimate the UK mortgage market vulnerabilities from load\-level data. 

 iii\) The **Standard Chartered Bank** \(SCB\), \[S5\] to “ *provide a macroeconomic balance sheet projections and corporate planning*”. The SCB employs more than 86,000 people and has a presence in 60 countries and territories in Europe and Americas, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. 

 iv\) The **Bank of America**, \(BoA\) “ *to develop credit risk models*” specifically to benchmark “ *loss given default \(LGD\) and exposure at default*” \(EAD\) \[S6\]. BoA has asset size of USD2.2 tn \(Sep 2020\), 2nd largest bank in the US, 8th largest in the world. 

 The team leader of Quantitative Modelling and Analytics at the SCB, reports that *“the GAMLSS toolbox is particularly appealing to us for its transparency, range of various smoothers, choice of distributions and ability to address the presence of tail\-risks, nonlinearities, and deviations from the normality assumptions*”. He notes that the GAMLSS *“models provide baseline view of the bank’s key product performance under various macroeconomic scenarios. This information is used by the top management to plan business development more efficiently into the future and spot new business opportunities”.* \[S5\] 

 <ins> **Environment and ecosystem**</ins> 

 Southern Water’s 2019 Draft Water Resources Management Plan describes how they developed their artificial weather generator for simulating rainfall for water resource model using GAMLSS because “ *these models allow the incorporation of the large\-scale climate indices \(NAO, SST\) and determine their relation to single rain gauge sites or gridded rainfall data”.* \[S7\] The resulting model “ *is now fully parametric and predicts rainfall for all seasons directly. This has thus removed issues relating to lack of persistence which were associated bootstrap sampling of spring\-autumnal rainfall*” in the earlier model. \[S7 p27\]. The new model not only “ *produces spatially and temporally coherent monthly rainfall time series*,” as a result of using GAMLSS, it also reproduces extreme rainfall patterns which is “ *unique to this model and has not been attempted or demonstrated elsewhere*.”\[S7 p28\] 

 Globally, seagrass meadows are one of the planet’s significant carbon absorption assets as well as being nursery habitats for fish and invertebrates, important food source for marine life and helping to stabilise and maintain the seabed. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Marine Monitoring Program has used GAMLSS to build models to monitor the health and condition of seagrass in the Great Barrier Reef. The resulting report notes that the GAMLSS models, used to “ *determine whether seagrass data collected*” could “ *predict subsequent seagrass coverage*” concluded that while “ *the high level of uncertainty associated with the reproductive effort index* \[hindered\] *the value of this indicator for assessing ecosystem health,*” the results supported “ *the assertion that species diversity and productivity are good indicators of resilience*.” \[S9\] The research statistician with CSIRO advised that it is “ *essential that the condition of seagrass is measured, monitored and reported accurately*.” Their models predicting seagrass abundance and reproductive effort \[S9\] are being used to “ *inform and refine future seagrass data collection and reporting in the Great Barrier Reef to ensure that this essential part of the ecosystem is monitored appropriately and management actions*” undertaken.\[S8\]

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This issue of job quality has long been at the forefront of national and international policy agenda, but there is a shortage of empirical evidence on how to improve job quality. Drawing on large scale European labour market data, Dr Ying Zhou’s research \(co\-authored with Professor Duncan Callie\) highlights the impact of employee involvement on work motivation, skill development and subjective well\-being. Her work provides strong support for the view that there are mutual benefits of high involvement for both employees and employers. This research influenced the OECD Job Quality Framework and the associated Guidelines to implement and monitor the Framework. The EU has used the research to build the argument for better member state national policies on well\-being at work. The research is also used in English and Welsh policies to support improved job quality. 
","
 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the last decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in the issue of job quality following the European Council’s Lisbon Growth and Job Strategy that calls for the creation of ‘more and better jobs’ as a central policy goal for the European Union. Dr Ying Zhou’s research focuses on job quality which lies at the interface of national and international policies to improve economic growth and competitiveness on the one hand and policies to reinforce employees’ social rights and personal well\-being on the other. There has been a long debate on whether these economic and social objectives are mutually reinforcing rather than requiring a trade\-off of benefits. Over the last decade Dr Ying Zhou has published extensively on the impact of employee involvement on work motivation \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\], skill development \[3.2, 3.4, 3.5\] and subjective well\-being \[3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6\], showing that there are benefits for both employees and employers when high involvement is encouraged. 

 In 2012 and again in 2019, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions \(Eurofound\) invited Dr Ying Zhou \(with Professor Duncan Gallie from Oxford University\) to provide research evidence on the forms of work organisation that encourage both labour productivity and employee well\-being across the EU member states. Drawing on data in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> European Working Conditions Surveys, their reports Work Organization and Employee Involvement in Europe \[3.3\] and Employee Involvement, Work Engagement and Skill Development \[3.4\] show that employees in high involvement organisations, characterised by higher levels of job autonomy and wider organisational participation, experience a wide range of positive outcomes such as safer physical working conditions, stronger work motivation, greater learning and skill development opportunities and better physical and psychological well\-being. The main findings from the second report were published as an EU policy brief in English, French, German and Spanish in June 2020 \[3.5\]. 

 Despite the wide range of benefits associated with high involvement organisations, the majority of employees in Europe were found to be employed in low involvement organisations where individuals lack discretion over their work tasks and have little say over broader organisational decisions that affect them \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5\]. Employees in the Nordic countries stand out as having the highest levels of involvement while those in southern and south\-eastern European countries are subjected to particularly tight managerial control. These differences remain evident even after controlling for economic structure and workforce composition, which points to the role of national policies in promoting inclusiveness at work. Furthermore, the differences in job quality between countries appear impervious to the impact of the economic crisis. Drawing on the European Social Survey series, they compared job quality in nineteen European countries before and after the 2008\-9 economic recession and found little change in the pattern by country or region \[3.6\]. These findings testify to the stability of institutional arrangements in the face of short\-term economic shocks, reflecting their embeddedness in complex and interdependent formal rule systems. 

 In sum, the research shows that the twin objectives of economic growth and employee well\-being can be achieved through the adoption of high involvement management. Encouraging employee involvement in workplace decision\-making will not only satisfy individuals’ inherent needs for self\-determination but also increase work motivation and skill development, which will lead to smart, inclusive and sustainable economic growth.

 Dr Ying Zhou’s cross\-national comparative research on job quality has informed national and international policies designed to improve job quality through the OECD, the European Commission and in England and Wales. 

  

 <ins>OECD policy</ins> 

 In 2013, Dr Ying Zhou and Professor Duncan Gallie were invited to present their research on job autonomy and work intensity \[3.6\] at the OECD in Paris, in preparation for the development of the OECD Job Quality Framework. This workshop was attended by Jean\-Paul Tricart \(Head of Unit for Social Dialogue and Industrial Relations, European Commission\), Marco Mira D’Ercole \(Head of Household Statistics and Progress Measurement Division, OECD\) and Mark Keese \(Head of Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs\). Mark Keese oversaw the subsequent development of the OECD Job Quality Framework \[5.1\], while Alexander Hijzen, who moderated the Q&A at the workshop, drafted the Framework. The Framework identified three broad dimensions of job quality: earnings, labour market security and quality of the working environment. Job autonomy, as identified in Dr Zhou’s presentation, was recognised as a key aspect of a good working environment \[5.1, p18\-19\] \[5.2\]. The OECD Job Quality Framework was officially adopted in the G20 Labour and Employment Ministers’ Ankara Declaration in 2015 \[5.3\]. At the Heads of States Summit, Ministers of Labour and Employment from G20 members and invited countries accepted the importance of job quality as a policy goal, acknowledging that ‘quality jobs are important as a key driver of greater well\-being for individuals and society” \[5.3 Clause 23 Annex IV\]. 

 To facilitate the implementation of the policy recommendations from the Job Quality Framework, the OECD was asked by the G20 members to create Guidelines on Measuring the Quality of the Working Environment \[5.4\]. The Guidelines were launched at the EU’s Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg in 2017 which gathered heads of state and social partners to work on well\-functioning and fair European labour markets, effective and sustainable social protection systems and the promotion of social dialogue at all levels. Dr Ying Zhou’s research on the distribution and trends in employee involvement in Europe was cited five times in the Guidelines document \[5.4, Chapter 3\]. The research is cited in support of the fact that ‘reliable data available for monitoring the quality of the working environment is essential for policy \[…\] to improve working conditions’ \[5.4 p58\]. In particular, knowledge of the sectors of the workforce which are particularly vulnerable to poor working environment is essential for developing effective policy interventions to improve employee well\-being. 

  

 <ins>European policy</ins> 

 Dr Ying Zhou was invited to present her research at Eurofound \(European Union’s main research agency on working conditions\) at a series of meetings held in Dublin and Brussels \[5.5\]. In 2014 her research \[3.3\] was presented at a joint workshop by the European Commission and OECD in Brussels and cited in the subsequently published 2015 European Commission policy document Employment and Social Developments in Europe \[5.6\] ‘which informed EU policies to improve organisational effectiveness and employee welfare.’ \[5.5\]. The research was used to indicate that work intensity can be beneficial when combined with choice, and to recognise that job autonomy is embedded in wider institutional structures. 

 In 2019 Dr Ying Zhou presented her research in Dublin to Eurofound’s Senior Advisory Committee which consists of representatives from governments, employers and trade unions from EU member states. The research was later presented to the Dutch Prime Minister’s Scientific Council and the European Council’s Working Party on Social Questions during the Finnish Presidency. In June 2020, the EU released Council Conclusions on Enhancing Well\-being at Work which used the research \[3.3\] to support the call for enhanced employee involvement \[5.7\] and more broadly called on member states to develop policies to support the well\-being at work agenda. This is acknowledged by Eurofound as “a significant achievement, in particular, as work organisation issue traditionally falls under the concept of subsidiarity, highlighting thus the original and ground\-breaking contributions that the report is making.” \[5.5\]. The Conclusions are supported by a policy brief \[5.8\] published by Eurofound and co\-authored by Dr Ying Zhou, which is used to ‘inform EU labour market policies’ \[5.5\]. 

  

 <ins>UK policy</ins> 

 Dr Ying Zhou’s research has also influenced UK government policy on job quality and employee well\-being. In 2013, Professor Duncan Gallie presented their joint research \[3.3, 3.6\] on the impact of economic recession on job quality in Europe to the Cabinet Office at No 10 Downing Street, with a particular focus on employee involvement. Their research was cited in the subsequently published 2014 UK Wellbeing and Policy Report authored by the former Cabinet Secretary Lord Gus O’Donnell and other prominent social scientists \[5.9\]. More recently Dr Ying Zhou drafted the Good Work Index Report \[5.10\] for the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development \(CIPD\) which uses it to support its 150,000 members in HR to improve the quality of working lives. 

 Finally, Dr Ying Zhou’s research \[3.3, 3.6\] has also influenced Welsh Government policy. Recognising the importance of fair work for achieving a modernised and inclusive economy, the First Minister commissioned Professor Linda Dickens MBE to Chair the Fair Work Commission and make recommendations to improve job quality. ‘Fair Work Wales’ was published in May 2019 on the Welsh Government website \[5.11\]. Ying Zhou’s work was cited, and her contribution acknowledged in the report. Since the publication of the report, the Welsh government has set up the Social Partnership and Fair Work Directorate and secured a Social Partnership Act in Wales through the parliament to take forward the recommendations of the Fair Work Commission \[5.12\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers in Kent’s Personal Social Services Research Unit \(PSSRU\) have developed a highly valued health and social care unit cost data resource – Unit Costs for Health and Social Care \(UCH&SC\) – that is used extensively by the UK Government. Its impacts are evident in the development of legislation, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) clinical guidelines and approval of new medical treatments, Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) policies, and service commissioning. Reports and testimonials from the NHS, the National Audit Office, NICE, and the DHSC demonstrate that it makes a significant contribution to the evidence base for policy and practice that affects millions of people using health and social care services across England. It has also had international impact, particularly in Canada, where it is used as a model for the development of mental health unit costs. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 A good understanding of the way money flows through organisations and feeds into services is crucial if an organisation wishes to ensure a high quality of service provision. Researchers at the University of Kent developed the Unit Cost of Health and Social Care resource, which estimates the cost of the resources used in service provision and produces a unique volume of health and social care data. Every year the research programme makes further progress in improving and extending knowledge about the cost of services and improving the underlying routine information, enabling policy\-makers across the full range of health and social care services to make better decisions. Researchers in the Personal Social Services Research Unit \(PSSRU\) at Kent collate, analyse, and integrate existing research findings in order to estimate the unit costs that are disseminated widely in the Unit’s annual  [volumes](http://www.pssru.ac.uk/project-information.php?id=354). This unique research programme includes the following categories: 

 *The development and application of robust cost estimation approaches based in economic theory* **\[R1\-R3\].** Research by Curtis and Beecham builds on PSSRU’s standardised, theory\-driven approach to develop a unique set of new unit costs that include all relevant items \(salaries, on\-costs, other service\-related revenue and capital costs, training and qualification costs, and organisational overheads\). Long\-run marginal opportunity cost are calculated. The marginal cost is the cost of supporting one extra client or providing one additional unit of output and it is long\-run in recognition of the financial implications of necessary expansion. Throughout, the economic concept of opportunity cost is used, this taking into account the fact that the use of resources in one way prevents their use in other ways. The transparency of the methods and resulting robust unit costs make a major contribution to improving the quality of central and local policy decision\-making, and economic research. 

 *Secondary data analysis based on routinely collected data* **\[R1, R2, R5\]**. The researchers’ analysis of the NHS Consolidated Accounts has improved cost estimates for NHS Trust overheads. Few individual research studies collect these costs, although an accurate reflection of overheads is paramount, as they account for about half of the full cost of providing services **\[R1\]**. The PSSRU research\-based approach uses the Labour Force Survey data to estimate the expected working life of professionals **\[R2, R5\]**. This data informs understanding of the likely length of working lives and informs the costs that is determined for qualifying professionals. 

 *Undertaking or working with provider organisations to collect primary data on services and analysing such data to arrive at a nationally applicable cost.* In\-house activities have included an online survey of how professionals spend their working time \(UCH&SC, 2016\), and work to estimate land values and other building\-related costs \(with the Valuation Office Agency and the Building Cost Information Service\). Curtis and Beecham have also worked with organisations to establish the unit costs of specific services; for example, work with Foundations **\[R6\]** and the Autistic Alliance \(UCH&SC, 2015 and 2017\). 

 *Focused and wide\-ranging literature searches*. The UCH&SC volumes aim to draw together research\-based information that contributes to unit costs. The collation of this information in the volume enables researchers and local government bodies to access a uniquely calculated unit cost saving them time and money. Some searches provide unit costs for a single service, e.g. telephone triage \(UCH&SC 2017\) and others provide multiple sources, such as our unit costs for various adoption services \(e.g. UCH&SC 2016\). Other searches provide ‘extra’ data for example on the receipt of external services such as nursing and therapy in residential and nursing homes \(UCH&SC 2018\). We interrogate any published papers for quality, provide any references in the schema and keep in contact with authors when using their data.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Informing Government policy and practice** 

 As the UK Government stated in 2014, PSSRU UCH&SC ‘provides \[them with\] the most up\-to\-date unit costs for a wide range of health and social care services in England’ **\[a\]**. Working directly with the DHSC, Department of Education \(DfE\), NICE, and a range of other key stakeholders, the UCH&SC team annually develops, improves, and publishes unit costs that are central to service provision across the country **\[R1\]**. These costs are then utilised by Government, and their departments/bodies, in four ways: 

1.  **Legislation impact assessments** 

 Each piece of legislation put forward by Government requires a supporting ‘Impact Assessment’, covering crucial questions such as ‘Why is Government intervention necessary?’ and ‘What are the policy objectives and the intended effects? \(UK Government 2020\). The UCH&SC provides the proposer the vital data to detail their case in financial terms regarding legislation related to health and social care. Practical examples include, in **2014**, the UCH&SC being used in an impact assessment of the Revised Code of Practice: Mental Health Act 1983 legislation aimed at promoting ‘recovery and positive health outcomes’ for those subject to the Mental Health Act **\[b\]**. The UCH&SC was specifically used to make the case for ‘extra investment in creating additional capacity’ by detailing ‘the average cost of an inpatient bed day in mental health wards’ **\[b\]**. The legislation was successfully passed and formally published in 2015, and affects the lives and liberties of over 53,000 people annually detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 **\[c\]**. It is also one of the key pieces of legislation brought forward to address failures highlighted by the Winterbourne View Hospital scandal 2011 **\[b\]**. 

 In **2019**, the UCH&SC was used extensively to support the Mental Capacity \(Amendment\) Bill, designed to ‘improve care and treatment for people lacking capacity and to provide a system of authorisation and robust safeguards in a cost\-effective manner’ **\[c\]**. The amended bill, given Royal Assent in 2019, simplifies the legal framework so that it is accessible and clear to all affected parties. It also reduces costs, as well as anxiety for affected families, by moving the process away from costly and time\-consuming court processes and widening the scope for decisions to be taken by health and social care professionals. The impact assessment states: ‘\[PSSRU\] Unit Costs of Health and Social Care 2018 provides the best evidence in relation to unit labour input costs which feeds into the overall training costs calculations where relevant’ **\[c\]**. The UCH&SC was used specifically to estimate health and social care professionals’ time \(doctors, social workers, new Mental Capacity Professionals\) to facilitate the application of the new legislation. The legislation impacts on the lives of some 217,235 people affected by mental capacity applications in England annually **\[c\]**. 

 The UCH&SC is also used in the scrutinising of legislation before it is passed. Examples include the Secretary of State for Health directly referencing the UCH&SC to answer questions from MPs on the costs of walk\-in emergency visits in 2014, and on the costs of training GPs in 2017 **\[d\].** 

1.  **Developing clinical guidelines and assessing new medical interventions** 

 UCH&SC is recommended for use in the NICE guidelines 2014 **\[e\]**. These overarching guidelines govern the development of specific guidelines affecting ‘clinical, public health and social care’ practice across England **\[e\]**. As NICE states: ‘without \[the UCH&SC\] NICE would not be able to make informed decisions on the cost\-effectiveness of many health interventions’ **\[f\]**.  Contextualised examples of this wide\-ranging impact include the UCH&SC being used by NICE in six Medtech innovation briefings \(MIBs\) regarding new health interventions **\[g\]**. The briefings inform the decision\-making of NHS and social care commissioners and staff who are considering using new medical devices and other medical or diagnostic technologies. The UCH&SC is used to determine application costs such as the time of medical professionals to administer the new treatments. As NICE puts it, the UCH&SC provides ‘vital inputs to \[…\] the potential resource impact of implementing NICE guidance’ **\[f\]** *.  Thus, UCH&SC informs critical clinical decision\-making in the context of overall service provision affecting commissioners, health and social care professionals, and millions of patients across the country. 

1.  **Health and social care policy development** 

 UCH&SC is used to develop UK health and social care policy. The DHSC has confirmed that it uses UCH&SE extensively, detailing a range of practical policy development applications. These include, in mental health policy, ‘modelling cost estimates for providing mental health services for people referred from Liaison and Diversion Services into MH services. This fed into the health economic estimates for the Final Business \(FBC\) to Liaison & Diversion, which asked Treasury for funding to roll out this service from 53% coverage of the England population to all the England population. The analytical work contributed significantly to the FBC’s approval by DH Finance and consequent ministerial approval’ \[h\]**. In pharmacy policy, UCH&SE is used ‘when sending out submissions for the prescription charge uplift. E.g. the income gained from increasing prescription charges by £xm would pay for y nurses salaries, z doctors salaries’ **\[h\]**. In social care policy, UCH&SC is used to demonstrate for Ministers and the Treasury ‘what additional funding might buy – e.g. beds in a residential care home for 100 older people’, and is currently being used to develop the Government’s Continuing Health Care policy, providing ‘estimates of costs and savings from making changes to a range of different elements of policy’ **\[h\]**. The DHSC also states that UCH&SE is used in the development of learning disability policy, to provide the briefs for Prime Minister’s Questions, and is used ‘frequently’ with regard to public health policy by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation **\[h\]**. Beyond direct use by the DHSC, UCH&SC has also been cited by both the 2016 Prime Minister’s Challenge Fund **\[i\]** and the 2017 National Audit Office assessment **\[i\]** of the policy to extend access to GP services, affecting ‘42,000 doctors employed in some 7,600 general practices in England’ and a total general practice spend of £9.5 billion \[i\]**. 

1.  **Commissioning of services** 

 UCH&SC is also utilised by Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\) to determine which services to commission and the extent of funding required. In 2015, it was used extensively in the Access and Waiting Time Standard for Children and Young People with an Eating Disorder Commissioning Guide to assess the staff costs and overheads required for services commissioned ‘to ensure that by 2020/21, 95 per cent of children and young people in need begin treatment within 1 week for urgent cases and 4 weeks for non\-urgent cases’ \[j\]**. Also in 2015, UCH&SE was used in the Models of Dementia Assessment and Diagnosis to support the detailed review of ‘three models of dementia assessment and diagnosis currently being used in dementia care in the NHS in England’, providing data on the ‘indicative costs for each model’ **\[k\]**. It is used by CCGs to review their local dementia care services with the ‘aim to making improvements’ in care **\[k\]**. As the review sets out, such detailed analysis of dementia service provision is vital, owing to ‘the enormous impact \[dementia has\] on our society today. Recent figures from the Alzheimer’s Society putting the number of people with dementia at 700,000\+ in England, 835,000 in the UK in total at a cost of £26 billion’ **\[k\]**. UCH&SC has also been used in the ongoing development and application of Social Impact Bonds \(SIBs\), an innovative way to fund public sector services whereby private investment is used, and only paid back by commissioners based on outcomes. UCH&SC enables local partnerships to estimate the fiscal, economic, and public benefits that may arise from SIB proposals and is cited on the Government SIBS website \(see ‘Guidance on developing a Social Impact Bond’ \[ **l**\] and report on ‘Supporting public service transformation’ **\[l\]**\). ‘There now exist over 30 SIBs across the UK, supporting tens of thousands of beneficiaries in areas like youth unemployment, mental health and homelessness’ **\[l\]**. 

 PSSRU’s UCH&SC achieves impacts at many levels, from Secretary of State to CCG, and across a wide range of service contexts. The evidence presented in this case study can give only a selective indication of these impacts. In addition to the evidence presented above, the UCH&SC is used extensively by the Department of Education as a central source for cost information in children’s social care, by organisations representing service providers, such as the Autism Alliance, to negotiate appropriate funding levels with Government, and think tanks such as the Institute for Government and the Social Care Institute for Excellence in their economic assessments of services that also feed into policy development. The UCH&SC has also been used internationally, including in supporting the Mental Health Commission of Canada to develop an economic data book and construct a more comprehensive measure of nursing home costs using UCH&SC ‘as a model’ **\[m\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 *Reassembled, Slightly Askew* \(RSA\) is an immersive audio\-theatre piece developed during a 5\-year period of collaborative artistic research, which has reached audiences in Canada, England, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and the USA through public performances, medical training sessions and high\-profile media coverage. RSA has significantly enhanced public awareness of the challenges of living with acquired brain injury \(ABI\) in all 6 countries. The work has also impacted the professional practices of artists and healthcare workers by harnessing the wider potential of immersive audio storytelling to provide empathetic and embodied understandings of invisible disabilities, and by offering medical professionals a deeper understanding of the patient experience in situations where this is difficult or dangerous to access directly \(i.e. coma, hemiparesis\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 RSA **\(r1\)** is based on an autobiographical account of Shannon Yee’s experience of falling critically ill with a rare brain infection and her journey of rehabilitation with an acquired brain injury \(ABI\). The project was initiated by Yee in 2010, and initially brought together a team of five lead artists: Yee \(writer, producer, actor\), Paul Stapleton \(sound designer, music composer\), Anna Newell \(theatre director\), Hanna Slättne \(dramaturg\), and Stevie Prickett \(choreographer\), who were later joined by sound artist Matilde Meireles \(project support\). Rather than develop a conventional play to be performed onstage to an audience at a distance, the aim was to create a more visceral encounter with Yee’s experience informed by Yee's hypersensitivity to sound resulting from her ABI, as well as her movement constraints from temporary paralysis down the left side of her body. 

 The inclusion of Stapleton on the artistic team provided underpinning research expertise in the development of novel sonic materials **\(r2\)** and the creative use of immersive sound technologies **\(r3\)**, as well as access to the state\-of\-the\-art facilities of the Sonic Arts Research Centre \(SARC\) at Queen’s University Belfast where much of the research and development phases of RSA took place \(2010\-2015\). The type of embodied listening employed in RSA, where sound playback is externalised in all directions rather than perceived as a simple left/right stereo image, was in part afforded by the use of binaural microphones and other sound technologies \(e.g. SARC's Sonic Lab loudspeaker array\). The project's creative use and adaptation of spatial audio technologies was directly informed by Stapleton's past artistic research in this area **\(r3\)**. 

 A significant part of the early stages of the research for RSA \(2010\-2012\) was focused on developing an interdisciplinary language that would allow the artistic team to move beyond the conventional forms of audio\-based dramatic narratives \(e.g. radio drama\), as well as musical forms that are typically more concerned with sound spatialisation than storytelling \(e.g. electroacoustic composition\). Stapleton's underpinning research in the areas of improvisation **\(r2\)** and interdisciplinary practice\-as\-research **\(r4\)** aided this stage of the process by providing methods for questioning disciplinary norms and extending existing sound recording techniques. In addition to conventional scripts, the artistic team made extensive use of graphic scoring techniques to aid in the structuring of the dramatic narrative. The resulting immersive audio\-theatre work consisted of processed dialogue performed by actors, reconstructed and newly imagined acoustic environments, spatial music compositions, and the sonic simulation of physical interactions, all of which were directly informed by Stapleton's previous body of research. 

 In 2013, following a successful Wellcome Trust 'small arts' public engagement fund bid \(£30k awarded to Yee\), the project team expanded to include medical practitioner advisors who were involved in Yee’s life\-saving surgeries and rehabilitation, including Roy McConnell \(consultant neurosurgeon\), Wendy Spence \(consultant neuropsychologist\) and Colin Williamson \(head injury liaison nurse\) at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. This phase of the research included multiple focus groups led by Yee with medical and health professionals, artists, and the general public to provide feedback on iterative drafts of the work. Significant time was spent by Stapleton reworking the sound design and compositional elements based on the project team's collective analysis of these focus group sessions. 

 In 2015, the completed version of RSA had its world premiere at The MAC in Belfast as part of the Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival. Audience members engage with RSA individually, listening via headphones while lying on a hospital bed, experiencing Yee’s descent into coma, brain surgeries, early days in the hospital, and re\-integration into the world with a hidden disability. This novel form of sonic storytelling placed the listener safely in the first\-person perspective with the aim of increasing empathy and understanding of Yee’s personal experience and of ABI more generally. This innovative approach to sonic storytelling was the primary contribution of the underpinning research. In recent years, a growing and widespread interest in the concept of immersion has been observable \(for example, in immersive theatre and VR\). However, prior to the development of RSA \(2010\-2015\), the design and dramaturgy of immersive theatrical experiences had generally prioritised the visual over the aural. The innovative qualities of RSA are evident in comments from critical reviewers at the time, including: 'uncategorisable art at its best’ \(Time Out London <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span>, A Nation’s Theatre Festival 2015\) and 'a completely different theatrical experience’ \(The Arts Review <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span>, Dublin Fringe Festival 2016\) **\(s2\)**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins> **Impact</ins> <ins>on Public Audiences**</ins> 

 Between 2015\-2019, RSA directly reached 2,546 people in Canada, England, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland at **25 different arts venues and festivals**, including: A Nation’s Theatre Festival, Battersea Arts Centre, London \(2016\); Dublin Fringe Festival \(2016\); High Performance Rodeo, Calgary \(2018\); “No Limits” Hong Kong Arts Festival \(2019\), and the Hong Kong Museum of Medical Sciences \(2019\). Individuals from this group attended the full 48\-minute performance version of the piece, experienced blindfolded wearing headphones while lying on a hospital bed in a makeshift ward attended by a nurse actor. Nearly all public performances were sold out. Indeed, several performances were significantly oversubscribed due in part to limited capacity; typically venues were able to accommodate only four to eight hospital beds and, therefore, four to eight audience members for any one performance. This necessitated multiple runs of the show at each location. In addition to first\-hand experiences of the complete work, the wider public was given the opportunity to engage with aspects of RSA through online and print materials including **national and international media coverage** **\(s2\),** such as: a four\-star review in The Guardian \(the UK's second most\-read online newspaper with an estimated monthly digital readership of 35.2 million\); a feature video as part of the BBC's 'Hull 2017 UK City of Culture' output; and an article in the Toronto Star \(a broadsheet newspaper with the highest overall weekly circulation in Canada and an estimated 5.8 million online monthly unique visitors\). 

 While the limited capacity of the show greatly restricted the total number which could experience RSA first\-hand, profound cross\-cultural impact on many audience members in all 5 countries was evident. As part of all RSA public performances \(from 2015\-2019\), each audience member was asked to remove their shoes and complete a demographic survey prior to being assisted into a hospital bed by a nurse actor. Following the end of each performance, audience members were given the option to complete the survey form by responding to: 'Any other comments or questions?'. Out of the **2,546 respondents**, **77% of respondents \(1,964\) took this opportunity to provide specific comments** **about their experience**, representing a very high level of engagement with the work **\(s1\)**. 94% \(1,847\) of those who commented enjoyed the performance and/or gave positive feedback. Such responses were mirrored in several very positive critical reviews, for example: 'Paul Stapleton’s echoing 360\-degree soundscape invades and inspires the imagination \[...\] A real\-life ordeal, captured by a daring, disorientating artistic collaboration \[...\] It should be available on prescription' \(The Stage <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span>\) **\(s2\)**. 

 **Beyond enjoyment, many of the open comments from the audience survey provide rich descriptions of intellectual, emotional and/or physical impact.** Emotional and sensory impacts were among the most common responses \(684\). For example, one male audience member from Ireland commented: 'I found the whole experience to be incredibly emotive. The inner voice of the protagonist really immersed me in her character even to the point of giving the illusion of different personhood. I was brought to tears \(well, almost, on the cusp\) on several occasions, really experiencing and sharing the fear, anger, sadness and joy…and also the love between the protagonist and her partner.' A woman from the north west of England explained the extent to which she had experienced the sensation of ABI during the performance: 'It was very powerful. Now, as I write this I am thinking “I can remember how to write\!”. As I put my shoes on, got out of bed and made steps, took a glass of water – I felt like I too was remembering how to do this. I wasn’t taking any of these things / functions for granted. I felt I was you truly.' Similar intense sensorial responses were reflected in the critical media reviews: ‘Paul Stapleton’s powerful sound design sets sparks through your ears as Shannon’s brain fills with abscesses' \(Time Out London <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span>\). In Hong Kong, where English was not the first language of most audience members, emotional and/or sensory impact was still evident in many of the responses; 52 of the 257 comments received from respondents in Hong Kong mentioned this type of impact. Examples include: 'an extraordinary experience which I even cried during the show. It felt so real and personal' \(female\), and, 'it was so “real” \[...\] Although I am not understanding the whole injury as I am not familiar with English narrator, I can taste a little part of \[Yee's\] journey' \(male\). 

 Another common theme in the data from the open audience survey question was **the strong sense of being immersed**. The word 'immersive' was used 227 times \(together with the closely related terms ‘submersive’, ‘transporting’, ‘involving’, ‘engrossing’, ‘experiential’ and ‘sensory’\). Indicative examples include, 'Brilliantly immersive. I was completely lost in the piece, absolutely carried away in it. A lot of food for thought' \(male, London\), and, 'I am stunned. Actually at a loss for words. Wanting to go through it again. Totally immersive. Never thought sound could be used this way' \(male, Vancouver\). While immersive audio technologies and techniques have been around for many decades, the specific application of such resources in the context of theatre is still in its infancy. Audiences commented on **the uniqueness of the immersive experience**: '\[RSA\] was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Never have I felt so immersed in another consciousness' \(female, Calgary\); and, 'The binaural recording helped with immersion like I’ve never heard before' \(female, Vancouver\). Some survey respondents made positive comparisons between RSA and their experiences of related subject matters in other artistic contexts: 'Much more effective than films I’ve seen about a similar subject \(the butterfly and the diving bell, the sea inside\)' \(female, Belfast\); and, 'I’ve read novels and seen movies that tackle similar material, but they didn’t come close to this experience. I felt fear, pain, love and hope' \(female, Hong Kong\). It is clear that being immersed in Yee’s story was a critical condition for audience members to be able to experience some of the other emotional and intellectual impacts of RSA. 

 Many responses to the open audience survey question provide clear evidence that **RSA contributed to public understanding of ABI in all 5 countries** \(471\), with 141 respondents indicating without prompt that they could now better empathise with those experiencing ABI and/or related conditions. The demographic data collected in the survey indicates that this increased understanding extended to audience members with personal experiences of those who had an ABI as well as those with no prior experience. Indicative examples include: 'I have a friend who went through a brain surgery recently and this show gave me some insight into what she must have felt like' \(male, Toronto\); 'I have a very close similar case, it was around 6 years and it happened to my mum. Now I can understand better how it was for her' \(male, London\); 'Having experienced a brain injury, thankfully less extreme, but similar. I want to thank you for sharing your story. It was both familiar and enlightening \(female, Surrey\); 'As a person who has \(thankfully\) never been in a hospital bed in my life your story definitely gave me better perspective of what it feels like having a brain\-related illness/injury. Definitely something medical personnel should experience through their training as well for empathy training\!' \(male, Hong Kong\). This beneficial impact was also echoed by critical reviewers: ‘When a doctor asks her if she knows where she is, I had to suppress the urge to shout: “In hell.” That makes the show sound gruelling. It is, but it is also uplifting and empathetic’ \(The Guardian <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span>\); ‘The result is a disorientating experience, meticulously assembled by Yee, director Anna Newell and a team including sound designer Paul Stapleton. Together they have crafted a richly textured three\-dimensional soundscape that affords us a profound and moving sense of what it might be like to have a brain injury — and recover from one’ \(Evening Standard <span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span><span style=""font-family: Symbol"">&#xF02A;</span>\); ‘This show will be of supreme interest to audiophiles, radio producers, medical sociologists and anthropologists, doctors and nurses – or in fact anyone looking to understand and form an empathetic bond with an acquired brain injury patient’ \(NOW Toronto\) **\(s2\)**. 

 <ins> **Impact on Professional Practice**</ins> 

 Impact on public awareness also extended to an **enhanced professional understanding of ABI among those working in a number of relevant professions**. Evidence of this type of impact started to emerge during the making of RSA. Roy McConnell, a Consultant Neurosurgeon at Royal Victoria Hospital who was responsible for the lifesaving treatment of Yee, later became a biomedical advisor on the RSA project. McConnell comments on the impact this artwork had on his practice in a 2015 interview on YouTube: 'Using the arts as an effective tool in healthcare is a concept I hadn't really explored much before *Reassembled*. If I'm being honest, I viewed it as being on the fringe of what we do \[...\] However, as I got more involved with the project I realised the ability of it to effect how we think about our patients \[...\] it is really a very powerful education tool for people who have not been in that situation to help them gain empathy with their patients' **\(s3\)**. The potential for wider impact on healthcare practice identified by McConnell was realised during the international touring of RSA. 

 Audience survey data from 2015\-2019 **\(s1\)** indicates that **384 relevant professionals** \(i.e. 'medical / healthcare professionals' and 'brain injury support organization staff'\) from all 5 countries experienced RSA in public performance settings. **82% of these respondents \(315\) provided specific comments** to the open question at the end of the survey, out of which 96% enjoyed the performance and/or gave positive feedback. Beyond enjoyment, emergent themes in the open comments from this demographic include one or more of the following: gained understanding and/or insight into the experience of ABI \(90\); believe they can now better empathise with those experiencing ABI \(39\); intention to make use of their learning from RSA in their own professional work \(40\); believes RSA would form the basis of a helpful professional training tool \(63\). Indicative comments include: 'A truly impactful piece, immersive, empathetic and empowering. As a medical student I very much see the potential for this to serve as a learning tool and an opportunity to refresh my empathy \(male, Dublin\); 'As a nurse in a neuro ICU I found this extremely insightful. It’s very hard to understand let alone have any idea what these patients experience' \(female, Toronto\). 

 As a result of growing interest from the healthcare community, RSA has also been presented at The Society of British Neurosurgeons Conference in York \(September 2015\), in various focus groups and medical training session in Northern Ireland \(for example, the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast Trust\), and in **a** **medical training session for 160 employees in the rehabilitation department at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York**, one of the most highly\-acclaimed teaching hospitals in the United States \(October 2017\). The latter received coverage in **The Wall Street Journal \(s2\)** in a feature article citing medical professionals at Mount Sinai whose practice was impacted by the experience of RSA, including paediatric critical care doctor Steven Yung: ‘We have to keep personalizing the patient \[…\] And we’re taught that and know that but to experience that is completely different’; and, senior occupational therapist Andrea Johnston who helped facilitate the session: 'I now have a visceral memory that I will carry with me \[…\] I will try to remember every time I pass that threshold into a patient’s room. I really, I feel it in me, I feel differently in the unit.' 

 **RSA has also impacted on artistic practice**. An indicator of this type of impact is found in the use of RSA as a primary reference point for the makers of the BBC Radio 4 documentary ‘Dwelling, A House With Two Rooms’, broadcast in November 2018. The programme focused on the experiences of a teenage girl with autism spectrum disorder. The BBC’s programme details state, 'Inspired by an innovative, immersive theatre experience called Reassembled Slightly Askew, which was based on the artist Shannon Sickels' \[aka Yee\] experience of a serious brain infection, Marie Louise \[Muir \- radio broadcaster\] and Catherine wonder if they can use immersive sound technologies to give audiences a better understanding of autism' **\(s4\)**. Interviews and sound demonstrations with Stapleton and Yee are included in the documentary. Impact in this area also extends to the RSA artistic team, including the professional practice of the project's autobiographical author and producer who states, 'It’s been a great privilege to work with Paul throughout the inception, creation and continued life of \[RSA\] \[...\] Collaborating with Paul affected the way in which I conceived and communicated the script, and has enhanced my writing process ever since' **\(s5\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The longstanding partnership agreement between the European Union \(EU\) and the Organisation of 79 states in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific \(OACPS\) covers a wide array of policies \(e.g. economic development, environmental sustainability, security and migration\). The renewal of the agreement was impeded by the conflicting preferences of EU Member States and the differentiated needs and priorities of the three OACP regions. Carbone’s research contributed to brokering EU\-OACP relations by: \(1\) setting the parameters for an unprecedented multi\-level cooperation framework to enhance policy coherence and coordination; \(2\) supporting the negotiating positions of both the EU and the OACPS, leading to a political deal on the agreement in December 2020. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

###   

 This Impact Case Study is underpinned by research carried out by Maurizio Carbone, Professor of International Relations and Development and Jean Monnet Chair of EU External Policies, at the UofG since September 2005. Carbone’s research on the relations between the EU and ACP states has been externally funded by three grants awarded by the Jean Monnet Programme of the European Commission **\[G1, G2, G3\]**. 

 **2.1. Exposing the structural limitations of the Cotonou Agreement** 

 The Cotonou Agreement, which succeeded the Lomé Convention \(1975–2000\), has been governing relations between the European Union and the ACP States \(renamed the Organisation of ACP States in April 2020\) since June 2000. Considered the most comprehensive framework for North\-South relations, the EU\-OACPS partnership encompasses numerous policy areas—most notably development, trade, migration and mobility, peace and security, democracy and human rights, environment and climate change—affecting the lives of more than a billion people, whose annual per\-capita income ranges from USD261 \(Burundi\) to USD32,993 \(Bahamas\). 

 Carbone’s research over more than a decade has revealed how the existing format for cooperation between the two blocs, consisting of a single model applicable indistinctly to all ACP states, has failed to take account of diverse needs and priorities across the three ACP regions **\[3.5\]**. The limitations of the EU\-OACPS institutional architecture, Carbone’s research has demonstrated, have been further exposed by the adoption of other frameworks for cooperation between the EU and different clusters of ACP states, for instance the EU and the African Union, or the EU and other regional and sub\-regional organisations **\[3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]**. Carbone’s research has also revealed how the EU and ACP states have largely failed to join forces in the international arena to support shared values, such as multilateralism and sustainable development, with the notable exception of the Paris Agreement on climate change **\[3.1, 3.5\]**. Furthermore, through different strands of his research portfolio, Carbone has unravelled various forces underpinning the enduring asymmetrical relations between the EU and ACP states and has called for a profound rethinking of the donor\-recipient dynamics that have permeated the EU\-OACPS partnership over the past decades **\[3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\]**. 

 **2.2. Showing the need for enhanced policy coherence** 

 While dismantling the EU\-OACPS partnership in its entirety has been advocated by various EU Member States \(e.g. Germany, the Netherlands, and the Nordic countries\) and even several divisions within the EU institutions **\[3.1, 3.5\]**, Carbone’s research has highlighted the necessity and benefit of preserving some aspects of it, particularly to ensure coherence with decisions taken in policy areas other than development—notably trade, environment and foreign and security policy **\[3.1\]**. The analysis of interlinkages between different policy areas, often not in a very synergetic fashion, has been at the heart of Carbone’s research since he pioneered the notion of policy coherence for development \(PCD\) in the late 2000s **\[3.3\]**. 

 Over the past two decades, Professor Carbone has unveiled various problems related to lack of policy coherence in the EU’s external action, particularly with regard to the security\-development nexus **\[3.4\]**, the link between development cooperation and agriculture and fisheries policies **\[3.3\]**, or the promotion of human rights and democracy **\[3.6\]** *.  Furthermore, he has identified specific mechanisms to advance PCD, including in EU\-ACP relations **\[3.3, 3.5\]**. Finally, based on research trips to around 20 ACP countries, he has pointed to the negative effects of the increased securitisation of EU foreign aid for the promotion of human and social development and has singled out the costs and benefits of improved EU aid coordination and joint programming in developing countries, particularly in Africa and the Pacific **\[3.2, 3.4, 3.6\]** *.*

###  4. Details of the impact 

###   

 From 2013 onwards, Carbone’s research on the EU’s external action and the evolution of EU\-OACPS relations has had a significant impact on the negotiations for the successor to the Cotonou Agreement. This impact has been generated through publications, stakeholder presentations, and formal and informal advice to policymakers, with different actors in the EU and the OACPS as the direct beneficiaries, and people across 117 countries as indirect beneficiaries. 

 **4.1. Setting the agenda on the post\-Cotonou Agreement** 

 The impact of Carbone’s research on the EU\-OACPS negotiations can be traced back to a special section of the *Journal of International Development* \(JID\), which he guest\-edited in 2013 with contributions from the then heads of the taskforces on future EU\-ACP relations of both the EU and the OACPS. In his introduction to the JID special section, Carbone drew on his research to highlight strengths and weaknesses of the Cotonou Agreement and identified different scenarios for future EU\-ACP relations. Carbone’s research findings, widely circulated in EU\-ACP policy circles in Brussels, *“played an important role in setting the agenda on ACP\-EU relations after the expiration of the Cotonou Agreement”,* as confirmed by the OACPS Secretary General \(statement **\[5A\]**\). 

 **4.2. Developing an unprecedented multi\-level format for EU\-ACP relations** 

 In December 2015, Carbone was invited to serve as a policy advisor to the EU Taskforce on the Post\-Cotonou. Drawing on the findings of his research, an impact assessment was designed to ascertain the feasibility of different scenarios. The proposed legal framework, in the form of an unprecedented model in the history of the EU's engagement with third countries, retained a general part applicable to all ACP countries, including a novel section on international cooperation. Most importantly, it introduced the idea of three separate regional pillars, which allowed for the targeting of specific policy actions to different countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. This innovative multi\-level framework was endorsed and incorporated into the proposal for the EU’s negotiating directives adopted by the European Commission \(EC\) in December 2017 *.* The EU Chief Negotiator acknowledged the impact of Carbone’s *“research and specific inputs on the institutional framework and other important aspects of the EU\-ACP partnership related to development cooperation, and the links between development, trade and security \[which\] have played an important role in all phases leading the EU Negotiating Directives”* \(confirmed by statement **\[5B\]**\). 

 **4.3. Supporting the new approach with the EU and with the ACP Group** 

 Carbone’s research contributed to and affected the EU negotiating directives, which must be approved by the EU Council of Ministers before the EC can engage in negotiations with third parties \(confirmed by statement **\[5C\]**\) *.* In September 2017, Carbone presented his research findings in a restricted meeting with senior officials of EU Member States, leading to the eventual acceptance of the new approach resting on two\-interlinked components, with some provisions applying to the whole ACP Group and other targeted to countries in the three ACP regions, and a stronger emphasis on coherence between different policy areas beyond development cooperation only. In the first semester of 2018, working closely with the Bulgarian Presidency of the EU, he provided substantial inputs and, *“made a tangible impact on some of the provisions covered in the EU Negotiating Directives”,  particularly on issues related to policy coherence for development and aid effectiveness, as acknowledged by the Chair of the ACP Working Party of the EU Council **\[5C\]** *.* 

 Carbone’s research, furthermore, ‘ *informed several discussions within the ACP Group on the institutional architecture of the new ACP\-EU Agreement’,* as confirmed by the OACPS Secretary General **\[5A\]**. In March 2016, Carbone presented his research before the ACP Committee of Ambassadors and in May 2018 delivered a keynote address in the context of the ACP Council of Ministers in Togo \(confirmed by letter of invitation **\[5D\]**\). In both venues, he drew on his research findings to support the shift in decision\-making and implementation of strategic priorities towards the regional level and indicated how to best involve regional organisations, including the African Union, into the future EU\-OACP Agreement \(as confirmed by letter **\[5E\]**\) *.* The OACPS Secretary General testifies to the importance of Carbone’s research, whose *“insightful recommendations were included in the outcome document and ... had a significant impact on the preparatory process leading to the adoption of the ACP Negotiating Mandate by the ACP Council of Ministers”* **\[5A\]** *.* 

 Carbone’s research also had an impact on the position of the European Parliament \(EP\) and the Joint EU\-ACP Parliamentary Assembly. In particular, in March 2018 he gave oral evidence before the EP Development Committee, and in December 2018, was keynote speaker before approximately 150 EU and ACP parliamentarians. In both settings, he documented the shortcomings of the legal framework governing the EU\-ACP partnership and suggested concrete ways for ‘how to partner with regional organisations and to develop a real multi\-actor partnership’ \(confirmed by letter **\[5E\]** and programme **\[5F\]**\). This adds to the workshop for EP Members, which Carbone organised and led in February 2016 on the promotion of policy coherence for development in EU external relations, particularly in ACP countries \(confirmed by EU workshop report **\[5G\]**\). The resolution of the EP, recommending specific mechanisms to operationalise policy coherence for development, including on joint programming, shows that Carbone’s recommendations were taken on board \(confirmed by resolution report **\[5H\]**\). 

 **4.4. A political deal for a new Partnership Agreement** 

 On 3 December 2020, the chief negotiators from the EU and OACPS reached a political deal on the text for a new Partnership Agreement that will succeed the Cotonou Agreement \(confirmed by press release **\[5I\]**\). The EU Chief Negotiator said, *‘\[The\] deal marks a step towards a new era for the EU, Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. People in all those four regions of the world will benefit from this ambitious Agreement.’* The OACPS Chief Negotiator confirmed that, *‘The political agreement \[…\] paves the way for a modern and more committed partnership at the national, regional and international levels.’* **\[5I\]**. A senior EU official added, *‘There is a real shift in the structure of the agreement,’* pointing to the ‘3\+1’ composition of the new deal, composed of a common foundation to all countries, which sets out shared values and priorities, along with three regional protocols for Africa, the Caribbean, and Pacific \(confirmed by article **\[5J\]**\). 

 Now that a political deal has been reached, the text will go through internal procedures before the finalisation of the agreement at a later stage in 2021.

### 1.  Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a novel detection technique, known as Mass Photometry, which is capable of weighing molecules with light. It enables the accurate mass measurement of proteins and other molecules in solution, in their native state and without the need for labels – a simple yet powerful capability that is useful across the life sciences, in research and in industry. In June 2018, the University of Oxford spin\-out company Refeyn was formed to commercialise the research. Following formation, Refeyn **\[text removed for publication\]** has since sold and installed **\[text removed for publication\]** of its first generation Refeyn OneMP mass photometers to pharma companies, research laboratories and facilities worldwide, accelerating and enabling new science for working with and studying biomolecules in both the academic and pharmaceutical space. **\[Text removed for publication\]**

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professors Philipp Kukura and Justin Benesch from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oxford have pioneered a new technique known as Mass Photometry \(MP\). MP relies on the accurate determination of scattering contrast for single molecules as they approach a refractive index interface, for example between a solution and a glass slide. The scattering contrast of biomolecules is closely related to its mass and therefore simply by imaging a molecule as it binds to a microscope slide, the mass can be accurately calculated \[ **R1**\]. 

 This discovery follows a significant period of foundational research. Professor Kukura’s group has been working the related technique, interferometric scattering microscopy \(iSCAT\), for more than 10 years. The group had previously shown the utility of iSCAT for studying molecular motors, such as Myosin 5a \[ **R2**\]. Arguably, the group’s most important breakthrough was the 2014 demonstration that iSCAT is sufficiently sensitive to detect and image individual proteins without any labels \[ **R3**\]. Additional advances in detection sensitivity by an order of magnitude \[ **R4**\] led to the further demonstration that light scattering can be used not only to visualise single molecules, which has intrinsic advantages over ensemble\-based methods, but also – by careful quantification of the detected signals – to measure their mass with high accuracy, precision, resolution, sensitivity and dynamic range \[ **R1**\]. 

 In recognition of its potential to become an indispensable tool for researchers working across the life sciences, two grants were awarded to further develop the technology and bring it to market: an EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account award \(2017\) and an ERC Proof of Concept Award \(2018\). 

 In Professor Benesch’s group, research over the previous decade focussed on developing, enhancing and demonstrating the value of measurements of mass and mass distributions for quantitatively characterising biomolecules and their interactions. In the growing field of native mass spectrometry \(MS\), his group has led efforts to bring both the experimental approach and its analysis onto a quantitative footing. Advances made by the group have been key in driving mass measurement to the forefront of biophysical investigation, showing that it is the best way to quantify the assembly states of biomolecules and the strengths of their interactions. This work is paving the way to a new era of molecular biology understanding, grounded in the fundamental quantities of physical chemistry \[ **R5**\]. 

 The success and potential of MP comes from the confluence of advances in the Kukura and Benesch groups: the Kukura group’s development of a fundamentally new method of measuring mass and the Benesch group’s work advancing mass itself as a valuable measure for the life sciences.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Pathway to impact: from research to commercialisation 

 The research and development of mass photometry \(MP\) in Kukura and Benesch’s research groups attracted attention after publication in Science in 2018 \[ **R1, E1**\- **2**\]. The combination of experimental power and feasibility led many academic institutions and commercial enterprises to express an interest in obtaining the technology to analyse their own samples. In the 18 months following publication of MP, an enormous variety of samples and scientific questions were brought to the Kukura lab by more than 30 international collaborators from a variety of scientific backgrounds. The interests of these groups ranged from developing and interrogating antibody\-based pharmaceuticals to the manufacture and quality control of inorganic nanoparticles. 

 Throughout MP’s development, the researchers worked closely with Oxford University Innovation \(OUI\), the technology transfer company for the University of Oxford, to protect the new IP being developed. Recognising the potential impact of this technology, OUI filed 2 patents, with one covering the key aspects of the MP device, *Interferometric scattering microscopy* \[ **E3**\], and another a key implementation of the technology, *Method of determining lipoprotein concentration in solution using light scattering* \[ **E4**\]. The former has been granted in the US and in Europe. 

 OUI and the academic team identified the formation of a spin\-out company as the most appropriate route to maximise the impact from this platform technology. In June 2018, University of Oxford spin\-out company Refeyn \(initially known as Arago Biosciences\) successfully raised **\[text removed for publication\]** from several sources, including Oxford Sciences Innovation, to further develop the technology and make it widely available as an instrument accessible to non\-expert users. Within months, the company had made its first sales to academic institutions and continued to expand the capabilities of the microscope. The founding of the company was extremely rapid: an EPSRC IAA award in October 2017 enabled construction of a first commercial prototype, which was presented at an international conference in February 2018, 2 months before the original manuscript was published, which in turn was 4 months before Refeyn was founded. \[ **E5**\] 

 Following a highly successful first 8 months in operation, Refeyn raised a further **\[text removed for publication\]** led by Foresight Williams and Oxford Sciences Innovation with the aim of expanding its development pipeline and scaling up production of its existing product, the Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup>. Subsequently, Refeyn raised another **\[text removed for publication\]** during the COVID\-19 pandemic, led by high profile US investors Northpond Ventures \[ **E5**\]. 

###  Innovative new technology 

 The ability to observe the often\-subtle interactions between proteins is crucial for studying the processes that underpin life itself. Only through a deep understanding of these processes can we begin to develop the next generation of biopharmaceuticals to tackle previously untreatable diseases. The MP approach ‘weighs molecules with light’, providing immediate insight into the state of proteins and other molecules. 

 In mass photometry, the light scattered by a molecule attached to the measurement interface interferes with light reflected at that interface. The interference scales linearly with object mass. The Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> detects this scattered light, using the signal to count molecules and measure their mass. This is possible in a wide range of native buffer solutions, without the need for labels. 


 Figure 1. Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> benchtop mass photometry device \(above\). 

 Figure 2. The principle of mass photometry \(right\). 






 The Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> featured in The Scientist’s \(a professional magazine for life scientists\) Top 10 Innovations of 2019. The Boris Magasanik Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology **\[text removed for publication\]** was quoted as saying “ *The most valuable thing with this instrument is that we can look at complex proteins\-macromolecular complexes and figure out what are the components in that mixture, and do we detect any issue with stability. It’s a very time\-consuming process in typical workflow*.” \[ **E6**\] 

 In 2019 Refeyn went on to win the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Emerging Technologies Competition Award and an R&D 100 award in the analytical/test category \[ **E11**\]. 

###  Commercial sales and use 

 **\[Text removed for publication\]** 

 The instruments are being used across vaccine development, cell and gene therapy production, Quality Assurance/Quality Control of biologics, and next generation drug discovery \[ **E5**\]. More than 20 academic publications have explicitly used the instrument in the broader and more specific bioanalytical context \[ **E7**\]. For example, AstraZeneca have used Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> in COVID\-19 research to study the spike protein of the SARS\-CoV\-2 virus and its interaction with the ACE2 receptor \[ **E8**\], and for drug discovery to explore the characterization of star polymers for future biophysical targeting of tumours \[ **E9**\]. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health \(USA\) used MP to measure the affinity of protein\-protein interactions on a single\-molecule level, concluding ‘ *The quality and information content of the MP data, combined with simple and fast measurements and low sample consumption makes MP a new preferred method for measuring strong protein\-protein interactions*.’ \[ **E10**\] 

 In just 2 years the uptake and variety of uses seen across the scientific community show that mass photometry is a transformative technology enabling a new way to analyze molecules. It has opened up new possibilities for bioanalytics and research into the functions of biomolecules across the life sciences.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 
In 2014, the centenary of World War One \(WW1\) presented a significant challenge for heritage bodies and communities across the UK and Ireland, as well as a great opportunity on how to commemorate past conflict *inclusively*. Led by historical geographers at Queen’s University Belfast \(QUB\), an AHRC\-funded WW1 Engagement Centre—“Living Legacies 1914\-18”—partnered with communities and institutions nationally and internationally to co\-produce research sharing untold experiences of war, so enhancing inclusive cross\-community understanding of contested heritage. Over six years, Living Legacies developed spatial and digital humanities tools and methods to deliver a public engagement programme that supported 120 community centenary projects in Britain and Ireland, reached 16,225 event participants, and 210,000\+ exhibition visitors, as well as leveraging c.£900k for community coproduction projects between 2014\-19, delivering significant policy\-recognised benefits and impacts in the UK and Ireland. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2013, “a  [major call](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20200923114229/https://ahrc.ukri.org/newsevents/news/worldwaroneengagementcentres/) was issued by the AHRC for proposals from consortia of research organisations to support and encourage the extensive interest in exploring WW1 and its legacy among communities in the UK.” In 2014, a successful bid led by Lilley and Ell created the ‘Living Legacies 1914\-18’ WW1 Engagement Centre \(EC\), founded on their long track\-record of published and funded research at QUB on digital and spatial humanities in historical geography, coupled with Lilley’s established impact projects in cultural heritage. 

 With its historical\-geographical grounding, combined with an interdisciplinary approach, Living Legacies engagement was underpinned by a strong *spatial* emphasis and community coproduction projects, as well as a strong sensitivity to the importance of *place* and *landscape* in constructing and conveying cultural and social *identities*. Both drew directly on the geographical research of Lilley and Ell. To this end, **as an AHRC WW1 engagement centre <ins>only</ins> Living Legacies was directly underpinned by geographical research,** drawing on geospatial and digital techniques and methodologies which give new grounding and provide new spaces for engagement around contested heritage. 

 Key research that directly shaped and guided the creation, development and delivery of Living Legacies includes, <ins>first</ins>, Lilley’s **spatial humanities** research, particularly using geovisualisation, digital methodologies and geospatial technologies, especially mapping as an interpretative space for exploring alternative narratives about past places, as set out by Lilley and Dean \(2015\) **\[R1\]**. Since 2003, Lilley successfully developed these themes through a series of AHRC\-funded digital projects on **cultural heritage**, including *Mapping Medieval Chester* \(2008\-9\) and *City Witness* \(2012\-14\). Each of these major inter\-disciplinary research projects forged strong pathways to impact, through web\-GIS resources, map\-based exhibitions, historical walking trails, and geospatial datasets, reaching across heritage and community sectors \(e.g. medievalchester.ac.uk; medievalswansea.ac.uk/en/\) **\[R2\]**. In 2018, in recognition of his leading contribution to contemporary geographical research methods, including GIS and digital mapping, the Cuthbert Peek Award was conferred on Lilley by the Royal Geographical Society \(with IBG\). 

 A <ins>second</ins> critical area of underpinning research for Living Legacies is QUB expertise by Ell on **digital humanities**, GIS applications and historical gazetteers and datasets, including spatial analyses specifically relating Britain and Ireland’s social and historical geographies. **\[R3\]** This research drew on major collaborative projects including digitisation and ICT with government and public bodies UK and Ireland wide, through the  [Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis](https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforDataDigitisationandAnalysis/)  \(CDDA\) based in Geography at QUB. Founded in 1999 and directed by Ell, CDDA has consistently pioneered linkages between information technologies and humanities research internationally, and delivered major innovative digital projects such as *A Vision of Britain through time 1801\-2001* and *Digitising Scotland*. This research shows how GIS\-based analysis makes a clear contribution to our knowledge of historical geography, in particular how **historical GIS** can and is developing our knowledge of the past, and challenging orthodox historical explanations. **\[R3\]** Especially significant here is Ell’s research on exploring the spatial histories of social divides in Ireland using census data and GIS. **\[R4\]** 

 Through these interdisciplinary projects and outputs, Lilley and Ell’s combined experiences of GIS and geospatial applications in cultural heritage and digital engagements shaped and underpinned Living Legacies engagement and impacts across the Centenary period, directly enabling community researchers to co\-produce digital and geospatial resources and outputs, building their field\-/place\-based, mapping and landscape knowledge, skills and capacity on an inclusive cross\-community basis. This ‘connected communities’ approach was of critical importance to policy makers in the context of Living Legacies in Northern Ireland, using a contested centenary of a past conflict to bridge community divides, and lay at the heart of the research undertaken through the centre’s engagement programmes between 2014\-19. In 2019, these engagements were documented in a legacy web\-site created for *Living Legacies 1914\-18* \(http://www.livinglegacies1914\-18.ac.uk/\), and the *WW1 Community Platform*, archiving digital content and objects from NLHF and AHRC WW1 EC projects \(http://ww1digitalportal.org.uk/\), both web\-resources created by QUB Geography and CDDA and coordinated by Lilley and Ell. 

 Living Legacies drew upon both previous research and experiences gained through six years of engagement activities, and pro\-actively developed new methods and tools for exploring the contested heritage of WW1, forming a basis for further research outputs focusing on historical\-geographical approaches in community mapping and heritage engagement. **\[R5, R6\]**. This research arising *through* Living Legacies engagement has itself thus furthered geographical debates on ‘citizen cartography’, participatory GIS and ‘inclusive heritage’. This iterative research>impact>research process reflects the recursive nature of Living Legacies ‘engaged research’ between 2014 and 2020, drawing on previous research by Lilley for developing public engagement and participation programmes for the centre activities, and then feeding this *back* into an international research agenda through collaborative published outputs.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Over the period 2014\-19, a team of <ins>21</ins> <ins>‘Living Legacies’ EC researchers</ins> led by Lilley and Ell created a set of geographical and geospatial tools, methods and approaches to address community groups and projects needs and interests in commemorating the Centenary of WW1 in new and meaningful ways. Funded through the UKRI AHRC \(£1.7m\), Living Legacies centre researchers collaborated nationally and internationally across research, community, heritage and policy sectors, resulting in highly successful outcomes and impacts for the funder, the results and impacts of which were summarised by the AHRC’s 2020 policy report, “Relationship Brokering: Reflections on Community Engagement from AHRC’s World War One Engagement Centres”, and a series of linked stakeholder and policy events in 2019 around the UK **\[LL1\]**. 




 *Schematic diagram of ‘* [*Living Legacies 1914\-18*](http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/) *’ Engagement Centre collaborators, partners, networks and projects, leveraging c.£900k for community coproduction \(2014\-19\)* \[ **LL1**\] 


-  **Public engagement and community upskilling through digital and spatial humanities:** 

 Through <ins> **120**</ins> <ins>community</ins> <ins>projects</ins> and <ins> **470**</ins> <ins>supported</ins> <ins>events</ins>, and focusing on digitally exploring, visualising and recording the legacies of WW1 in localities and landscapes, Living Legacies community engagement \(archived at livinglegacies1914\-18.ac.uk\) resulted in significant **impacts for key UK agencies, bodies and organisations** leading WW1 Centenary programmes: 

1.  Living Legacies was established as part of a AHRC\-NLHF strategic partnership, created in 2014. Working collaboratively with community groups UK\-wide, our digital and place\-based projects and programmes impacted on the successful delivery and reach of the £94 million Heritage Lottery Fund \(now **National Lottery Heritage Fund**\) community centenary objectives creating 1,900 WW1 projects across the UK, within which NLHF commended how: 

 *“Living Legacies has been central to helping the National Lottery Heritage Fund <ins>achieve the aims of its strategic partnership</ins> with AHRC to support First World War Centenary projects to <ins>increase</ins> <ins>public understanding of the war</ins>…”*  **\[LL2\]** 

1.  A series of UK\-wide community\-based research and upskilling workshops on landscapes, web\-GIS and field\-survey were developed and delivered by Living Legacies as part of the **Council for British Archaeology’s** \(CBA\) major “Home Front Legacy” \(HFL\) Centenary crowdsourcing project, recording 5,660 WW1 heritage sites right across the UK in partnership with **Historic England** *,* with the result that: 

 *“The range of things we* \[CBA\] *could offer at the <ins>workshops increased because of collaborating with Living Legacies</ins> – we were able to give a <ins>much b</ins><ins>roader range of skills development</ins>… to develop projects… to provide advice on fieldwork*… *at sites, identifying sites and recording them – all of those skills can be taken on to be used in any area of heritage”.*  **\[LL3\]** 

1.  In 2018 for the major **RAF100** commemorative programme and working closely with the **Royal Air Force** in Northern Ireland, Living Legacies led and developed a digital, GIS\-based toolkit \(called “ [Action Stations\!](http://www.livinglegacies1914-18.ac.uk/Old-Site/www.qub.ac.uk/sites/LivingLegacies1914-18/HostedSites/RAF100CommemorateEducateInspire/index.html)”\) for engaging Air Cadet Squadrons and young people in interpreting and recording historic airfields and aeronautical sites through using maps, aerial photographs and local fieldwork and site\-recording. This collaboration had a significant impact on the efficacy of the RAF100 programme, as attested by the RAF: 

 *‘The work undertaken by Living Legacies has helped <ins>increase the RAF’s profile</ins> in NI and <ins>brought our history to li</ins><ins>f</ins><ins>e for a wide audience</ins>…Living Legacies’ efforts in helping to <ins>achieve these aims</ins> has been invaluable’.  \[LL4\]** 

-  **Exploring contested and conflict heritage through digital and spatial humanities:** 

 The Centenary of WW1 and especially commemorating critical historical events of 1916 in Ireland had potential to heighten divisions between Nationalist and Loyalist communities, a key  [**policy concern**](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-world-war-commemorations-and-the-decade-of-centenaries) **identified by UK and RoI governments** in 2014. Living Legacies researchers addressed this directly through creating an outreach programme built around digital and spatial technologies to work with NI local communities to explore WW1 through ‘sharing heritage’, with significant impacts highlighted by the **Royal Geographical Society** **\[LL5\]**. 

 


 *‘The*  [*Geography of Service and Death*](https://arcg.is/0DH8Pv) *’—A community coproduced GIS and web\-map, created by collaboration between NLHF\-funded East Belfast & Great War project and Shankill Area Social History group through crowdsourcing and partnership with Living Legacies researchers* \[ **LL1/LL8\]** *.* 

Cross\-community research impacts in NI focusing on sharing WW1 heritage involved a close collaboration with **National Museums Northern Ireland** \(NMNI\) creating the “Remembering 1916” exhibition in 2016 **\[LL6\]**, and the NI **“Decade of Centenaries”** programme **\[LL7\]**, as well as leveraging and supporting a series of cross\-community NLHF\-funded WW1 Centenary inclusive heritage projects in NI, including Shankill Area Social History group \(£10k\), “Battlebags and Blimps” project with **Carrickfergus Museum** \(£10k\), East Belfast & the Great War \(£10k\), and a Peace\-IV funded project with **Down County Museum** \(£60k\). **\[LL8\]** 

 These collaborations forged deep partnerships between community groups from different backgrounds and heritage stakeholders and research bodies, with workshops, field\-surveys, map and landscape analyses, led by Lilley and the Living Legacies EC team, resulting in coproduced outputs, including digital\-platforms, events and exhibitions \(as set out in **LL1** and summarised by project leads in reflective case\-studies in **LL8**\]. Through exploring legacies of WW1, the impacts of this six\-year programme have achieved wide recognition by NI and UK policy\-makers as meaningful and significant for enhancing cross\-community relations: 

1.  Living Legacies’ impact on enhancing community relations through exploring and sharing contested heritage is commended by the **Community Relations Council \(CRC\).** Funded by the **Northern Ireland Executive,** CRC was established in 1990 to lead and support change towards reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust in Northern Ireland, and to implement the NI Executive's ‘Good Relations Strategy’ –  [*Together: Building a United Community*](https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/publications/together-building-united-community-strategy). The CRC notes: 

 *'It is in no small part down to Living Legacies that community groups and the public are coming to <ins>an understanding of the complexity of this period</ins> and that our sense of identity is becoming more permeable.  In our experience communities and individuals are interested in the broader narratives, however, without assistance and expertise being made available it is difficult to make this a reality.’* **\[LL9\]** 

1.  UK government recognition and endorsement of the significance of cross\-community impacts of Living Legacies’ in Northern Ireland is evidenced by **Department of Culture Media and Sport \(DCMS\)** in Westminster **. In July 2019 a report from DCMS Select Committee outlining ‘Lessons from the First World War Centenary’ specifically identified “the academic engagement centre at Queen’s University Belfast” in achieving this, and in** commenting on the wider significance of this outreach work the UK Prime Minister's special representative for the World War One centenary, Dr Andrew Murrison MP, stated: 

 “It has been that Irish dimension that has been the most heartening and, for me, probably <ins>one of the most productive things that we have achieved</ins>”. **\[LL10\]**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor David Stevenson has undertaken a wide\-ranging programme of research on the history of the First World War. As the UK marked the conflict's centenary from 2014 to 2018, this research has underpinned collaborations with beneficiaries including the British Library, the Imperial War Museum, the BBC, and the British Army. Through various expert advisory roles, educational resources, museum galleries, and cultural events, Stevenson's research has informed initiatives which have commemorated the dead, stimulated interest in the wider history of the war, and enhanced understanding of its lesser\-known stories and events. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Over the last 20 years, Professor David Stevenson has led an extensive programme of research on the First World War. Adopting a multi\-national and multi\-lingual perspective, and using a blend of military, political, diplomatic, and economic approaches, his work has investigated and analysed the causes, course, and conclusion of the conflict. Stevenson’s research, aided by LSE PhD students Marvin Fried, Michael Hemmersdorfer, and Charles Sorrie, has produced three major monographs **\[1\] \[2\] \[3\]**, drawing on archival sources in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the US, as well as here in the UK. 

 The 2004 book **\[1\]** provides a general history of the war, with emphasis on why it began, why it escalated, and on its termination, legacy, and impact. The coverage extends back into the nineteenth century and forward into the late twentieth. In addition to incorporating new archival research, it offers a synthesis of the English\-language literature \(and much of that in French and German\). It relates the outbreak of war to the pre\-1914 arms race, and integrates military, technological, political, and diplomatic explanations of the stalemate between 1915 and 1917. Its closing chapters examine how the stalemate was broken, and analyse the conflict’s continuing cultural, political, and economic influence through the 1920s, the 1930s, and during and after the Second World War. 

 The 2017 book **\[2\]** concentrates on a single, crowded year: 1917. An analysis of strategic and political decision\-making, it focuses on the choices to continue and to escalate the conflict. It examines German submarine warfare and American intervention; the disastrous offensives launched by Britain, France, Russia, and Italy; and the global repercussions of the European stalemate, including the Russian Revolution, Chinese intervention, “responsible government” in India, and the Balfour Declaration. The book investigates why governments could not find \(or deliberately rejected\) strategies for exiting short of total victory, despite there by then being little scope for doubt about the conflict’s human cost. By this means, it analyses the forces that perpetuated the conflict. 

 The 2011 book **\[3\]** analyses the 1918 campaigning \(on all battlefronts\) and the factors enabling Allied victory, including technology \(tanks, airpower, intelligence\), military manpower and morale, command of the seas, military and political leadership, and support from the home fronts. Particularly novel are the discussions of Allied superiority in logistics \- especially railways; largely neglected in earlier accounts \- and the calculations leading Germany to seek an armistice and its opponents to grant one. 

 Stevenson’s research has also yielded publications which have examined particular moments, stages, or issues of the conflict. For example, a 2012 article **\[4\]** presents the First World War as \- paradoxically \- a struggle between rival projects for European integration. Stevenson’s 2020 article **\[5\]** on the engineering strike of May 1917 reflects recent research into the British Left and the war, distinguishing the more focused grievances of British engineering workers from the wider political agendas of their counterparts on the Continent. And finally, his 2006 article **\[6\]** illustrates research into the peace settlement, showing that Germany’s imposed disarmament was justified as facilitating Allied disarmament – a commitment subsequently regretted. 

 Overall, Stevenson’s research represents a substantial and significant contribution to the literature on the First World War.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Between 2014 and 2018, the UK marked the centenary of the First World War. As part of this significant anniversary, Stevenson's research has informed a range of initiatives that have commemorated the war dead, stimulated interest in the wider history of the conflict, and enhanced understanding of some of its lesser\-known chapters and events. This work includes notable collaborations with the British Library on its pan\-European educational initiatives, the Imperial War Museum on its award\-winning First World War galleries, the BBC on one of its primetime television series, and other beneficiaries such as the British Army and National Theatre groups. These impacts were facilitated by Stevenson’s work in various expert advisory roles and are described in greater detail below. 

 **Europeana: **1914\-1918**, British Library** 

 In 2013\-2014 Stevenson was consultant to  [*1914\-1918*](https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/83-1914-1918), Europeana’s thematic collection on the First World War, which gathered untold stories and official histories of the conflict **\[A\]**. Europeana is a learning website which works with thousands of European archives, libraries, and museums to share cultural heritage for enjoyment, education, and research. The British Library led this project, liaising with 11 institutions from seven European countries and developing an English\-language web resource for First World War teachers. The site provides access to nearly 500 items and exhibits, including photographs, postcards, correspondence, propaganda material, and news clippings, all supported by commissioned articles from leading experts. 

 While the project was under development, Stevenson advised on a number of editorial matters. Drawing on his experience of researching and writing **\[1\]**, he advocated and obtained a change to the planned structure of the collection, rearranging the thematic sub\-sections into which the material was divided. He suggested prospective article authors and also personally contributed articles **\[A\]** – firmly grounded in the underpinning research – on “Europe before 1914”, “Origins and Outbreak”, “Making and Breaking Nations”, “Neutrality and Intervention”, “Supply and Logistics”, “The War Effort at Home”, and “The Aftermath of WWI”. On Stevenson’s recommendation the collection increased its coverage of the second half of the war as part of its expansion in 2018, with Stevenson again called on to recommend authors and contribute another piece on “How the First World War Ended”. These articles drew on research featuring in **\[1\] \[2\]** and **\[3\]**. He also delivered a companion lecture for London schoolchildren at the British Library in October 2014. 

 The site’s associated resources include materials in several languages, tailored to school curricula in the UK and in Europe. It has been promoted by the School Library Association \(Resources Blog, “WWI Resources from British Library”, 13 March 2014\); the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment \(“Creative Learning in the Digital Age, Online Teaching Resources for World War One”\); the BBC Schools WWI Secondary webpage; the North East War Memorials Project; the United States World War One Centennial Commission \(under “WWI Education Resources for Teachers”\); and the National World War I Museum and Memorial Education Resources section in Kansas City \(this is the only public museum in the US dedicated to WWI\). *Europeana 1914\-1918* was also featured in *The Guardian* Teacher Network’s \(21 July 2014\) “How to teach…the First World War” **\[B\]**. In a review of several WWI education resources for *Reviews in History*, Christopher Phillips wrote: “ *the unique selling point for the British Library…is the impressive quality and depth of the \[supporting\] articles. Written by a combination of internationally renowned scholars such as David Stevenson…the articles offer readers an introduction to the conflict based not upon ‘myths’ and popular perceptions but upon the latest academic scholarship*” **\[B\]**. As of November 2020, the website has received more than four million individual visits. Location data also shows that 37 countries have each visited the site at least 5,000 times, with visits from users from the United States alone amounting to in excess of 1.2 million **\[C\]**. 

 **Imperial War Museum** 

 Stevenson served on the academic advisory committee for the Imperial War Museum’s First World War galleries, which opened in July 2014. Costing GBP40 million, the galleries formed a centrepiece of the UK’s centenary commemorations. Stevenson’s appointment arose directly from his publications **\[1\] \[3\]** and he provided input across a number of areas of preparation, offering detailed comment on the design company’s initial concept, on gallery layout \(particularly on sequencing; i.e. the route intended to be taken by visitors\), on content \(of the different sections in the first part of the exhibition, on the outbreak of the war\), and providing expert quality assurance for the entirety of the exhibits’ accompanying text and captions. He coached museum staff on the war’s outbreak, identified by market research as the topic on which visitors most desired information. Stevenson also contributed to the advisory committee’s discussions about how to present more sensitive subjects to feature in the galleries, such as events in Ireland and Armenia. 

 Daily IWM visitor numbers in the first few months following the opening of the galleries were more than double the average prior to that time \(up to 8,000 per day from 3,000\) **\[D\]**. Visitor numbers remained consistently high throughout the centenary and even in the last couple of years: 2014\-2015, 796,000 \(70% attending WWI galleries\); 2015\-16, 709,000 \(75%\); 2016\-17, 741,000 \(75%\); 2017\-18, 678,000 \(72%\); 2018\-19, 187,000 \(75%\); 2018\-19, 221,000 \(83%\). Writing in the *Daily Telegraph*, Alastair Sooke celebrated the galleries’ “ *fascinating, and frequently heartbreaking, exhibits*” **\[D\]**, while the *New York Times*’ Edward Rothstein praised the “ *powerful presentations*” as “ *worth paying attention to, not only for what they say about World War I, but also for what they say about contemporary approaches to history*” **\[D\]**. The museum’s First World War galleries also received industry acclaim, winning Best Permanent Exhibition at the 2015 Museum \+ Heritage Awards, and also being chosen as the winner in the Exhibition Design Category of the Design Week Awards 2015 **\[E\]**. 

 In October 2014, the Head of First World War Gallery Content Team wrote to Stevenson to express his gratitude for his contributions, and those of his academic advisory board colleagues: “ *It has been a fantastic experience for us all and we are hugely in your debt for your expertise, your goodwill and for helping us to craft galleries which our visitors are finding so enthralling and which have won so much praise*” **\[F\]**. 

 **LSE public festivals and exhibitions** 

 Stevenson has worked closely with the LSE on public engagement initiatives to commemorate WWI, which drew heavily from the School’s own archives. He was consultant to the online 2014 exhibition, *WWI@LSE: a Common Cause*, associated with the 2014 LSE Literary Festival, advising on which items to include \(such as photographs, minute books, and excerpts from the *Clare Market Review* – the student magazine\) and providing the accompanying commentaries. Subsequently this material was also used as the basis of an International History Department podcast \(downloaded more than 2,300 times **\[G\]** since becoming available in October 2019\). With the Library he prepared an online exhibition for Google Arts & Culture, “The LSE’s War, 1914\-1918”, selecting themes, texts, and images, and writing the narrative. He was consultant to a 2019 exhibition, “Giving Peace a Chance: from the League of Nations to Greenham Common” \(linked to the 2019 LSE Festival\), advising on design, again selecting items from the LSE archives and providing the accompanying commentaries, as well as delivering a public lecture. The exhibition had 8,600 visitors **\[G\]**. Stevenson’s 2011 book **\[3\]** and his research on the British Left in the war **\[5\]** directly informed this work. 

 **BBC documentary series** 

 Stevenson was consultant for the BBC series, *Railways of the Great War with Michael Portillo*, produced by Boundless Productions. He was chosen for his knowledge of railways and WWI logistics, particularly as featured in **\[3\]**. He viewed first cuts of every episode, corrected inaccuracies, and copy\-edited the associated book, *Railways of the Great War with Michael Portillo*, by Colette Hooper \(Bantam Press, 2014\). For example, he identified one of the proposed illustrations as actually dating from the Second World War. Portillo interviewed him on how railway superiority assisted the Allies’ victory and how the disintegration of Germany’s logistical system contributed to its defeat. The BBC has broadcast this series three times, the first showing garnering an average audience of 1.1 million viewers \(6.4% share\), outperforming BBC2’s access prime average audience by 14% for total viewers **\[H\]**. 

 **British Army and Foreign and Commonwealth Office Historical Branch** 

 Stevenson was consulted by the British Army as part of Operation Reflect, which as well as forming part of the nation’s commemorations also sought to identify contemporary lessons from the history of the war, in particular from the conduct of the British Army’s continental campaigns. Stevenson delivered lectures at the Royal United Services Institution in 2014 and at Sandhurst in 2017, particularly emphasising the importance of logistical factors as described in **\[3\]**. He also joined a “staff ride” to Cambrai in 2014, lecturing cadets about the battle that took place there in 1917. He worked with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Historical Branch in organising two public conferences: one on the outbreak of the war \(2014\) and one \(with the National Archives and other stakeholders\) on the Treaty of Versailles \(2019\). Both conferences attracted attendances of over 100, including journalists, diplomats, academics, students, and members of the general public. 

 In addition to the impacts achieved working with these core beneficiaries, Stevenson’s research has also underpinned several other public\-facing initiatives. He wrote the text for two items \(on the blockade of Germany and the Battle of Verdun\) in the BBC iWonder series, which sought to make the most of the corporation’s vast archives of video, audio, text, and graphics, presented by historians and experts. Stevenson provided further expert quality assurance for the BBC by fact\-checking videos and essays for inclusion in its “Bitesize” feature on the 1918 armistice **\[I\]**. Drawing on his 2011 book **\[3\]**, he was consultant to Hotham Productions’ “Countdown to Peace, March to November 1918”, a 2018 audio dramatisation of *With Our Backs to the Wall*, that retold the history of the road to the 1918 Armistice. He wrote the historical programme notes for Sean O’Casey’s play, *The Silver Tassie*, revived at the National Theatre in 2014, and in July 2016 briefed c.100 participants as part of Project Octagon, a modern memorial to mark the centenary of the Battle of the Somme and organised by *14\-18 Now\!*, the body responsible for art commissions commemorating the war, and the National Theatre. Photos and reactions to the project, which unfolded without advance publicity, soon spread across social media under the \#WeAreHere hashtag and garnered national media coverage **\[I\]**. Contributions to other educational initiatives include reviewing articles prior to publication in the Germany\-based project *1914\-1918 Online: International Encyclopaedia of the First World War*, supported by the Freie Universität Berlin, the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. 

 Beyond these examples, Stevenson’s research and publications led to many appearances before non\-academic audiences throughout the centenary. He gave invited keynotes at literary festivals in Toronto, Edinburgh, Malta, and Great Malvern, at the National Defence College in Tokyo, at the Liberty War Memorial, Kansas City, and to the Western Front Association. In all he gave some 40 public lectures, including two recorded talks at Gresham College. A 2014 Gresham lecture providing an overview of the war’s military history had received 54,438 views by October 2018.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research on historic landscapes, particularly the theory, method and practice of historic characterisation – a new context\-based and non\-site approach to the management of landscape heritage – led to impact in several ways: 

-  Characterisation methods developed by Newcastle researchers were incorporated by Highways England into the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, providing an official method used for environmental assessment of all new major roads in the UK from 2007 until September 2019, and for other infrastructure projects including HS2 and airport expansions. 

-  Datasets created during research projects at Newcastle have been used continuously in heritage management and environmental planning by local authorities and national agencies including Historic England, Natural England and the Marine Management Organisation. 

-  Newcastle research on historic characterisation methods and their application shaped public policy and guidelines for practice in countries including Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey, and research policy in the European Union. 

-  Over 850 person\-days of tailored training based on methods developed at Newcastle were delivered to international early\-career landscape professionals between 2014\-20, enabling them to implement GIS\-based historic landscape character assessment in countries including Brazil, China, Italy, Spain and Turkey. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Landscape character reflects the ongoing interaction of cultural and natural processes; approaches which use landscape character are increasingly important in rural, urban and maritime contexts in response to challenges ranging from spatial planning to climate change. Turner and Fairclough’s research at Newcastle on historic landscape character has created knowledge about the archaeology and cultural significance of landscapes and thus their significance for heritage management and planning \( **PUB1**\). Research on GIS\-based historic landscape characterisation \(HLC\) has developed better methods, created new datasets, and contributed to the translation of research and theory from landscape history and heritage into policy in the UK; it has also demonstrated that historic characterisation can be adapted and used in different contexts around the world \( **PUB2**\). 

 From 2004\-14 research focussed on the development of methods for interpreting and mapping the historic character of landscapes and seascapes in the UK, working in partnership with public sector organisations \(especially English Heritage/Historic England\). For example, Turner completed the Devon HLC for English Heritage in 2007 in collaboration with Devon County Council, and the Tyne & Wear metropolitan HLC \(with Newcastle City Council\) in 2014 \(e.g. **PUB3**\). Drawing on the methodological and theoretical aspects of this research, Turner and Fairclough contributed as authors to the Highways Agency’s national guidance Assessing the Effect of Road Schemes on Historic Landscape Character \(2007\). Turner and Fairclough also contributed to the national stakeholder groups which developed methods for seascape characterisation from 2006\-10, and Turner was commissioned by English Heritage to lead two Historic Seascape Characterisation \(HSC\) projects as part of the national programme \(Irish Sea HSC \(2010\-11\) and East Yorkshire\-Norfolk HSC \(2013\-14\)\). During this period, pilot studies led by Turner on the application of HLC in Greece, France, Ireland, Italy and Turkey were funded by research councils in the UK, Ireland, Spain, France and the EU’s FP7 and Culture programmes to test and develop methodologies suited to those countries \(e.g. **PUB4**; GRANTS 1, 2\). 

 In 2014 the McCord Centre for Landscape was established at Newcastle University with Turner as founding Director. The McCord Centre’s aims include fostering inter\- and transdisciplinary work with public stakeholders and industry partners in the UK and beyond, in pursuit of the vision of landscape set out in the 2010 ESF/COST Science Policy Briefing Landscape in a Changing World \(of which Fairclough was a lead author\). One primary objective of the Centre is to extend the impact of Newcastle’s landscape research. From 2014\-2020, the McCord Centre team led by Turner carried out historic landscape research in the UK and further afield, from Atlantic and Mediterranean Europe to western Asia, North America and South America. New interdisciplinary work experimented with modelling future change in rural and urban historic landscapes in Britain, Turkey and Brazil. By combining geoarchaeological approaches and intensive field survey with GIS\-based characterisation, research led by Turner has modelled local landscape changes with increased chronological precision in Britain, Spain, Greece and Turkey \(e.g. **PUB5**; GRANT 3\). 

 Increasing the efficacy of public and stakeholder participation is recognised as a key challenge, and work at Newcastle has created tools to enable stakeholders to participate more effectively in data collection and landscape management, especially in Greece, Turkey and the UK \(e.g. GRANT 4\). These transdisciplinary approaches to landscape and heritage were also developed at the European level through collaborations including JPI\-CH ‘Cultural heritage in landscape – CheriScape’ \(GRANT 5\) and COST IS1007 ‘Investigating cultural sustainability’ \( **PUB6**\), which both highlighted the value of culture\-based approaches and solutions which include stakeholders to the challenges of future sustainability. Turner and Fairclough continue to lead work on the development of participatory tools, particularly digital methods for citizen engagement \(e.g. GRANT 6\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 *Supporting landscape management and planning* 

 In 2006\-7 Turner and Fairclough were part of the team convened by the Highways Agency which authored new guidance on landscape assessment designed to mitigate the impact of major road construction on historic landscapes. They contributed principally to the methodology based on their research on HLC. The resulting guidance was incorporated directly into the 2007 Design Manual for Roads & Bridges \(DMRB, Vol. 11, 3.2.7\), which provided the mandatory methodology for environmental assessment in advance of all major road schemes in the UK up to September 2019 \( **IMP1**\). Among the most significant examples where the guidance has been implemented to inform road design include the A1\(M\) Leeming\-Barton \(20km, built 2014\-18\), A14 Cambridge\-Huntingdon \(34km, built 2016\-20\), Lower Thames Crossing \(scheme design 2012\-20\), Oxford to Cambridge Expressway \(scheme design 2014\-18\), A303 Stonehenge \(Amesbury and Berwick Down\) \(scheme design 2015\-18\). Furthermore, the DMRB text provided the basis for the environmental assessment methodology used for the High Speed 2 \(HS2\) railway Phases 1 \(2012\), 2a \(2016\) and 2b \(2018\) from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds \(e.g. **IMP2**; HS2 Phase 1 enabling works commenced in 2016, construction from 2020\). In all these examples, the historic character was used to guide the landscape mitigation design – which includes replicating the field patterns, boundary types and historic woodland disrupted by construction along the line of route. Other major development projects have also used this method for historic environment impact assessment during this REF cycle, for example the strategic Appraisal of Sustainability for the projected Heathrow and Gatwick airport expansions \(2018, **IMP3**\). 

 The results of HLC projects for Devon and Tyne & Wear completed at Newcastle University by Turner form part of historic environment records which are used daily by local planning authorities to inform decisions about landscape planning and management, in development control work, and in the production of development plans in line with the National Planning Policy Framework. For example, in 2020 the Devon HLC data supported over 630 development management, 250 strategic planning and 170 Countryside Stewardship Scheme consultation responses \( **IMP4**\). In 2017 the HLC and HSC data created through four projects led by Turner were incorporated into two national databases which provide consistent historic characterisation for maritime and terrestrial landscapes across England \- Historic England’s National HSC Database \(NHSC\) and Natural England’s National Historic Landscape Characterisation Database \(NHLC\). The HSC databases have been part of the evidence register used by the UK Marine Management Organisation \(MMO\) since 2018 as data layers in the national Seascape Character Assessments \( **IMP5**\) in line with the UK Marine Policy Statement 2011. These data underpin implementation of regional Marine Plans under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, giving the broader historic dimension of maritime environments beyond isolated sites a more significant role in marine planning than ever before. 

 *Shaping international policy* 

 International activities including participation in Council of Europe meetings and workshops on the European Landscape Convention \(ELC\) have helped to extend the reach of Newcastle’s impact into other parts of the Europe. For example, in Ireland Fairclough was part of the Steering Group convened by the Heritage Council \(the state heritage agency\) which helped to prepare the 2013 Best Practice Guide for landscape characterisation \(which cites Turner’s work on method development in Greece and Turkey, and in Ireland through the INSTAR ‘Making Christian landscapes’ project, GRANT 1\); the Guide informs the Irish government’s National Landscape Strategy 2015\-25 which establishes principles for protecting and enhancing the landscape while positively managing its change \( **IMP6**\); HLCs have consequently been implemented at local \(e.g. Brú na Bóinne UNESCO World Heritage Site\) and county scales \(e.g. Co. Donegal\). From 2010\-16 Turner collaborated on the Catalan Landscape Observatory’s PaHisCat project, which informed landscape assessment methods used in the Catalan Landscape Catalogues and the implementation of HLCs for several local authorities \(for example in Priorat\-Montsant\-Siurana, where the HLC was created in 2016 to support UNESCO World Heritage nomination as well as local planning and tourism initiatives: **IMP7**\). In the Netherlands, the research informed the approach used in the national characterisation programme \(e.g. RCE\-CHA project ‘Panorama Landschap’, 2017; **IMP8**\). In Belgium, Newcastle researchers have worked with officials from the Government of Flanders on tools to support the implementation of the ELC, including through a workshop co\-organised by the McCord Centre in Brussels in October 2019 for 200 government officials. This work influenced the government’s 2019 decision to include creation of a participatory landscape characterisation as part of the policy programme legally enacted by parliament for 2019\-2024 \( **IMP9**\). 

 In 2012\-13 Fairclough participated in a Europe\-wide advisory network to define the objectives of the Joint Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage \(JPI\-CH\). Among the first projects funded by the JPI\-CH was CHeriScape \(GRANT 5, coordinated by Fairclough, 2014\-2016\), which has influenced EU thinking on rural landscape management through its conclusions on leveraging the relationships between landscape and heritage to overcome sectoral fragmentation through cultural solutions \( **IMP10**\). The success of CHeriScape resulted in Fairclough jointly authoring the Call text for the JPI\-CH’s EUR4,500,000 ‘Changing Environments’ programme \(2017\), whose core aims included partnership and knowledge exchange with non\-HEI organisations; the programme resulted in five projects working in 11 countries from 2018\-21. 

 *Building international capacity: training early career practitioners in landscape and planning* 

 From 2013 to 2020 Turner and Fairclough led 19 landscape characterisation projects with 32 partner organisations in 14 countries. These projects included delivery of more than 850 person\-days of tailored training based on the research into the theory, methods and practical application of GIS\-based landscape characterisation. Through this training early career landscape practitioners in Belgium, Brazil, China, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Turkey learned for the first time how to design, create and use historic characterisations to support landscape planning and management. For example, in Turkey training delivered in the framework of four Newton\-funded projects \(2014\-19\) reached more than 100 Turkish early career professionals from 34 institutions working in landscape, heritage and planning. Activities included a week\-long ‘Researcher Links’ workshop for 40 people in 2016, 5 intensive training days with 15 participants each in Istanbul and Izmir between 2016\-2019, and 13 person\-months of training for 7 Turkish early career researchers on placement in Newcastle. The training has enabled participants to implement HLCs which now underpin landscape management in several regions of Turkey, for example around the UNESCO candidate World Heritage Site at Arslantepe, Malatya \( **IMP11**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Concerns about the social and environmental impacts of business in developing countries arose as value chains became increasingly global in nature. Sustainable Supply Chain Initiatives \(SSIs\) seek to improve business supply chain impacts on producers, workers, communities, and environments. NRI research highlighted an evidence gap on SSIs’ effectiveness, and strengthened SSI’s capacity to learn about their impact. This informed their organisational strategies and enhanced the livelihoods of producers and workers, especially women. NRI research on Responsible Business Initiatives has improved learning and action, enhancing impacts on global company supply chain workers, producers, communities, and environments. It has informed UK government policy and programming, catalysing a shift to more systemic approaches. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Since 2000, the University of Greenwich’s Natural Resources Institute \(NRI\) has undertaken a major body of research producing over  [100 publications](https://www.nri.org/development-programmes/sustainable-trade-and-responsible-business/overview) on SSI strategies and impacts relating to supply chain responsibility and sustainability. SSIs employ a diverse range of mechanisms. Over the last three decades they have sought to try and address sustainability issues in global trade, such as disadvantaged workers’ and farmers’ livelihoods and rights, and tackling the environmental impacts of business. Some SSIs promote greater fairness in trade, such as the Fairtrade Foundation. Some SSIs target products, setting standards for their production and assuring buyers through certification and labelling \(sustainability standards, such as Fairtrade International, Rainforest Alliance, Better Cotton Initiative\), and are represented by a membership body, ISEAL. Other initiatives work through codes of conduct which set standards for suppliers, with compliance checked through auditing. Responsible Business Initiatives \(RBIs\) employ various levers to influence corporate conduct \(e.g. mobilising investor pressure, creating public benchmarks to rate corporate performance\). 

 Our research identified an evidence gap on the effectiveness and impact of sustainable supply chain initiatives and conducted a landmark meta\-review of evidence on Fairtrade impact \( **Nelson, V.** and **Pound, B.** 2009\). We helped SSIs to understand and use Theory of Change Methodology, by first setting out how they intend to bring about change and articulating the causal connections between planned actions and anticipated impacts. They then gather evidence to show if and how their interventions have made a difference, assessing the actual changes brought about for farmers, workers, communities, and environments affected by business and trade. This approach was previously unfamiliar to SSIs and the development community **\(3.6; 3.2\)**. This work generated evidence on the effectiveness and impact of different initiatives \(sustainability standards, corporate codes, responsible business initiatives\) in different commodities \(cotton, tea, cocoa, coffee\), and countries **\(3.3; 3.1\)**. It challenged the widespread assumption that well\-intentioned initiatives achieve sufficient, or only positive, social, and environmental impacts. We also further demonstrated that the impact of sustainability standards and movements is *highly variable and context specific* **\(3.6; 3.4\)**. 

 An important methodological finding was that theory\-based evaluation and an outcomes\-focus for SSIs are essential for learning about and improving impact in conditions of complexity **\(3.5\)**. Quality in evaluation requires balancing both rigour and utility **\(3.5\)**. Robust evidence is required by donors and the wider community of practice to inform their policies **\(3.1; 3.3; 3.2\)** but obtaining such evidence especially from private sector\-led development poses challenges. On social and environmental impacts, NRI revealed that SSIs deliver *important livelihood and environmental benefits* \( **3.6**\). However, these are not enough to raise producers and workers out of poverty or to tackle broader structural issues, such as food and land tenure insecurity or gender inequality **\(3.6\).** There are unintended and unrecognized exclusions \(e.g. landless, the poorest, women producers, casual and temporary workers\). Product coverage and uptake by companies is variable **\(3.6\)**. We found that SSIs needed to scale up their impact on household incomes and livelihood assets and address previously neglected issues \(e.g. climate resilience, gender equality, livelihood diversification and wider landscape management\). Also, systemic issues are beyond the reach of SSIs \(e.g. land insecurity, deforestation, infrastructure, child and forced labour, corporate governance rules\) so they require additional or alternative measures **\(3.6\)**. We demonstrated that more realistic stakeholder expectations of SSI effectiveness were necessary, plus more collaborative governance and multi\-stakeholder partnerships across sectors and landscapes, additional development partnerships to increase farmer/worker incomes and livelihood security and attention to issues of power and participation **\(3.6\)**, and measures such as regulatory interventions **\(3.2\).**

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **NRI research and sustained engagement has informed SSIs and donors, causing strategic policy changes and actions, leading to** **improved impacts on producers, workers, communities, and environments in or affected by global value chains in low and middle income countries \(LMICs\).** Millions of workers, smallholders, and communities in agricultural, forestry and apparel global value chains face poverty, human rights abuses, livelihood insecurity and environmental degradation. NRI’s research has directly informed the SSIs who target these groups. Examples: Ethical Trading Initiative – 15 million workers, Better Cotton Initiative \(BCI\), 2.1 million licensed farmers; Fairtrade International, 178,051 plantation workers and 1.7 million farmers in producer organisations. The types of impact achieved are a\) Increased smallholder producer and worker income, livelihood security, and environmental improvements; b\) Greater gender equality and participation of women smallholders temporary / casual workers in different SSIs and share of livelihood benefits; c\) More effective programming and partnerships for transformative impact across sectors. 

 <ins> **Impact claim 1: Organisational strategy changes of Better Cotton Initiative catalysed, enhancing their impacts on the livelihoods of cotton producers and workers in LMICs, especially India and enhanced environmental impacts \(3.1\)</ins>:** Better Cotton Initiative \(BCI\), a non\-profit organisation, is the largest cotton sustainability programme worldwide, reaching more than 2.3 million cotton farmers in 23 countries, accounting for 22% of global production in 2018\-19. It has 1,840 members \(companies, farmer organisations\), who source more than 1.5 million tonnes of “Better Cotton” in 2019. Its goal is to improve cotton production for producers, the environment and for the sector’s future. BCI is currently refining its 2030 Global Strategy, informed by NRI’s 2015\-18 user\-oriented study **\(5.1a\)** and dissemination of its recommendations to BCI Governing Council\) **\(5.1b and 5.1c\)** *,* with a stronger outcomes\-focus, and adoption of a ‘farmer\-centric’ engagement model to increase farmer impact **\(5.1c\)**. BCI has already: a\) strengthened due diligence and monitoring of its implementing partners; b\) developed a gender baseline, implementing a Global Gender Strategy and recruiting decent work specialists; and c\) adopted an area\-based approach as a direct result of NRI’s research in India, recognizing the need for collaborative governance and investment in complex, challenging contexts, with funding secured and pilots underway in Pakistan and Turkey **\(5.1c\)** *.* 3,500 farmers in Andhra Pradesh have benefited in terms of livelihood security from a more effective implementation by BCI’s project implementer, the NGO PRDIS, and BCI’s improved decision\-making, due to NRI’s research \(2015\-19\) \( **5.1d\).** 

 <ins> **Impact claim 2:</ins> <ins>Organisational strategy changes of Fairtrade organisations catalysed, enhancing their impacts on the incomes, livelihoods of disadvantaged producers and workers, especially women, in LMICs</ins> <ins>\(3.4; 3.5\)</ins>:** Fairtrade International is a non\-profit, multi\-stakeholder association of 22 member organisations \(three producer networks and 19 national Fairtrade organisations\). Its label, the Fairtrade mark, appears on 35,000 products, such as coffee and cotton, sold in 145 countries. It works to make trade fairer through standards, certification, producer support, and advocacy. There are 1,822 Fairtrade producer organisations, representing 1.7 million producers. Benefits for producers include organisational capacity strengthening, reduced price volatility and Fairtrade Premium Payments on sales, with €871 million earned by producers over the past 5 years. NRI’s Fairtrade studies have led to organizational policy and strategy changes, improving impact on disadvantaged producers and workers; ‘ *NRI’s work has made a significant contribution to Fairtrade becoming more of a learning organisation, helping it to learn what works and feeding this in to strategy improvements, creating more positive benefits for disadvantaged smallholders and workers around the world.* *For example, it has particularly encouraged greater attention to issues of gender, with NRI research work acting as an important catalyst in the development of Fairtrade’s gender strategy*’ **\(5.2c\)**. Our Fairtrade coffee study is regarded as an important source of evidence on the impacts and challenges of Fairtrade which is utilised in the coffee sector **\(5.2a\).** The management response to this study states that it forms the basis for the F.I. Fairtrade Coffee Plan \(2016\-2020\), leading to five priority action areas **\(5.2d\)**. Our Fairtrade Cotton study similarly informed F.I.’s organisational and global strategy **\(5.2b; 5.2e\)**, enhancing their impact and focus on evaluation and learning. NRI significantly contributed to Fairtrade launching their new impact monitoring system in 2016, which generated positive case studies for Brazil, Ethiopia, and Palestine **\(5.2f\)**. 

 <ins> **Impact claim 3: Improved ISEAL and Sustainability Standard Members’ Learning and Action increasing their impact on producers, workers, communities, and environments in</ins> <ins>LMICs</ins> <ins>\(3.6\)</ins>:** ISEAL is the global membership organisation for ambitious, collaborative, and transparent sustainability initiatives, with a strategic global role in driving governmental and company efforts to increase sustainability of commodity trade, tackling issues such as climate change, deforestation, poverty, and inequality. Currently, it has 26 members, e.g. Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International, Better Cotton Initiative, Forest Stewardship Council, Bonsucro, Marine Stewardship Council, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. The members, who collectively reach millions of workers and producers in LMICs, have increased their investment in learning and action to scale up their social and environmental impact **\(5.3a; 5.3b\)** *.* NRI improved their understanding and communication of how they intend to effect change, by pioneering theory of change approaches to evaluation **\(5.3a\)** *.* NRI’s sustained engagement with ISEAL and members since 2009 helped to strengthen their monitoring, evaluation, and learning capacity, creating a stronger outcome\-focus **\(5.3d\)**. It led to ISEAL’s project, *Demonstrating and Improving Poverty Impacts’* \(2013\-15\), involving rigorous impact evaluations \(including our BCI study\), distilling key lessons for members, and encouraging other researchers to address this evidence and learning gap. Our engagement with ISEAL, contributed, in 2016, to ISEAL publishing a collaborative research agenda \(which cited our study on the effectiveness and impact of sustainability standards\) and demonstrates the growing global research effort to find ways to measure and increase SSI impacts on the ground **\(5.3c\)** *.* Our pioneering work raised ISEAL’s awareness of the need for good evidence and learning leading them to launch **Evidensia** in 2019, an online ‘credible evidence’ platform catalysing sustainability action through sharing of evidence and lessons for researchers, policy makers and practitioners. NRI has also contributed to this new platform \(two blogs, sharing reports\). ISEAL’s Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning Manager states: *“NRI’s research has helped the systems they have studied learn about how to improve their interventions, in order to deepen and broaden impact.” **\(**5.3a\)**. 

 <ins> **I**</ins> 

 <ins> **mpact</ins> <ins>claim 4. Improved learning and action by Responsible Business Initiatives increasing their impact on producers, workers, communities, and environments in LMICs \(3.2\):**</ins> In 2014, the Department for International Development \(DFID\) funded the £30 million Responsible, Accountable and Transparent Enterprise \(RATE\) programme. RATE funded 12 global organisations \(e.g. UN Global Compact, World Benchmarking Alliance, B Lab, ShareAction, Ethical Trading Initiative, Global Reporting Initiative\) to scale up their work to improve business social and environmental impacts. Each RATE partner has large scale global reach to companies, e.g. 12,600 companies from 160 countries currently sign up to and are engaged by the UN Global Compact, and more than 10,000 companies report using the Global Reporting Initiative \(GRI\) standard. Each of these companies affects millions of supply chain workers, producers, communities, and environments, e.g. Ethical Trading Initiative \(ETI\) through corporate members reached over 15 million workers in 2019. In 2020, ShareAction’s Workforce Disclosure Initiative engaged with 52 investment institutions, with $6.5 trillion in assets under management, and with141 global companies **\(5.4a\)**. A strategic objective of RATE was to build the evidence base on social and environmental impacts of business activity. NRI was responsible for the monitoring, evaluation, and learning of RATE. NRI significantly strengthened the capacity of all these organisations to learn how to improve their impact. DFID’s Annual Review of the programme **\(5.4b\)** states that: *‘Thousands of companies around the world have been positively impacted by the RATE partners, and those partners have built stronger delivery models with better means to assess performance.’* By the end of NRI’s support for RATE programme learning, the capacity of the 12 partners to develop theories of change and produce impact evidence \(through Action Plans\) had been significantly strengthened **\(5.4c; 5.4d; 5.4e\)**. Several partner organisations have since published case studies which have informed their strategies and more effectively communicate the benefits of their work **\(5.4a; 5.4e\)**. 

 <ins> **Impact claim 5: Informed UK government policy and programme strategies on responsible business, stimulating government support for more systems\-oriented, sector wide and mandatory approaches \(3.3\):</ins>** NRI has worked with UK Department for International Development, generating evidence on the effectiveness of different approaches for advancing business social and environmental responsibility. NRI’s impact of sustainability standards study **\(3.6\)** highlighted the benefits, but also limits of this approach. The study recommended innovations by sustainability standards and encouraged DFID to look at additional mechanisms for transforming whole commodity production sectors and landscapes, for example, through collaborative stakeholder approaches. DFID then funded the membership body, ISEAL, specifically to focus on innovation for enhanced impact. DFID subsequently invested in sector and landscape initiatives through the £57.39 million Partnerships for Forests Programme. Another example of how evidence directly informed donor policy on global trade relates to DFID’s decision to fund a policy review **\(5.5a\)** which drew heavily on NRI’s findings on the limits of voluntary responsible business initiatives in the Mid\-term Evaluation of DFID’s RATE programme **\(3.2\)**. Voluntary approaches rely on coaxing companies to disclose more information – but information alone has proven insufficient to drive real change, especially for workers, smallholders, communities, and environments at the production end of global value chains. NRI highlighted the need for a more systems\-oriented approach, focusing on combinations of more effective measures involving governments, regulations \(mandatory due diligence\), corporate governance innovation \(e.g. ‘for\-benefit’ enterprise\), impact evidence, mobilizing investors, and collaborative multi\-stakeholder approaches. DFID commissioned a policy review \(2020\) after our mid\-term evaluation. It drew heavily on our findings, consequently informing DFID’s policy on global trade, which includes a growing focus on combinations of more effective measures involving governments and regulations \(e.g. human rights or deforestation due diligence\), and attention to power issues, corporate governance, impact evidence, and mobilizing investors etc. NRI’s work on the RATE programme – both research findings shared with DFID and facilitation of intensive learning by the RATE organisational partners over three years \- pointed to the need for more far\-reaching combinations of measures. NRI’s work improved the success of the RATE programme and this is confirmed by DFID in their 2020 RATE Project Completion Report **\(5.4a\).** It states that the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning \(MEL\) support which NRI provided to the RATE partners ‘ *was a key success of the overall programme’* and *‘Learning from RATE – over the 6 years \- has been instrumental in generating interest in and building capacity to deliver responsible business initiatives*.’ DFID accepted the strategic need for *‘a more systemic programmatic approach to achieve focused and lasting impact’* including attention to power across supply chains, mandatory regulations and use of impact evidence **\(5.4a\)**. Aligned with NRI’s RATE programme mid\-term review findings and recommendations **\(3.2\)**, DFID funded a final project, a major initiative promoting ‘for benefit’ companies through policy, procurement, and data interventions in West African cocoa, taking a more systems\-oriented approach **\(5.5c\).** Additionally, NRI’s 2019 evaluation of DFID’s Trade and Global Value Chain Initiative informed DFID’s strategy on how to effectively engage with the private sector for positive development outcomes for workers, smallholders, communities, and environments affected by business. NRI provided ‘ *valuable information to inform DFID’s work’* and NRI’s findings *‘have already been used to inform programme decisions in these areas, and this final evaluation report will be disseminated within DFID to inform future programming decisions.’* **\(5.5b\)**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Gibbon’s research increased understanding among the public and arts professionals of how international arms trading is legitimised by cultural rituals such as music, hospitality, and etiquette. Her insights influenced a play about the arms industry, making significant material contributions to two campaigns that resulted in BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defence contractor, withdrawing sponsorship of the Great Exhibition of the North \(GEON\), and The National Festival of Making. Further acknowledged by artists Tatham and O’Sullivan in their installation at The Baltic, her research has raised international awareness of the ethics of corporate sponsorship of the arts. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 One of the world’s largest arms exporters, the UK sells weapons to countries listed as human rights abusers by the Foreign Office, enabling \(for example\) Bahrain’s violent suppression of pro\-democracy protests, and Saudi Arabia’s airstrikes on Yemen. Through her practice\-as\-research methodologies, exhibitions, campaigns, and fieldwork at international arms fairs, Gibbon reveals how the arms trade, one of the world’s most secretive industries, is validated, normalised and justified. Consequently, Gibbon’s research has engendered a major expansion in the range of research into the international arms trade and how this information can be disseminated to the public. 

 Disguised as a security consultant, Gibbon visited 14 arms fairs in Europe and the Middle East from 2007\-20. Once inside, she made drawings and collected complimentary gifts, capturing how arms deals are legitimised through polite rituals and corporate hospitality. She produced over 100 sketchbooks depicting the garb, gestures and manners used by the weapons industry to project a respectable image, revealing a culture otherwise hidden from public view: a string quartet playing Mozart in the shadow of a tank; a fashion show in front of a rack of missiles whilst hostesses serve champagne.\(3.1\) Among the thirty or so complimentary gifts collected from arms companies during fieldwork were stress\-balls in the shape of bombs, grenades, and tanks; jellied sweet fighter jets; toffees in wrappers saying ‘welcome to hell’; and condoms with the slogan, ‘the ultimate protection’.\(3.2\) 

 This archive of sketchbooks and gifts provides new and novel insights into the disparity between the jaunty presentation of products at point\-of\-sale and their lethal purpose, showing how the cultural lingua franca of rituals like music, hospitality and etiquette are used to normalise the arms trade. Studies of the arms trade have predominantly been confined to the social sciences’ quantitative methods and rational analysis. However, etiquette isn’t easily quantifiable or rationalised; it’s aesthetic: performed, enacted, displayed.\(3.3\). Gibbon’s research applies practice\-led fine art methodologies of drawing, performance and working with found objects to provide qualitatively derived insights into a secretive and problematic industry. 

 Beyond the fairs, arms companies’ sponsorship of cultural events distracts the public from their military role and monetising of death. Gibbon addressed this by co\-founding the campaign group Art Not Arms \(ANA\) in 2018, petitioning against BAE Systems’ sponsorship of two arts festivals \(GEON and The National Festival of Making\), using campaigning as a critical art strategy allied with her visual artworks, similarly to artists such as Andrea Fraser, Hans Haacke and Micol Hebron. Both campaigns highlighted BAE System’s attempt to use arts sponsorship to detoxify its public image. 

 In 2018 Gibbon was awarded an Independent Social Research Foundation \(ISRF\) Early Career Fellowship, enabling her to disseminate her findings through an exhibition of sketchbooks, gifts, outfit, and photographs at the Bradford Peace Museum, one of the few museums in the world dedicated to peace and social reform, a unique venue for framing her research within a critical analysis of war. This research now comprises a book, and a book chapter. \(3.1,3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Gibbon’s research highlights how weapons sales in the arms trade are normalised through cultural rituals and sponsorship of events. Her research informed a play on the arms trade and resulted in BAE Systems’ withdrawal as sponsor of two national cultural events. 

 **Influencing public awareness of arms trade cultural sponsorship** 

 Gibbon’s research enhances understanding of how weapons manufacturers appropriate cultural rituals to ‘artwash’ products. New insights from her exhibitions on arms fairs were shared with combined audiences of 2,114,442 \(Source: Kantar\), attracting international press coverage from Al Jazeera \(2014\), BBC Radio Four \(2018\), The Guardian \(2014; 2018\), Folket i Bilt \(2019\), Frieze \(2019\), and BBC World Service \(2014, 2018\), who introduced Gibbon as ‘ *lifting the lid on the murky world of arms sales*’. \(5.1\) 

 Exhibitions at Bradford Peace Museum \(BPM\) and Royal West Academy \(2014\) attracted high audience numbers.\(5.2\) Alison Bevan described the 8,046 visitors to Royal West Academy as the ‘ *highest ever visitor numbers for the period’*\(5.3\), resulting in an 8\-month extension of the exhibition in an off\-site gallery, attracting 899 visitors \(5.2\). The exhibition changed people’s understanding of the arms industry. For example, audiences ‘ *did not know that the UK makes arms that are sold around the world and that are responsible for harming civilians’*, and also thought that Gibbon’s *‘eye\-opening exhibition unpicks the mystique of the arms trade’*. \(5.3\) 

 **Raising artists’ awareness of arms trade and reshaping arts production** 

 Gibbon’s BPM exhibition was instrumental to the development of Common Wealth Theatre Company’s play *I Have Met the Enemy*, a scene depicting an arms fair was based on Gibbon’s drawings, which revealed a world previously inaccessible to the actors. Co\-Director Evie Manning: *‘The exhibition's observations and depictions of the 'performance of respectability' has informed our play in such a way that we have built a significant opening scene around this idea and the characters, action and gestures that The Etiquette of the Arms Trade explored’*. \(5.4\) Audiences of 980 people saw the play in Bradford and Newcastle. The play travelled to Cardiff \(2019\); and will tour Edinburgh and London in 2021 \(delayed by COVID\-19\). Artists involved with GEON were previously unaware of the arms trade’s ‘art washing’ strategies. Artist Emily Hesse said that Gibbon’s work, *‘gives us an insight into something that we are not shown, this is a world which is hidden from us, and that’s how I really feel that her work was very beneficial to me at that time because it allowed me to see what was really going on behind the scenes in these arms fairs that I would have never otherwise seen.’* \(5.5\) Hesse documented this experience in an article for the book *Black Birds Born from Invisible Stars* \(2018\). 

 **Influencing collective action** 

 Gibbon’s research made a distinct and material contribution to the campaign that resulted in GEON dropping BAE Systems’ sponsorship in three ways. First, Gibbon co\-founded ‘Art Not Arms’ and wrote the petition garnering 2,366 signatures and national press coverage. \(5.6\) Second, Gibbon’s drawings persuaded headliners the Commoners Choir to pull out of GEON, re\-joining after BAE’s withdrawal. Choir leader Boff Whalley’s assertion that Gibbon’s work *‘alerted me to a side of the international trade in weapons that I hadn’t understood – that arms dealing is normalized with music, entertainment, and wine’*, \(5.7\) is echoed by Hesse’s view that *‘the campaign did definitely make a lot of artists aware of it \[the arms trade’s use of art washing\]’*. \(5.5\) Third, Gibbon’s research was used by artists Joanne Tatham and Tom O’Sullivan’s in their installation at BALTIC during GEON \(seen by 166,851.\(5.8\)\), which featured a history of anti\-power stances, with Gibbon’s research an important reference. According to Tatham, the installation *‘included a description of Gibbon going undercover into arms fairs, her drawings revealing a world, which, with its string quartets and champagne seeks to create an impression that weapons are no different from any other object of exchange…\[her\] project provided both a resource for our own exhibition and demonstrated how the forms and approaches of contemporary art practice can enact political enquiry*. *’* \(5.9\). 

 Art Not Arms demonstrably influenced the cultural sector, highlighting arts organisations’ responsibility to check sponsors’ backgrounds. The BBC cited its impact on Turner Prize sponsorship, stating, *‘What has also become absolutely clear over the past 12 months is that arts organisations have to up their game when it comes to basic due diligence before accepting a sponsor’s money’* \(5.10\). Following Gibbon’s second Art Not Arms petition against BAE’s sponsorship of The National Festival of Making \(23/04/2019\), BAE was dropped after two days. \(5.6\) 

 An ARTnews article ‘The Year in Protest’ identified activism as a key influence on the art world, especially *‘protests and petitions that called attention to abuses of power, inequity, and privilege in the cultural sector’*, citing Gibbon’s campaign as example of *‘\[one of\] the year’s notable art\-world disruptions’.* \(5.10\)

1.  **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 UAL has been instrumental in developing and promulgating ‘social design’, making a fundamental contribution to the intellectual evolution of this research field, by supporting a group of key scholars across the University to devise, develop and evaluate methodologies derived from an expanded notion of social design. The work of this group plays a key role in delivering UAL’s research strategy and has had impact nationally and internationally, enabling the practical application of collaborative design thinking to real world situations. Impact is evident across the public sector—in both central and local government—as well as in the private sector and civil society, reframing debates and generating new knowledge and practices in participation and engagement to produce positive outcomes for the lives of individuals and communities.

1.  **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Social design takes as its object not the design of products, communications, services or buildings but the design of society itself. UAL’s social design research focuses on developing and putting into practice a range of methodologies that draw upon research traditions in design, the humanities and social sciences. The UAL research team has built from existing models of social design, and evolved new and varied approaches to the field, maximising real world impact. This work is part of UAL’s objective to develop research that contributes to improving community resilience, and life\-long health and wellbeing. This work has developed at the University in a number of ways, as detailed below. 

 **Thorpe** \(co\-authored with Gamman\) first made the case for socially responsive design in ‘What is Socially Responsive Design? A theory and practice review’, examining decision\-making in response to social context. His 2011, peer\-reviewed research paper \(also with Gamman\) \[3.1\] took this thinking further, analysing how locating designers as co\-actors within a co\-design process can trigger and support meaningful social change. 

 **Malpass**’ work is situated in Design Studies. His 2013 peer\-reviewed journal article, published as a UAL Early Career Researcher \(ECR\), proposed three distinct types of critical practice in design, providing an analysis that constituted a new and significant way to examine the reflexivity of critical design practitioners. Together with an ongoing investigation by **Malpass** into critical practice, this research challenged established discourse and presented alternative roles for product design to those driven by technological and fiscal concerns. \[3.2\] 

 **Kimbell**’s research continues her long\-standing investigations into social design. Examples here are the application of design methods and expertise to social innovation, public services, policy and healthcare. These fields of practice and emergent disciplines exist within a wider context in which design approaches are increasingly visible and integrated into business \(e.g. customer experience design\), entrepreneurship \(e.g. lean start\-up\) and technological innovation \(e.g. agile product development\). 

 **Prendiville**’s extensive and ongoing programme of research around service design examines the potential for design to act as ‘bridge\-maker’ between disciplines and stakeholders. Key is a human\-centred, multi\-disciplinary approach to the design and communication of new processes, products and technologies. Adopting methods and concepts from anthropology, the research leading to **Prendiville**’s 2015 paper \[3.4\] reframed the importance of place and placemaking in the design of services for the elderly at two projects in Byker, Newcastle. 

 To further research and interrogate the debates around social design, UAL enabled a three\-year Visiting Chair post for influential researcher **Manzini**. *Design, when everybody designs* \(2015\) \[3.5\], written during his tenure at UAL, continued an investigation into what design can do to support social innovation, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration to transform practice. **Manzini** identified and interrogated initiatives ranging across community sharing of services for positive economic and environmental gain, new forms of exchange and barter, and neighbourhood gardens initiated and managed by citizens, to improve the quality of the city and the social fabric.

1.  **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 By enabling cross\-disciplinary work around social design across the University, and making key academic appointments, UAL has created a space to challenge, question and develop a varied set of approaches to the field. UAL’s Social Design Institute \(SDI\) is a major milestone in the development of the field \(pilot year 2019–20; first full year 2020/21, AKO Foundation, GBP300,000, 2018–19/2019–20\). Under the leadership of **Kimbell**, the Institute harnesses the potential of social design to address a multitude of large\-scale, complex challenges, with cross\-disciplinary work a priority. It has built on and expanded the strong work in this field already being produced by the group of researchers in this case study, while two recent Institute appointments— Patrycja Kaszynska, Senior Research Fellow \(2019\) and Jocelyn Bailey, Research Fellow \(2019\)—build on its core themes of values, systems and policy. 

 **Kimbell**’s research in design for policy—including a fellowship in the UK Policy Lab through an AHRC award—led to a role as consultant, supporting the EU Policy Lab team on the European Commission’s *The Future of Government 2030 project* \(2018–2019\). **Kimbell** co\-authored the report, which resulted in policy recommendations: “… \[It\] explored changing power relationships in society and new governance models and actors. The project examined stronger alliances of local governments through new types of political institutions \(such as the European Parliament of Mayors\) and stronger inclusion of individuals in policymaking through Citizen Councils. It has also proposed better synergies between the public and private sectors…”. \[5.1.\] This research and practice led to invitations to speak at events organised by the EU Joint Research Centre, Nesta, Danish Design Centre, Carnegie Mellon University and others and involvement in training UK and international civil servants in design thinking. 

 A key component of UAL’s social design work is the Public Collaboration Lab \(PCL, from 2015\), led by **Thorpe**. PCL is a strategic, AHRC\-funded research collaboration created to investigate what models might bring together citizens, local government, academic research and other agencies to facilitate collaborative action that delivers sustainable benefits to the public. PCL provides a vehicle for engagement with structures that deliver services, applying conceptual, abstract thinking to real world situations. The PCL was founded by the UAL DESIS Lab and the Strategy and Change team of Camden Council. UAL initiators included **Thorpe** and **Prendiville**, working closely with UAL colleagues in Knowledge Exchange. The University has supported the practical application of design innovation in particular relationship to its locality—in this case, a strategic collaboration in King’s Cross, London Borough of Camden. In the 18 months of the AHRC funding period, PCL worked with over 3,000 Camden residents, over 100 council officers from nine local authorities, and more than five schools. \[5.2.\] 

 Over four years, PCL has delivered more than 20 projects, designed by council officers and Heads of Service in collaboration with UAL researchers and community leaders, to be strategically useful to the council and the residents it serves. The project uses design\-led social innovation approaches to engage citizens and other stakeholders in the co\-design and co\-delivery of aspects of public services. Examples include the Home & Community Library Service \(H&CLS\) project that applied the methodology developed by the PCL research to navigate between user needs and the council, re\-thinking the council’s interaction with residents to improve the service for 400–500 Camden residents unable to leave their homes. The findings fed into a consultation document on the future of the H&CLS, which was delivered to council members. The ‘Overcrowded Living’ project engaged Camden residents, council officers and other stakeholders to examine the challenges faced by those living in overcrowded conditions to identify opportunities to improve the situation. A toolkit, website and further recommendations for phase two of the project, which is developing a ‘public and collaborative’ service model \(service delivered with and by service participants\) for design and manufacture of bespoke furniture appropriate to overcrowded conditions, has been well\-received by LBC officers and is being developed with the council's housing team. 

 “PCL has evolved from designing services to meet the needs of residents to creating a space which channels the collective creativity and imagination of our residents and partners into new platforms for innovation that are rooted in the distinctive identities of our neighbourhoods. It’s shown that you can develop a collaboration lab which works out in the open, helps residents and partners make and reinvent solutions together to local issues and scale them at a very human level”—Head of Corporate Strategy, London Borough of Camden. \[5.3.\] Other evaluations are positive: *“…* the PCL offered a very positive experience for all those involved. All interviewees could … identify a range of benefits from being involved, including a closer strategic collaboration between UAL and LBC, bringing innovation into the council, and creating a different type and quality of engagement with residents *.”* \[5.4.\] 

 Launched in September 2019 and located on a site behind the British Library in Somers Town, MAKE@Story Garden is a collaboration between UAL, Somers Town Community Association, LBC and property developer Lendlease. Developed by UAL to provide a local base for the work carried out by PCL, MAKE has delivered 169 workshops/activities/events engaging 1,694 participants \(1,339 local residents and 355 students\). The project’s Instagram posts have generated more than 17,000 hits. Nine community organisations have co\-delivered activities with MAKE to date. \[5.5.\] 

#  In 2019, UAL secured Horizon 2020 funding to extend the learning from projects including PCL and MAKE. T\-Factor \(2020–2024\), ‘Unleashing future\-facing urban hubs through culture and creativity\-led strategies of transformative time’, \(overall project budget EUR8,605,612.50\) challenges the ‘waiting time’ or ‘meanwhile’ in urban regeneration—the time between the development of the masterplan and the infrastructure being built—to demonstrate how culture and creative collaboration between academia, government, community and business can create inclusive urban hubs. With partners in Amsterdam, Bilbao, Kaunas, Lisbon and Milan, UAL is contributing to the London pilot by applying expertise in co\-design, creative public engagement and placemaking in London’s Euston regeneration area. 

 The reach and significance of **Prendiville**’s pioneering research is extensive, attracting significant funding. Central to her work is knowledge co\-creation through dialogue with project stakeholders. The notion of ‘placemaking’ \(e.g. a geographical location or a local authority\) links much of **Prendiville**’s work, from the Byker project, to the PCL, and the DARPI and DOSA projects, through a combination of methodologies including design and digital anthropology, and design practices \(e.g. mapping and prototyping\). Major projects include: ‘Re\-envisioning Infection Practice Ecologies in Nursing’ \(RIPEN, AHRC\-funded; Co\-I: **Prendiville**\), working in dialogue with nurses to look at why, though Antimicrobial Resistance \(AMR\) impacts on nursing practices, it does not feature centrally or in the nursing curriculum. Working with Anne Marie Rafferty, President of the Royal College of Nursing, a RIPEN Policy Lab briefing with stakeholders with AMR\-related expertise mapped how to transform the research content into policy, this then given to the RCN’s Head of Infection, Protection and Control, and contributing to an RCN policy paper for UK government. The EU Horizon 2020 Pharma Factory project, a collaboration between five biotech SMEs and four academic institutions \(2017–2021, Co\-I: **Prendiville**\), is applying a user\-centred approach to engaging stakeholders \(industry, government, regulators, patient groups, clinicians and the public\) to understand better the opportunities for plant molecular pharmaceuticals. Work so far is highlighting the importance of different ways to communicate with different stakeholder audiences in contentious areas. In 2017, to support the take up of design within science and technology innovation, **Prendiville** produced *A scoping study: Design's Role in the Satellite Applications and Transportations Systems Catapults*, funded by the Knowledge Transfer Network. This work went on to support the adoption of design and human centred practices across the Catapults. \[5.6.\] 

 AMR is a global problem and RIPEN led to three Bhabha Newton\-funded research projects exploring AMR in India: DOSA \(Diagnostics for a One Health User\-Driven Solution in AMR \(Co\-I, **Prendiville**\) \[5.7.\] and DARPI \(Drivers of AMR in Poultry in India\). **Prendiville** is one of a small number of researchers working at the intersection between design, science and technology, bringing an anthropological approach to investigate the complexities of AMR. DARPI is interrogating the poultry supply chain, looking at how design can affect complex supply chains and local practices. Findings from DOSA were presented at a UK Parliamentary AMR event at the House of Commons \(February 2020\). 

 Since 2009, Ordnance Survey’s \(OS\) Geovation scheme, with **Prendiville** as a judge, has supported UK startups focused on building local resilience within communities against real problems that need collaboration and design thinking across all sectors of the economy \(public, private, civil society and individuals\). Grants of up to GBP20,000 have enabled a wide range of projects, with extensive national reach. \[5.8.\] [](https://geovation.uk/about/) 

 **Malpass** has made a significant contribution to the field of Critical Design Practice through research into its function to extend the disciplinary agency of industrial design, contributing to its establishment as a model at UAL. His 2013 paper was published as *Critical Design in Context: History, Theory and Practices* \(Bloomsbury, 2017\), translated into Japanese and Chinese \(2020, 6,723 copies sold at 31 December 2020\); second edition in development. **Malpass**’ work is widely regarded as the first text to develop a holistic view of the subject; the book is a key text in this growing field \(Bloomsbury Academic’s best\-selling design\-focused publication, 2017–2018\). The work is widely cited regularly in design literature, while **Malpass** contributes to public understanding of the subject beyond academia through mainstream and design media. \[5.9.\] He judged the Core 77 speculative concepts awards \(2016\), delivers talks to design agencies, lectures internationally \(A/D/O, New York, 2017\) and is on the editorial boards of *CoDesign: International Journal of Co\-Creation in Design and the Arts* and the *Journal of Engineering Design*. 

 In 2015, UAL invested in *Cultures of Resilience*, a two\-year project co\-created by DESIS Network founder/UAL Visiting Chair **Manzini** with Professor Jeremy Till, Head of Central Saint Martins. The work explored the cultural dimension of resilience with a specific focus on ‘place\-related’ communities, with an agenda to answer how creative collaborative practices can contribute to creating the conditions for meaningful encounters between people. This pan\-UAL project ensured the further development of social design work at the University. The results of this were reported on in a special issue of international journal *SheJi* \(Volume 4, Issue 1. Elsevier, 2018\) co\-edited by **Manzini** and **Thorpe.** \[5.10.\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research conducted in the Creative Leadership and Enterprise Centre \(CLEC\) at Cardiff Metropolitan University has informed the policy and practice of sector stakeholders regionally and nationally, leading to significant growth and improved business outcomes in small\-to\-medium sized enterprises \(SMEs\), which account for 62% of all jobs in Wales. Two CLEC programmes, 20Twenty Leadership and Construction Futures Wales, have delivered SME business growth in excess of £155m, across 900 businesses, safe\-guarding and/or creating over 2,000 jobs and creating 25 new businesses. CLEC has thus leveraged £7m in grant funding to deliver a gain of £148m to the taxpayer \- a return\-on\-investment rate of over 2,000%. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Supported by £7million of funding, Creative Leadership and Enterprise Centre \(CLEC\) research informed the demand for, and design of, the 20Twenty Leadership and Construction Futures Wales Programmes, as well as their evaluation and implementation. **Clifton** and colleagues’ Economic and Social Research Council \(ESRC\) funded research together with European Development Fund \(EDF\) funded work by **Morgan** and others showed that SMEs in less competitive regions typically make less effective use of external knowledge sources such as networks, supply chains and universities, particularly for innovation. As a result, policy interventions in Welsh SMEs were found to have been suboptimal in raising growth and profitability. Subsequent research by **Clifton**, which built on a large research and delivery grant from the Wales European Funding Office \(WEFO; through the European Social Fund \- ESF\) \[A\] demonstrated that management of behavioural change was a potential route to improved SME performance \[R1\]. 

 The WEFO grant \[A\] research specifically identified the management and leadership challenges in South East Wales SMEs. It also highlighted fruitful areas of intervention including: organisational change; networking and knowledge sourcing; skills for innovation and creativity; and, coaching and mentoring \[R2\]. Further, research for the 20Twenty Leadership programme showed that ‘managing’ performance in conditions of relative certainty and agreement is not sufficient for success in the globalised knowledge economy. Rather, effective leadership is required to enhance performance throughout a business, regardless of size or sector. The most effective programme delivery mechanisms are comprised of a blend of tailored masterclasses, action learning sets, and peer\-to\-peer learning \[R3\]. 

 Related research on entrepreneurship across three UK regions \[R4\] demonstrated the importance of establishing policy interventions that are appropriately attuned to the particular challenges each region faces \- a finding that further shaped the design and delivery of the 20Twenty Programme. Although managed behavioural change can improve innovative performance \[R1\], nurturing a culture of creativity can be challenging. The design of the 20Twenty Programme was, therefore, further enhanced by research from **Loudon** and associates who developed the ‘Listen Connect Do’ \(LCD\) Model to cultivate and sustain creativity inside an organisation \[R5\]. 

 Subsequent research by **Francis and** **Loudon** considered how companies within supply chains can collaboratively learn and innovate more effectively. They developed the Supply Chain Organisational Learning and Innovation Framework \(SCOLIF\) which was used to identify cultural dimensions for managers to address when implementing multi\-organisation innovation projects \[R6\]. This research was invaluable in underpinning Construction Futures Wales \(CFW\), a funded construction sector leadership programme with an explicit supply chain focus \[B\]. Evaluative research undertaken once delivery of the 20Twenty Leadership programme was underway evidenced the positive impact of the programme on business performance and confirmed effective delivery mechanisms \(such as a focus on ‘soft’ skills, behavioural change, and action learning between delivery sessions\) \[R3\]. 

 In summary, CLEC research has underpinned the success of the 20Twenty Leadership and Construction Futures Wales Programmes, their design and implementation and their considerable and wide\-ranging impact.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The importance of SMEs to the global economy cannot be overestimated; they account for 99.5% of businesses across every main industry sector, 44% of all jobs in the UK and 62% of all jobs in Wales. The CLEC 20Twenty Leadership and Construction Futures Wales training programmes have collectively impacted nearly 900 SMEs, achieved business growth improvements of over £155m, safe\-guarded and/or created over 2,000 jobs and produced 25 new businesses. They have also helped deliver and shape Welsh Government policy. CLEC leveraged £7m in grant funding to deliver a gain of £148m to the taxpayer, a return\-on\-investment rate of over 2,000%. Their success is evidenced through cumulative business improvements; the transfer of best practice; and individual company level impact. 

1.  Cumulative National Business Improvement 

 **Morgan**, **Clifton**, **Francis** and **Loudon** have worked on CLEC Programmes since inception, delivering to 606 participants from 480 companies within the assessment period and providing business growth to 30 of the top 300 businesses in Wales. One third of 20Twenty participants reported company sales growth of at least 30% within two years of commencing the Programme \[E1\], totalling an estimated £120m of business improvements in the REF Impact period \[E2\], and creating 25 new businesses \[E3\]. Moreover, of companies reporting growth, 75% directly attributed this rise to programme attendance \[E2\]. 68% of the companies reported improved customer satisfaction, 60% increased profitability, and 82% improved decision\-making \[E2\]. Together, the 20Twenty and Construction Futures Wales programmes reached an additional 408 companies in construction supply chains, safeguarding and / or creating 2,014 jobs, with £36m of new business achieved \(against a £10m target\) \[E4\]. Participants also reported significantly improved leadership skills in key areas of collaboration. These include innovation and product / service development and coaching, as well as facilitating the upskilling of colleagues \[E3\]. Due to its success, the programme was opened up to sponsorship from larger organisations from 2015, \[E3\] with sponsoring organisations including Legal and General, General Dynamics, Admiral Insurance, Sport Wales and Willmott Dixon. 

1.  National Policy Delivery & Transfer of Research\-Informed Best Practice 

 The 20Twenty Programme contributed to meeting the central tenets of the ‘Lisbon Agenda’ of the Europe 2020 Strategy, and the success of ESF Regional Competitiveness, the Employment Programme for East Wales \[E3\]. It also contributed to Welsh Government’s Programme for Government \(2011\-16\) aim of achieving balanced and sustainable growth. Funding awarded by WEFO in 2015 \[C\] extended the reach of the programme from regional \(South East Wales\) to pan\-Wales, with Bangor University as delivery partner and a further grant extension to 2023 \[D\] cementing its reach to North East Wales \[E5\] 

 The impact of the programmes is further evidenced by additional funding and the appointment of key members of the research team to governmental and policy advisory roles. Specifically, significant follow\-on funding was obtained to explore the impact of leadership on company productivity and to provide policy recommendations \[E\]. In addition, **Morgan** was invited to join the Welsh Government Learning Skills and Innovation Partnership \(LSkIP\) Employment and Skills Board to contribute to skills development in Wales and **Clifton** was invited by the Federation of Small Business \(FSB\) in Wales to contribute to their strategy for developing the Welsh SME base \[E6\]. **Morgan** also gave evidence to the National Assembly Economy, Infrastructure and Skills Committee, promoting good practice among business\-skills providers nationally. Collectively, therefore, the CLEC programmes have had a significant impact on the Welsh economy, company performance, and the policy and practice of national, regional and sector stakeholders. 

1.  Individual Company Level Impact 

 Endorsements from individual companies demonstrated the value companies placed on the 20Twenty Programme, in particular the aspects of knowledge\-sourcing \- “I often came back from a session with new ideas or the will to challenge status quos”; and networking \- “people who will definitely become part of my future business contacts”; “I have a much better understanding of the management tools available to help bring about positive change in our company” \[E2\]  impact which accrued beyond programme attendance \- “The Programme provided wider impacts and outcomes \[planning, new business opportunities\] which continue to contribute to the company”; and, ultimately going beyond profitability or growth to the sustainability of the business itself “My company may not have been trading today if I had not been on the programme” \[E3\]. 

 Widespread endorsement of 20Twenty and its impact included that of **NatWest** Bank which actively promoted it to their client base \[E7\]. Other companies stressed the balanced implementation of both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ leadership factors that it enabled \[E8\]; the improvement in collaborative working across organisational and functional boundaries \[E9\]; improved strategic decision\-making and growth outcomes \[E10\]; knowledge sourcing and business objectives \[E11\]; and, processes and systems improvement \[E7\]. As a result, Admiral Insurance commissioned a **bespoke version** of the 20Twenty Programme \(2015\). Indeed, 20Twenty Cohort 4 included tailored provision for **28 Social Enterprise** organisations including charities, and housing associations with over 20,000 tenants in total.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Our world\-leading multidisciplinary research has raised the profile of the impact of gout on patients and the public, influenced national and international clinical guidelines and resources to allow practitioners to improve clinical management. It has increased understanding of people’s experiences of living with gout, shaped policy and practice, nationally and internationally, and influenced training in primary care and rheumatology. Our research has transformed clinical care through the creation of public\-facing resources, such as our  [module for healthtalk.org](http://www.healthtalk.org/peoples-experiences/bones-joints/gout/topics), which provides patients with online information about gout and how it affects people’s lives. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis. Its prevalence and incidence are increasing, owing to population ageing and rising rates of comorbidity and obesity. Gout causes excruciating flares of joint pain and swelling, long\-term joint damage and impaired health\-related quality of life \(HRQOL\). It is well\-understood, yet management is frequently suboptimal. 

  

 Based in Keele’s Primary Care Centre Versus Arthritis, our gout research group was established in 2008 and published its first research paper in 2010. Led by Roddy \(rheumatologist\) our multidisciplinary team combines expertise in general practice \(Mallen, Clarson\), nursing \(Finney\), dietetics \(Watson\), quantitative \(Muller, Bucknall, Bajpai, Whittle\) and qualitative \(Richardson, Liddle\) methods, and the patient and public’s perspective, to undertake high\-quality randomised trials, epidemiological and qualitative studies with the aim of improving the management of gout in primary care. Patients and members of the public have helped us to prioritise research questions, design studies \(informing, for example, recruitment methods, eligibility criteria, choice of outcomes\), and oversee research through Trial Steering Committee membership. 

 We described rising prevalence and incidence of gout in the UK between 1997 and 2012 \( **3.1**\). Prevalence peaked at 2.5% in 2012 but suboptimal management persisted, with only 40% of patients receiving definitive treatment with allopurinol throughout this period. 

 We undertook a qualitative interview study to explore people’s experience of having gout and identify the issues relating to the causes, diagnosis, and treatment that are important to them. We found that patients’ lack of confidence in and resistance to the diagnosis of gout occurred in response to their misconceptions about its causes and perceived characteristics of gout sufferers \( **3.2**\). Patients and the public may be unaware that gout is a chronic condition requiring long\-term treatment, perpetuating suboptimal management. 

 Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink \(CPRD\), we have identified novel, important associations between gout and comorbidities such as vascular disease, sleep disorders, venous thromboembolism and sexual dysfunction. We undertook a large cohort study in CPRD, finding that both men and women with gout are at increased risk of vascular events but risk is greater in women than men \( **3.3**\). We have shown the burden of chronic kidney disease \(CKD\) in patients with gout, 24% of people with gout have CKD and the risk of CKD in people with gout is over twice that of the general population \( **3.4**\). This has led to work demonstrating distinct comorbidity clusters in people with gout. 

 We performed a systematic review to describe the impact of gout on HRQOL \( **3.5**\). We found that although both gout and coexisting health conditions contribute to poor HRQOL; gout is associated with impaired HRQOL even after adjusting for these other conditions. 

 We led the CONTACT trial which is the largest\-ever gout flare trial undertaken in primary care \(399 participants from 100 general practices\) and the first direct head\-to\-head comparison of a non\-steroidal anti\-inflammatory drug \(naproxen\) and colchicine, the most common drug treatments for gout flares \( **3.6**\).  We showed no difference between naproxen and colchicine for pain, but found naproxen was associated with less use of analgesics, fewer side\-effects and was more cost\-effective.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Impact on updated national and international gout management guidelines** 

 Our research features in national and international guidelines \( **5.1, 5.2, 5.3**\). The rising prevalence and incidence of gout \( **3.1**\) was cited as key justification for the updated 2016 European League Against Rheumatism \(EULAR\) recommendations \(co\-author Mallen\) and 2017 British Society for Rheumatology \(BSR\) guidelines \(lead Roddy, co\-author Mallen\) \( **5.1, 5.2**\). Our work demonstrating increased cardiovascular risk in people with gout \( **3.3**\) underpinned the EULAR recommendations’ overarching principle that every person with gout should be screened for associated comorbidities and cardiovascular risk \( **5.1**\). Our systematic review highlighting the prevalence of chronic kidney disease \(CKD\) in people with gout \( **3.4**\) was cited in the BSR guideline to support including a specific section dedicated to treating gout in patients with CKD, given the challenges of managing these patients \( **5.2**\). A key change in these guidelines from earlier versions was a shift to recommend earlier commencement of definitive pharmacological urate\-lowering therapy \( **5.1, 5.2**\). Both guidelines cited our systematic review of the impact of gout on quality of life \( **3.5**\) as key evidence underpinning this shift. The CONTACT trial \( **3.6**\) was included in the systematic review and network meta\-analysis which informed the recommendation in the American College of Rheumatology 2020 guideline that NSAIDs and colchicine are appropriate first\-line therapy for gout flares \( **5.3**\). 

 The updated EULAR recommendations and BSR guidelines were both cited in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) Gout Clinical Knowledge Summary 2018 \( **5.4**\). The BSR guideline was accredited by NICE and endorsed by the Royal College of General Practitioners \( **5.2**\). It was included in the journal *Rheumatology*’s “Best of 2017” as one its five most downloaded papers in 2017 \(viewed online >5200 times in the first 12 months following publication\) \( **5.5**\) and voted the 4<sup>th</sup> most useful, interesting, or practice\-changing paper from 2017 by Red Whale, a leading provider of UK primary care medical education \( **5.6**\). 

 **Impact on international expert consensus on gout terminology and disease labels** 

 Lack of clarity regarding the communication of disease\-related concepts in clinical settings identified by our qualitative study \( **3.2**\) was cited as key justification for a recent international consensus exercise involving 79 experts in gout from 22 countries, led by the international, multidisciplinary, collaborative Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal\-Associated Disease Network \(G\-CAN\) network to agree terminology for gout disease states, published in 2019 \( **5.7**\). 

 **Understanding patients’ experiences of gout** 

 Prior to merging with Arthritis Research UK to form Versus Arthritis, Arthritis Care was the UK’s largest organisation working with and for people with arthritis. In 2014, it undertook a large survey of people’s experiences of having gout \(co\-authors Roddy, Mallen\). Our research \( **3.1**\) was cited prominently in the resulting Gout Nation report \( **5.8**\), inspiring Arthritis Care’s Gout Awareness month in 2015. 

 **Developing freely accessible patient\-facing material** 

 We worked with patients and members of the public to develop patient\-facing educational materials about gout to support patients, carers and healthcare professionals. Healthtalk.org is managed by Oxford\-based Dipex Charity, whose mission is to help and inform patients, carers and healthcare professionals by sharing freely accessible, personal, real\-life health experiences. Published in 2014, the content of our online healthtalk gout resource arose directly from our qualitative research \( **3.2**\) and has been viewed 428,016 times since going live in 2014 with positive public comments and feedback through the webpages \(personal correspondence from Dipex, June 2020\). The gout videos are viewed around 4,000 times per month \( **5.9**\). 

 **Developing the Multidisciplinary Workforce Internationally** 

 As lead author of the Crystal Arthropathy module of the EULAR on\-line course, Roddy has implemented our research describing gout’s rising prevalence and incidence: its impact on quality of life was cited to emphasise the burden posed by gout \( **3.1, 3.5**\).  The module targets knowledge and skills to suit the final years of rheumatology training \( **5.10**\) and has been accessed by 1540 students since 2016. 

 Inspired by our paper describing suboptimal management of gout \( **3.1**\), our local Clinical Commissioning Group’s Practice Nurse evidence\-based practice group investigated the benefits of nurse\-led gout consultations as a Critically Appraised Topic and audited management of gout across six local practices. After identifying sub\-optimal practice, current guidelines were circulated to over 200 practice nurses at 134 practices across North Staffordshire and South Cheshire. The BSR guidelines were also shared on a dedicated website for the group. Subsequently, 30 primary care nurses have opted for additional gout training to improve their practice and expressed interest in participating in a randomised trial of nurse\-led gout care.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Boron Neutron Capture Therapy \(BNCT\) has become a viable treatment option for the most aggressive cancers, with impact on **global commerce and the economy**, and on **patient outcomes**, because of our research. We directly contributed to **innovation and commercial activity** at the international medical equipment company, Neutron Therapeutics, which **developed a major new product** \(a clinical BNCT facility\). We provided companies with the confidence to **invest in and adopt** **new clinical BNCT technology**, indirectly **reducing risk** for the Japanese company, Cancer Intelligence Care Systems \(¥5 billion investment\) and influencing the **strategic investment** \($70 million\) of the multi\-national company, TAE Life Sciences, to expand its business into BNCT therapeutics. **BNCT has been approved as a treatment option** for recurrent head and neck cancers in Japan. It not only **improves patient survival** but also requires **less treatment time at lower cost** than other advanced forms of radiotherapy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Our research was the first to produce a clinically suitable treatment beam using an accelerator for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy \(BNCT\), a step\-change in the field. 

###  *Developing BNCT to safely treat glioblastoma multiforme, and head and neck cancers* 

 The potential of BNCT to treat otherwise incurable cancers has been understood for decades, but was never practical until our breakthroughs. Effective treatment depends on the interaction of a non\-toxic boron\-containing drug, which is selectively absorbed by cancerous cells, and a neutron beam. The challenge we faced was that only a nuclear reactor could produce the neutron beam. This was too expensive and hazardous to install in a hospital. Moreover, the beam it produced could contain high\-energy neutrons that might have damaging side effects. To make BNCT practical, the beam would need to be instead produced by a particle accelerator. 

 This presented **2 significant challenges, both of which we overcame**. 

####  **Key finding 1 \[KF1\]: Producing a safe and practical lithium target** 

 First, to produce a neutron field, we must fire protons at a lithium ‘target’. However, this produces heat that would melt the lithium if not controlled. Bonding the lithium with copper allows heat to conduct through the copper to water. This requires the lithium and copper to stay bonded under the powerful heating caused by proton bombardment. 

 We developed a new and powerful technique to achieve effective bonding of the lithium and copper and in 2004 demonstrated its effectiveness \[S1\]. The image below shows sections through an un\-treated Li\-Cu junction on the left and on the right a typical bond that our process achieves. Here lithium \(on the right half of the right image\) has partially diffused into the copper \(on the left\). This forms a strong bond which allows heat to be removed from the lithium while it remains solid under proton beam powers of approximately 3–4kW. **Before our work, this was widely viewed as an extraordinarily challenging problem that might never be solved.** 

 Image 1: L showing the untreated Li\-Cu junction; R showing Li\-Cu diffusion after treatment. 

####  **Key finding 2 \[KF2\]: Developing a sufficiently intense and less contaminated narrow spectrum neutron beam for clinical application** 

 Secondly, having produced a neutron field, we converted it into a beam suitable for treating patients, using what is termed a Beam Shaping Assembly \(BSA\). The combination of accelerator and BSA can be used to produce a narrower spectrum neutron beam, reducing unwanted high\-energy neutrons that would otherwise damage the patient. 

 In 2003/4, **we demonstrated for the first time that this combination of equipment would produce clinically usable dose\-rates** \[S1\]. We showed how the target and BSA had worked reliably over a period of months to allow characterisation of the beam by both physical dosimetry and a limited programme of cell radiobiology. This paper \[S1\] brings together our work to demonstrate performance of the lithium target and of the characteristics of the radiation field for patient treatment. 

####  **Key finding 3 \[KF3\]: Demonstrating greater protection for healthy tissues using the accelerator beam** 

 Finally, we developed an improved understanding of the biological consequences of the mixed radiation field delivered during BNCT treatment. This work demonstrated that the components of a mixed radiation field undergo a synergistic interaction that produces a greater cell kill effect than would be anticipated from the independent action of the different radiation types \[S2\]. We also demonstrated the **reduced biological effects of our accelerator beam** compared with the established Studsvik reactor beam for BNCT which had previously been used for patient trials \[S3\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Four international companies are now **producing accelerator\-based BNCT equipment** as a direct consequence of our key findings \(Neutron Therapeutics, Cancer Intelligence Care Systems \(CICS\), TAE Life Sciences and Sumitomo Heavy Engineering\). This has led to **economic and commercial impact** of 2 distinct types: \(1\) **innovation and new product development** at international medical equipment companies \(clinical BNCT facilities\); and \(2\) the **adoption of** and investment in **new BNCT** **technologies** at facilities around the world. The significance of these developments is further attested by the demonstrable **improvement in patient outcomes** shown in multiple clinical trials internationally. 

###  *1\) Enabling the development of a new product, a fully formed and bespoke clinical BNCT facility, by international medical equipment companies* 

 The medical equipment company, Neutron Therapeutics, **developed a clinical BNCT facility as its main commercial product** using the specific lithium\-copper bonding approach that we developed \[KF1\] in its manufacturing process. Its prototype has been demonstrated at 10s of kW of proton beam power for hundreds of hours run time with no degradation. Neutron Therapeutics’ Chief Operating Officer asserted that “The Birmingham team solved th\[e\] problem \[of physical and thermal bonding of the lithium layer to a suitable substrate\] for a copper target backing material and **we have followed this approach for our commercial product**. It is a critical aspect of our system and under\-pins the success of our product” \[E1\]. 

 The Tokyo\-based company CICS is a major partner in the **creation of a new BNCT facility**, using a safe lithium target design, at the National Cancer Centre \(NCC\) in Tokyo, Japan. The NCC is the largest specialist cancer treatment hospital in Japan and spearheads standardising cancer treatment in the country. Our demonstration that the neutron beam produced by a proton beam hitting a lithium target reduced damaging side effects \[KF3\] materially contributed to CICS’s adoption of the lithium target technology to create the facility. Its President and CMO commented that these benefits “convinced us that the choice of a lithium target was the right one for our project” \[E2\], significantly **influencing the commercial activity** and **strategic direction** of the company. 

 The development of these BNCT facilities are materially dependant on the work of the University of Birmingham team, whose research \[KF1, KF2\] gave the funders confidence such that, since 2012, the NCC BNCT project has received extensive and sustained investment. It took CICS 8 years to build the equipment prototype CICS\-1, at a cost of ¥2 billion, and our research \[KF1 and KF2\] served specifically to **ensure stakeholder confidence** and reassure investors that the final goal was achievable. CICS confirmed that our research **reduced its financial risks**: “The achievements of the team in Birmingham to produce a functioning BNCT system with a lithium target were critical for our project. They enabled us to provide the reassurance that our stakeholders required” \[E2\]. To date the **NCC has spent ¥5 billion** on the building construction and **BNCT equipment**. Following the success of the NCC BNCT project, CICS will deliver a second BNCT facility for Edogawa Hospital, Tokyo in March 2021. 

###  *2\) Through the use of BNCT, new clinical technologies, in the form of new therapies, were developed* 

 We have contributed to **innovation within the international BNCT community**, which has used our pioneering research findings \[KF1–KF3\] to **develop BNCT therapies**, with excellent efficacy. In addition to Neutron Therapeutics, which uses our specific lithium\-copper bonding approach \[KF1\], three companies, TAE Life Sciences, Cancer Intelligence Care Systems \(CICS\) and Sumitomo Heavy Engineering, **developed BNCT technology only after we had demonstrated that accelerator\-BNCT was possible**. Indeed, our research was described by the President of the International Society for Neutron Capture Therapy as “crucial in enabling BNCT as a medical therapy for incurable cancers. Motivated and inspired by \(our\) research, new accelerator projects have been initiated in Japan, Europe and around the World” \[E3\]. 

 The Boston\-based company Neutron Therapeutics, established in 2014, uses our lithium\-copper bonding technique \[KF1\]. The company employs 25 people. In 2019, their **first full clinical system was commissioned** by the Helsinki University Hospital team to initially treat patients with recurrent head and neck cancers. The facility has the capacity to treat up to 2,000 patients per year. A second system will be deployed at Shonan Kamakura General Hospital in Kanagawa, Japan, in 2021. The approximate value of each clinical facility is $25 million. In 2020, Neutron Therapeutics received an additional order for an accelerator neutron source for research in the UK \[E1\]. 

 Our ability to demonstrate the feasibility of BNCT as a viable clinical treatment \[KF1 and KF2\] impacted the **commercial opportunities and investment strategy** of the multi\-national company, TAE Life Sciences. TAE Life Sciences **raised $70 million** in funding to launch a subsidiary of the nuclear fusion energy company TAE Technologies in 2018 \[E4, E5\]. This significant strategic investment aims to commercialise BNCT with its accelerator\-based technology, making neutrons for BNCT more accessible in hospitals and hence indirectly providing better treatment for patients with incurable cancers \[E4\]. The company is supplying equipment to the NeuBoron facility at Xiamen Humanity Hospital in China. Construction of this facility is nearing completion and accelerator equipment is currently being installed. It will treat the first patients in 2021. In total, 14 facilities are in development or at clinical trial stage, in 8 counties around the world \[E6\]. 

 **New therapies are being developed using the new BNCT clinical facilities**, in which CICS has invested, exploring new indications for BNCT \[KF1–KF3\]. These include sarcoma, malignant melanoma and pleural mesothelioma \[E2\]. Because of the low toxicity of the lithium target neutron beam, the CICS team are actively exploring the use of BNCT in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The President and CMO commented that “I am deeply grateful to Professor Green’s prototype for guiding our developments” \[E2\]. 

 The Japanese company Sumitomo Heavy Industries has also invested in BNCT facilities for therapeutic purposes, at Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute and 2 treatment rooms each at the Southern Tohoku General Hospital \(Koriyama\) and Osaka Medical College. In March 2020, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare **approved the Sumitomo accelerator system of BNCT** as a treatment for patients with recurrent head and neck cancers \[E7\]. 

###  *3\) Demonstrable improvements in patient outcomes, treatment time and costs* 

 The **efficacy of BNCT has been demonstrated** by multiple clinical studies by research teams internationally. The benefits of BNCT take 3 forms: the first is **improved patient survival** \(points i–iii, below\), the second is **reduced toxicity** \(point iv\) and the third is reduced treatment time and consequently costs \(point v\). 

 **i\) Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme:** These brain tumours are both radio\-resistant and highly infiltrating, and while the incidence is relatively low \(around 4,500 cases per year in the UK\), poor outcomes mean that it results in the most years of life lost of any single tumour type. Clinical results from Japan show that patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme treated with **BNCT could achieve a 2\-year survival rate of 50% compared to \~30% for the best available conventional treatments** \[E8\]. By extension, if all the \~4,500 cases per year in Britain were treated with BNCT, it would raise the number of patients alive at 2 years from \~1,350 \(with conventional treatments\) to 2,250. This can be extrapolated to the annual global incidence of \~200,000. 

 **ii\) Patients with glioblastoma multiforme that has recurred after first\-line treatment has failed:** For patients where the disease recurs and where patients are fit enough for a second\-line treatment, recent data presented by a team in Japan suggests that survival at 1 year following **BNCT** **treatment with an accelerator neutron source could approach 80% \(compared with an expectation of \~35% with standard approaches\)** \[E9\]. This is a huge difference. 

 **iii\) Patients with head and neck cancers that have recurred after first\-line treatment has failed:** In the UK, around 12,000 patients are diagnosed with head and neck cancers each year and \~45% of these will suffer a relapse within 5 years of treatment. Conventional treatments are often so toxic that clinicians are reluctant to repeat them and so offer patients only palliative treatment and pain relief. In some regions of China, the incidence of these cancers is dramatically higher than in the UK. Trial data from Helsinki \[E10\] has inspired many centres, including a number of those above, to pursue BNCT. Further analysis from the Helsinki team, published in 2019 showed **\~46% of patients with recurrent cancers in the head and neck to have survived 2 years following BNCT treatment and over 20% surviving 5 years** \[E11\]. 

 **iv\) Reduced toxicity:** Unlike many existing treatments, BNCT shows both good disease control and low toxicity for patients with head and neck cancers. That means that BNCT can be used safely following intensive first\-line treatment and can even be repeated multiple times should the disease recur \(Kato *et al*. where BNCT treatment was repeated 3 times for 1 patient \[E12\]\). Accelerator BNCT is even less damaging to healthy tissues \[KF3\] than is demonstrated in these studies which are based on neutron beams from nuclear reactors. 

 **v\) Reducing treatment time and costs:** The overall **benefits of using BNCT over conventional proton radiotherapy treatments** are considerable. A single BNCT treatment room costs the same as a single\-room proton radiotherapy facility \(approximately $25 million\), but can treat substantially more patients. Patients undergoing BNCT only require 1 or 2 or treatment sessions \(as opposed to between 5 and 30 for proton radiotherapy\) and each session only takes between 20 and 30 minutes. This means that each facility has the **capacity to treat at least \~6 times more patients per year**, \~2,000 in total \[E1\]. **This simultaneously cuts capital\-cost\-per\-patient significantly and provides better clinical outcomes** than are possible with protons. Neutron Therapeutics confirmed that “\[i\]t is our view that this cost\-effectiveness, combined with the potential to improve outcomes for patients, will lead to a significant expansion in BNCT treatment capacity in the coming years” \[E1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Unregulated harvesting of wildmeat \(bushmeat\) undermines rural food security and devastates wildlife and ecosystem function in the tropics. Stirling research has underpinned extensive reform of wildmeat harvest and trade to improve sustainability in Gabon, a high biodiversity country, home to the world’s largest remaining populations of forest elephants, giant pangolins, and mandrills. 

 **Impact 1.** Stirling research led to **new laws** in Gabon that allow subsistence use of resilient game species, enhancing the livelihoods of the entire rural population of 250,000 reliant on wildmeat, and reducing biodiversity loss. Stirling expertise allowed the government to test regulation of local trade in pilot areas from 2018. The **food security of 8%** of rural people has already been improved through the new practices, extending to the entire population of Gabon \(2,200,000\) by 2024. 

 **Impact 2.** Acting on research showing dramatic wildlife losses to unregulated hunting, **new wildlife protection regulations** significantly increased protection for 11 endangered species considered overexploited \(e.g. pangolins, elephants\), and improved **wildlife monitoring** is now mandatory for >50% of the country’s area. Pangolin hunting has declined and elephant numbers are increasing in some protected areas. Research also prompted the introduction of a new Penal Code **increasing penalties for wildlife crimes**, particularly those impacting sustainability. 

 
**Impact 3.** Stirling research showed, for the first time, that species with high risk of zoonotic disease transmission \(bats, pangolins, primates\) were living in close proximity in the wild. Trade in these species has now been **banned** in Gabon, leading to further **wildlife protection** and a **reduced direct human\-health risk** for over 1,000,000 wildmeat consumers, and ultimately the entire population.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 In 2003 Stirling participated in novel research showing that subsistence hunting had become unsustainable across the tropics, driving declines in wildlife, particularly populations of large, endangered species, and jeopardising rural food security \( [DOI:10.1038/nature01566 and 10.1016/S0169\-5347\(03\)00123\-X](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00123-X)\). To support the government of Gabon to address these problems, Stirling researchers went on to lead novel, large\-scale research on consumption and use of wildlife and to elucidate the socio\-economic drivers of hunting and trade. This was done through a repeated national survey of consumption in >1000 households, trade in 16 markets over 6 years and long\-term hunter follows in 12 villages \(R1, R2\). Results showed, for the first time, that the largest volumes of hunted meat are destined for urban wealthy, not food\-insecure rural people \(R1\) and that revenues from hunting sales are important in >70% of rural livelihoods \(R1, R2\). Continued overhunting causes eventual wildlife collapse followed by local economic failure and exodus, leading to profound social change in rural communities \(R2 and   [http://hdl.handle.net/1893/28635](http://hdl.handle.net/1893/28635)\). Prior to wildlife collapse, families who hunt the most are the biggest short\-term losers under rural trade regulation \(R2\) and resist such measures. Rich families, able to afford high prices, are undeterred by low penalties and perpetuate the trade via underground sales. Solutions are therefore socially intractable. A comprehensive 2015 International Union for the Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\) report citing previous Stirling research \( [https://doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.CH.2015.01.en](https://doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.CH.2015.01.en)\) concluded that alternative livelihood provisions had largely failed. 

 To support innovation in management strategies, in 2015 Stirling researchers built and populated the first accessible evidence\-base for informed management across Central Africa \(R3\). This went on to become the online WILDMEAT database used to provide assessments of the effects on wildlife of prolonged or changing hunting pressure \(R4\). Following researcher presentations to national consultations on hunting management and Stirling research briefs submitted to the CITES Head of Delegation \(2016\) and the Minister responsible for Wildlife, rapid legal and policy reforms were enacted for species endangered by illegal use \[C1\-8\]. Stirling also provided direct evidence to government on the contribution of hunting and trade incomes to families across the country \(R1, R2\). This enabled modelling of how different regulatory scenarios may affect stakeholders for the optimisation of management strategies \(R5\). A systematic review and analysis of the wildmeat sector, commissioned by the Convention on Biological Diversity \(CBD\) following **Decision XIII/8 \(C9a,b\)** brought Stirling researchers together with other leaders in the field to author new guidance and theories of change for use in governance strategies \(i.e. R5\). The CBD Secretariat encourages all 193 Parties to use this 2019 Guidance document to support policies to improve sustainable wildlife use \(C9b\). 

 Stirling’s most recent research, funded by the 2019\-2024 UKRI GCRF Trade, Development and the Environment Hub, responds to public demand to identify \(R6\) and manage the risk of zoonotic disease transmission in the light of the recent global zoonotic pandemic. Stirling research considers how economic shock can affect sustainable wildlife use in Africa and offers mitigation scenarios to policy\-makers \(R5\). This research was used in Gabon in the 2020 pandemic\-response decision to ban the hunting and use of some species deemed high\-risk for zoonotic disease emergence \(C1b\). 

 All research outputs are delivered to decision\-makers via carefully planned pathways to impact, developed over the past 20 years and curated to remain relevant and persuasive \(i.e. C5, C8a,b, C9 a\-f\). Abernethy is a member of the Gabon Expert Group of the National Strategy for Bushmeat Management, sits on the Advisory Board for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Urban Bushmeat Initiative, is an advisor to the Gabon National Parks Agency Science Unit, and provides technical advice on assessment of use of wildlife resources to the EU Sustainable Wildlife Management project, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the African Conservation Development Group.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 University of Stirling research has been vital in understanding the unsustainability of the wildmeat trade in Gabon and proposing solutions that have been carried through into policy and practice. Trade of hunted wildlife generates much\-needed subsistence income for >70% of Gabon’s rural families \(approximately 250,000 people; R1, R2\). However, many hunted species, including endangered species such as elephants and pangolins, are now in serious decline \(i.e. R4\). Economic growth has increased demand from wealthy urban centres driving severe overhunting that threatens rural livelihoods, food security, and social stability. Ebola, SARS, and COVID\-19 outbreaks have exposed the urgent need to control the risk of zoonotic diseases emerging from the wildmeat trade. Gabon faces a societal problem of balancing economic development, rural food security, public safety, and the conservation of globally endangered wildlife. Stirling research has helped Gabon to tackle these challenges and to secure environmentally and socially sustainable outcomes. National Geographic now lists Gabon as one of the  [top 8 most sustainable destinations in the world in 2020](https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/travel/2020/11/best-of-the-world-2021-sustainability). 

 *Pathway to Impact:* Following initial research which framed the problem, Stirling and the Gabon Ministry of Forests’ Wildlife Department secured Darwin Initiative funding \(2003\-2009\) for joint research. This led to training of 15 research\-active staff, joint publications \(R1 and  [others](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10745-006-9025-1)\) and the development of a first national database which gave stakeholders a research evidence\-base \(R3\). The project organised a cross\-government workshop in 2007 to examine the adequacy of hunting laws for sustaining subsistence food security. This resulted in a Minister of Forests’ declaration to the Cabinet on the need for legal reform and better governance. Following this call, the Director of Forests commissioned a full report on the wildmeat sector, co\-authored by Stirling and citing 10 Stirling research papers. This report was then used at inter\-ministerial level to initiate development of a National Strategy for Bushmeat Management. In 2008 the Convention on Biodiversity also commissioned a first Technical Report questioning the sustainability of wildlife hunting in the tropics, co\-authored by Stirling and citing 2 Stirling papers in evidence of unsustainability. 

 **Impact 1: Improved food security for around 250,000 people in subsistence livelihoods** 

 The research\-led approach pioneered by Stirling’s collaboration with the Gabonese government for improved hunting management \(R1\-3, R6, C2c, C5\-8\) led, in 2018, to Gabon testing new regulatory approaches in the field \(C6a\) with funding from the European Union ‘Sustainable Wildlife Management’ programme \(C6b\). The stated objective of the EUR44,000,000 global programme is to ‘Contribute to wildlife conservation and the protection of ecosystem services alongside amelioration of the quality of life and food security of the populations who depend on these resources’, exactly mirroring the National Strategy set out in the 2010 technical report co\-produced by the Gabon Ministry and University of Stirling \(C8b\) upon which Gabon’s political approach to wild meat management is now based \(C6a, C8a\). 

 Using Stirling research methods for measuring consumption \(R1\-3\), pilot sustainable bushmeat management programmes were put into effect in 2019 to **monitor** **the food security of 8% of Gabon’s rural population** \(approximately 20,000 people\). In 2020, the pilot project reported the proportion of rural families’ protein consumption that was wildmeat was a maximum of 22% in the most remote villages; a drop of approximately 15% from previous figures \(R1, C6a\): Evidence of a reduced reliance on wildlife and improved access to other proteins that has improved overall food security. By 2024, evidence\-based reforms built from this initiative will affect the wildlife use of the entire population of Gabon; approximately 2,200,000 people \(C6a\). 

 The research designs and methods for monitoring used in the pilot programmes are housed in the Stirling co\-created online open\-access  [WILDMEAT database](http://www.wildmeat.org/) \(C10\). The data will ultimately be openly available here also. The Government research agency in Gabon now collaborates with Stirling to monitor consumption in a further 1,000 households, with direct funding from UKRI GCRF Trade, Development and the Environment Hub. **Gabon’s Environment Minister states “ **Stirling’s research has been key to our strategies for sustainable hunting. To balance food security and wildlife conservation is complex and requires robust evidence for decision\-making. Their research showing the scale of urban demand \[..\] changed the way we think about management. Stirling are our primary research partner in building and monitoring sustainable harvesting policies**”** \(C6a\). 

 **Impact 2:** **New national and international protection for endangered wildlife species** 

 Stirling research on the scale of hunting impacts on wildlife \(R2\-4\) stimulated a national wildlife monitoring programme \(C4\). Biomonitoring using Stirling methodologies is now deployed in the Gabon National Parks which cover 3 million ha \(11%\) of the country \(C5\) and becomes obligatory in timber concessions covering a further 14 million ha \(52%\), in 2021. Mr Christian Tchemambela, Head of the National Parks Agency, confirms that no other African rainforest country has such a programme and that Stirling research has been critical in Gabon’s programme: “ *Stirling showed us the impacts of hunting on all biodiversity and the need for a wildlife monitoring system to improve our management strategies. Thanks to their biomonitoring methods, we have been able to improve our wildlife monitoring in the parks and therefore increase protection. We can demonstrate an increase in wildlife populations in some parks*” \(C5\). Responding to Stirling research evidence on the detriment to rural societies of heavy biodiversity loss \(R2 and others\), the new 2019 Penal Code has significantly increased punishments for crimes reducing wildlife sustainability \(C3, p136, C6a\). Organised wildlife poaching now carries a sentence of 15 years imprisonment and penalties for hunting endangered species have increased from 6\-month to 10\-year maximum sentences. Using Stirling research \(R4,  [DOI:10.1111/aje.12507](https://doi.org/10.1111/aje.12507)\), on pangolins, which are particularly heavily hunted, Gabon’s delegation co\-led the 2016 Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species \(CITES\) 17<sup>th</sup> Conference of Parties \(CoP17\) Decision 17.239 to **include all African pangolins in Appendix I** \(which lists the most endangered species\) \(C2, C7\). This listing **prohibits international trade in all 4 African pangolins**; now crucial as African pangolins represent the largest source for the international market, which has already driven Asian species to critical endangerment \(see  [UNODC, Wildlife Crime: Pangolin scales, 2020](http://www.unodc.org/documents/wwcr/2020/Wildlife_crime_Pangolin_UNODC.pdf)\). Dr Koumba Pambo, head of the Gabon CITES Scientific Authority, qualifies that Stirling research is “ *driving our agenda on combatting wildlife overhunting, particularly their work showing how international trade is implicated. Our approach to pangolin conservation is now widely acclaimed”* \(C7\). 

 **Impact 3: New laws to reduce public health risk from novel zoonotic disease transmission** 

 New Stirling research in 2020 showed that high\-risk species contact each other in the wild \(R6\), that these species are regularly hunted and consumed \(R1, R2, R4\) and that the COVID economic shock could increase contact between wildlife and humans \(R5\). This evidence underpinned **Gabon’s 2020 decision to prohibit domestic trade in pangolins, bats, and primates** \(C6a, C1b\) and to include public health concerns in the 2020 Protected Species by\-laws \(C1a,b\), legally binding the country to better safeguards against zoonotic disease emergence from the wildlife trade. This legislation reduced pangolin consumption \(C1c\) and directly benefits public health in the whole population of 2,200,000 people.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Stirling has led the way on understanding the previously underexplored globalised aspects of Gothic cultural aesthetics. Our research into the socio\-economic and cultural aesthetics of the Gothic led to a collaboration with the British Library \(BL\) on the exhibition ‘Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination’ \(2014\-15\), which resulted in a new visitor experience at the BL, significantly increased visitor numbers, and exceeded target income at the BL. The exhibit attracted the highest number of visitors for a BL exhibit running over 16 weeks. The exhibition also caused a change in practice at Gothic\-related heritage sites, with increased incorporation of research into cultural heritage activities. This impact was directly related to the AHRC network ‘Global Gothic’ \(2008\-09\) and the AHRC award ‘Writing Britain's Ruins, 1700\-1850: The Architectural Imagination’ \(2014\-17\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research for this project, Global Gothic, was undertaken by Glennis Byron and the AHRC Principal Investigator Dale Townshend in his research project ‘Writing Britain’s Ruins’, and exploited in ‘Tropical Gothic’ by Justin D Edwards and Peter Lindfield. From 2000 to 2013, Byron undertook pioneering work on the international cultural influence of Gothic aesthetics, disseminated in the edited volume *Globalgothic* \(2013\) \( **R1**\). Byron’s work is part of a new wave of Gothic Studies that has aimed to recast the debate about Gothic aesthetics beyond the Anglophone context. Byron and others have investigated the socio\-economic and cultural impact of Gothic from an international perspective. ‘In the late twentieth and early twenty\-first centuries gothic has progressed far beyond being fixed in terms of any one geographically conscribed mode’ and has developed alongside an ‘increasingly integrated global economy’ \( **R1**\). Byron focusses particularly on how globalisation has affected transnational Gothic production and popularity. 

 Townshend and Edwards were on the advisory board and participants in Byron’s Gothic network grant and they further investigated the international dimensions of Gothic from a multi\-disciplinary perspective. Townshend and Byron co\-edited the book *The Gothic World* \(2014\) \( **R2**\), a collection of essays encompassing new directions in cultural production and critical debates in Gothic. The collection draws together contributions from leading academics in history, architecture, music, fashion, film, new media and literature. Similarly, Edwards co\-edited *Tropical Gothic in Literature and Culture* \(2016\) \( **R3**\), which was developed out of papers presented at the International Gothic Conference \(2013\), and examines how Gothic adapts to different geographical locations by thriving upon local popular culture through transculturation and tropicalisation. The findings of this research documented the transnational interventions of the Gothic by mapping the flows of Gothic forms across borders and geographical regions to tease out the complexities of Gothic cultural production within cultural and linguistic translations. The research underpinning the impact evidenced the ubiquity of Gothic forms, modes and aesthetics across nations and continents. 

 The British Library exhibition ‘Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination’ drew directly on the research of Byron, Townshend and Edwards, and thus in itself provided a new research model for how humanities can inform public engagement with large\-scale exhibitions. As described in section 4 below, Townshend acted as a research advisor for every aspect of the ‘Terror and Wonder’ BL exhibition. This project also generated new findings, including the book publication of *Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination* \(2014\) \( **R4**\) edited by Townshend. Edwards builds on Townshend’s work by revealing how the Gothic aesthetic is perceived across regional, linguistic and national borders. Edwards recounted the research findings of this process of translating cultural research into public engagement in an article published on the open access Gothic Imagination website.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The British Library \(BL\) benefited from the cultural and financial impact of the largest and most comprehensive Gothic exhibition, ‘Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination’, to take place in a public institution worldwide. This impact on visitor experience at the BL was based on University of Stirling research that was funded by two AHRC grants that ran during two periods \(2008\-09 and 2014\-15\). 

 The link between the research and the BL had two aims: to apply cultural research to inform an exciting new interpretation of Gothic history through a major exhibit at the BL, and to strengthen the connections and consensus between public understanding of the history of Gothic aesthetics 

and the academic community. In achieving these aims, the collaboration offered a pioneering model for the application of humanities research – literary, historical and cultural – to an exhibit that improved the BL’s financial position and its engagement with the public. ‘Terror and Wonder’ included visual and textual media, displayed many rare manuscripts and editions, presented unique film and video footage, exhibited original visual art, photographs and clothing, so that visitors engaged with and understood the many aspects of the history of Gothic aesthetics from the 18<sup>th</sup> century to the present \(see BL description and promotional video:  [<ins>https://www.bl.uk/events/terror\-and\-wonder\-\-the\-gothic\-imagination</ins>](https://www.bl.uk/events/terror-and-wonder--the-gothic-imagination)\). 

 Figure 1. 'Terror and Wonder' BL Exhibit Promotional Image 

This new visitor experience immersed members of the public in the many facets of Gothic aesthetics \(literary, cinematic, artistic, photographic, architectural\) drawn directly from the models explored in Byron’s work and furthered by Townshend’s and Edwards’s research. 

 In the course of this project, Edwards contributed as a consultant, while Townshend wrote text for various media, advised on the design and layout of the exhibition, selected works for inclusion, and briefed staff on research findings. Townshend conducted original cultural research to inform the new aesthetic history of Gothic, and also translated his research into text for exhibition placards, the exhibit’s website and promotional material, as well as editing the exhibition catalogue *Terror and Wonder: The Gothic Imagination* \( **R4**\). His findings about the history of Gothic aesthetics enabled the first large\-scale presentation of Gothic production across a range of media and periods that immersed visitors in various forms of representation and key debates. He also delivered historical briefings for exhibition guides and promoted the exhibit through the opening reception and radio appearances \( **S1**\). 

 The launch of the ‘Terror and Wonder’ exhibit in October 2014 and the accompanying media and promotional activities helped the BL to achieve its goal of stabilising income streams for its exhibition space through increased visitors. The BL exceeded target ticket sales by 18.3% and decided to add 24 extra slots in the final two weeks of the exhibition to satisfy visitor demand. During the period of the exhibition \(3 Oct 2014 to 20 Jan 2015\), the target number of visitors and tickets sales was 50,036; the actual number of visitors and tickets taken was 59,198 \( **S2**\). 

 In addition to attracting new audiences, the unique exhibit enhanced public awareness of the history of Gothic and informed public opinion about the meanings of Gothic aesthetics. *Time Out* named ‘Terror and Wonder’ as one of its top 10 things to do for Halloween 2014 and, according to *The Guardian*, it ‘teems with arresting exhibits’, offering an original perspective that conveys an ‘epic journey through a literary genre and its endless cultural transformations’ \( **S3\(a\) & \(b\)**\). A visitor commented that it ‘transformed my understanding of gothic’, while another said ‘I saw stuff I didn’t know existed in the history of gothic’ \( **S4**\). The level of awareness in approaching Gothic from this new perspective was increased by the daily Learning Workshops for pre\-HE students. Over 8,000 post\-secondary students participated in workshops led by exhibition staff who were informed and advised by the research underpinning the exhibit \( **S2**\). The high number of visitors translated into other new public exhibitions and public lectures involving researchers at Stirling on Gothic, specifically at Strawberry Hill House and The Old Operating Theatre \(see below\). This public response indicates the importance of quality, research\-based interpretation for increasing visitor numbers in public exhibition spaces, and it is evidence that academic research into Gothic can enhance and transform public understanding of the history of Gothic cultural production. 

 The second aim of the collaboration with the BL was achieved by ensuring provision was made so that groups of museum and exhibition curators could attend the exhibition in special groups and learn about how academic research can inform a large\-scale public exhibit. Over 200 curators participated in these small\-group sessions, which was part of implementing a strategy to build links between academic research and public exhibitions. This has engendered a cultural change wherein Stirling researchers have advised other Gothic exhibits and integrated public lectures into the exhibitions \( **S2**\). 

 Among the events that have taken place as a result of this new positioning of Gothic research and public exhibitions are the highly successful ‘Medical Horrors’ exhibit at The Old Operating Theatre, London \(Oct\-Nov 2015; coordinated and delivered by Edwards\) and ‘Writing Britain’s Ruins, 1700\-1850’ at Strawberry Hill House \(May\-June 2016; a public lecture series coordinated and partly delivered by Townshend and Lindfield\). In the former, Edwards advised The Old Operating Theatre curators on the history of dissections and terrifying medical procedures in Gothic literary and cultural history. He also presented a public lecture, ‘Gothic Dissections: Medical Dissections in Literature and Popular Culture’, to launch the exhibit on Halloween 2015 \(attended by 65\). In the latter, Townshend and Linfield advised Strawberry Hill House curators on the history of Gothic design for exhibitions on Gothic furniture and architecture. They also coordinated and participated in a series of six public lectures by leading scholars in the field about, among other things, Horace Walpole’s Gothic architecture, the ruins of Tintern Abbey and Gothic\-inspired interiors \(attended by 35 per lecture\) \( **S5**\). 

 In a retrospective looking at the success of ‘Terror and Wonder’ exhibition, Greg Buzwell, Curator of Contemporary Literary and Creative Archives at BL, highlighted its strong legacy in inspiring interest in the Gothic, including a range of books, learning courses, and the depositing of further Gothic material in the BL itself. ‘Terror and Wonder’ also firmly placed Gothic on the agenda of the BL, as it has ‘become something of a tradition to hold a Gothic\-themed event around the time of Halloween’ \( **S6**\).

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 UoB has improved confidence in linking crimes by using data on consistent crime scene behaviour by individual perpetrators.  This has resulted in police forces **globally** changing **policies and practices** and **significantly investing in personnel, training, and software**. Innovative new practices, such as the use of UK Automatic Number Plate Recognition alongside crime linkage data, are also being tested \(e.g., in serious sexual crime investigation\).  Researchers have also highlighted the limitations of crime linkage, presenting expert evidence\-based findings to the Scottish Court of Appeal, safeguarding its use by **setting a legal principle** to prevent the inappropriate application of the approach. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Crime linkage is the process of linking 2 or more crimes together, based on the underlying principles that a perpetrator’s behaviour will be both consistent and distinctive \[R1\]. Woodhams has developed the science underpinning use of crime linkage, with a particular focus on serious sexual offences. She has used **established benchmarks to assess the reliability of the underlying principles** \[R1\] which has led to significant advances in crime linkage research. These include conducting the **most robust studies to date with the largest, most representative, sample of sexual offences** \[R2\], conducting the only studies of unsolved linked series \[R1–R3\], and making detailed studies of the practice of crime linkage \[R4, R5\]. 

 Her team’s research has shown that across a range of crime types \(e.g., rape, burglary, robbery\), **offenders are sufficiently consistent and distinctive in their behaviour for a series of crimes from the same perpetrator to be identified with a high degree of accuracy** \[e.g., R1–R3\]. These positive findings have resulted in validating the use of linkage as part of the toolkit police can use. However, it has also been shown that some offenders are characterised by inconsistent and/or indistinct behaviour \[R2, R3\]. In these particular cases, erroneous links between crimes could be made \(both human and by algorithm\), that could have significant investigative and legal ramifications \[R2\]. In particular, Woodhams has shown that **unapprehended offenders are less consistent and less distinctive in their crime scene behaviour than apprehended offenders** \[R2\]. This is crucial, curbing over\-confidence in the methods, because crime linkage is often applied in order to identify unapprehended offenders. 

 Woodhams founded, and leads, the **Crime Linkage International Network** \(C\-LINK\), a collaboration of academics and police force practitioners now spanning 11 countries. The network was initiated with contacts interested and experienced in evidence\-based forensic psychology and is expanding through mutual connections to form a key route for international knowledge exchange, dissemination, and impact. 

 C\-LINK has conducted the most robust investigation of the relative value of different statistical algorithms for modelling offender consistency and distinctiveness, analysing 3,364 sexual offences \[R3\]. Based on this, and informed by research on crime analyst decision\-making \[R4\], they have identified the algorithms with the potential as decision\-support tools to automate parts of the linking process \[R2\]. For the first time, Woodhams and Davies mapped the decision\-making processes in two jurisdictions \(Belgium and the UK\) \[R4\]. In doing so, they identified how analysts incorporate academic research into decision\-making. 

 The strength of crime linkage \(whether automated or not\) depends on the data. Many countries use the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System \(ViCLAS\) data management tool. However, how evidential data is coded into this system varies between North America and Europe, with implications for data reliability and crime linkage results. Davies and Woodhams assessed the reliability of coding of sexual offences in Belgium \[R5\] and Switzerland \(ongoing\) and, in Belgium, demonstrated that for some behaviours it did not reach acceptable standards of inter\-rater reliability. They were able to **make recommendations for unifying coding, to increase reliability**. 

 Finally, as an example of the breadth of evidence used in linking crimes, Woodhams proposed the novel use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition \(ANPR\) data in the detection of serial sexual offenders; ANPR data is not routinely used or retained for this purpose. Using the largest UK dataset of serial sex offenders, she has charted geographical and temporal patterns of offending and demonstrated how consistent preservation of ANPR data across the UK would enhance police ability to link crimes and detect perpetrators \[R6\]. 

 Overall, Woodhams and her team have driven the development of crime linkage as scientific practice based on sound principles, while also constraining its inappropriate use. The Key findings \[KFs\] of the research can be summarised as: 

 **KF1**: The utility of crime linkage to help identify suspects has been established \[R1, R3\]; 

 **KF2**: Linkage evidence alone is not sufficiently reliable to establish guilt \[R2\]; 

 **KF3**: Weak points in current crime analysis practice have been identified \[R4, R5\]; 

 **KF4**: Algorithms to automate parts of the linking process have been identified \[R3\]; 

 **KF5**: Data sources not routinely considered for use in crime linkage can be used beneficially \[R5, R6\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

 <ins>International impacts on the use of crime linkage by practitioners</ins> 

 Increased confidence in the reliability of linkage analysis, as **used by practitioners internationally as an investigative method** \[KF1, KF4\], has been provided from research by Woodhams, Davies and the Crime Linkage International NetworK \(C\-LINK\) \[R1–R3\]. This impact is evidenced by the sustained/increased use of crime linkage in countries across the world. For example: 

-  In the UK, the research has justified the continued use of crime linkage, where it is used in an average of 500 reports for the Serious Crime Analysis Section per year \[E1\]. Woodhams’ research \[KF1, KF3\] has also been used to resist financially driven changes to current processes which would have seen a simplification of the UK Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System \(ViCLAS\) but reduced its value as a crime linkage tool — a decision that has “directly impacted upon all 31,962 cases currently held on the SCAS database.” \[E1\] 

-  In Sweden, Woodhams’ research has been used to define **best practice** by establishing a new national unit as well as investment in the national ViCLAS crime linkage database for sexually violent crime. The Detective Superintendent leading the Investigative Analysis & Offender Profiling Group stated: 

 Research \[…\] by Professor Woodhams and the Crime Linkage International NetworK \(C\- LINK\) that she leads, was an important part of this decision taken by our senior management. \[...\] This new unit is a significant investment by the Swedish Police Authority. \[E2\] 

-  In Belgium, increased confidence has led to new ways of working in the national crime linkage specialist unit \(Zeden\-Analyse\-Moeurs: ZAM\) pertaining to coding practice, analysis and data control \[E3; KF3\].  In particular, **new legislation**, communicated by the Minister of Justice, Minister of Security and the Interior, and the College of Attorney means that all cases of sexual assault are now reported to the unit: 

 The results of your project, based on the efficiency and therefore the reliability of ZAM's work, have supported this legislative change, changes for which we have been fighting for years. \[E3\] 

-  In New Zealand, a new operational crime linkage tool, “which is fundamentally based on the research of Woodhams and colleagues” \[E4; KF4\], has been developed and “has influenced crime linkage analyses in cases involving serial burglary, car theft, sex offending, and robbery \[…\] this has resulted in successful prosecutions and the recovery of stolen property, thereby providing victims with greater access to justice.” \[E4\] 

 <ins>Informing best practice use of crime linkage through training and innovation</ins> 

 As a result of these changes in practice, evidence from University of Birmingham research is now used for **CPD training** of crime analysts. For example: 

-  In the UK, R4 is used as a CPD tool by the Serious Crime Analysis Section \[E1\]. 

-  In Belgium, the work conducted by C\-LINK \[e.g. KF3\] is used “in the training of police officers at all levels \[…\] as well as to the serious crime inspectors at the Centre for the Management of Sexual Violence.” \[E3\] 

-  In New Zealand, crime linkage training occurs “at a local, regional and national level that is underpinned by the research of Professor Woodhams and colleagues’ \[KF4\] reaching 5 out of 12 police districts \[E4\]. 

 Innovative aspects of Woodhams’ research are also being used in the UK police service, such as ANPR in crime linkage \[KF5\]. In February 2020, following a successful trial, **best practice guidance** to preserve ANPR data around stranger sex offences was sent to each of the 43 police force ANPR units. The Home Office Head of Innovation, Law Enforcement, states: 

 One of the areas explored, as part of a series of innovative activities, was a project to maximise the value of Automatic Number Plate Recognition \(ANPR\) data. \[…\] The police interrogation of ANPR data, as a result of the research by Woodhams, led to the identification of one or more new vehicles of interest in 35 of 50 unsolved stranger rape series in the UK. \[…\] This was a highly innovative piece of work, which has since been cited at high level meetings within the Home Office as an example of how academia, policing and Government can work together to keep citizens safe and the country secure. It has specifically informed the decision to invest further. \[E5\] 

 <ins>Informing the use of crime linkage in legal practice</ins> 

 In parallel with the increase in crime linkage practices, Woodhams’ research \[KF1 and KF2\] has also been used to highlight that crime linkage alone is not sufficiently reliable for evidential use in court and that its usage should be limited to investigative practices. 

 In 2014, the Scottish Appeal Court ruled on the admissibility of crime linkage evidence using Woodhams’ research \[KF1 and KF2\] as **the basis to set a legal principle** in an appeal case. The defendant’s appeal rested on analysis that suggested a murder was linked behaviourally to other murders in Scotland, which had occurred after the defendant’s incarceration. 

 Woodhams provided pivotal expert testimony to the effect that — whilst it represented a useful investigative tool \[KF1\] — linkage evidence alone was not sufficiently reliable to establish serial crime \[KF2\]. Her testimony proved definitive \[E6\] and according to the Procurator Fiscal for the Crown it avoided: 

 what would have been one of the largest miscarriages of justice in Scottish history \[…\] this case has become legal precedent for how reliability of evidence is assessed by the courts in Scotland. \[E7\] 

 The legal principle is now established and reported in *Renton and Brown’s Criminal Procedure* — the legal text of Scottish criminal law \[E8\] — and in the Forensic Science Regulator’s *Legal Obligations* publication \[E9\]. The latter document was quoted extensively by a senior legal commentator in her recommendation to the Scottish Law Commission that the test for reliability in this case could form the basis of a wider test on the admissibility of expert evidence \[E10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Bournemouth University \(BU\) has worked with the Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust and Odstock Medical Limited in electrical stimulation for many years, developing new devices and pioneering treatment methods. Since 2013, the devices have been used to help more than 10,000 people nationwide to improve their walking. Over 25,000 devices have been sold and sales of a new wireless system \(Pace XL\), developed by BU, have generated more than GBP1,000,000 in sales. A new orthopaedic stimulator is now commercially available. 

 The new devices and treatments have been used to help people with a range of conditions, including Bell’s Palsy, Parkinson’s Disease, orthopaedic problems, people with multiple sclerosis and those recovering from strokes. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Electrical stimulation \(ES\) is a method of externally controlling muscles following either neurological problems, where signals from the brain are interrupted due to neurological disease or accident \(stroke etc\), or in musculoskeletal problems due to muscle weakness or imbalance. When ES is used to provide a specific function, such as walking or hand grasp, it is known as functional electrical stimulation \(FES\). 

 The clinical service in Salisbury started after Professor Swain undertook the world’s first randomised controlled clinical trial of an FES orthosis in people who had a dropped foot as a result of a stroke. Results showed that it had significant advantages over traditional physiotherapy, as people receive therapy while they are walking, in addition to its orthotic effect, hence improving walking ability and quality of life \[R1\]. 

 BU took the lead in patenting the original Odstock Dropped Foot Stimulator \(ODFS\) in 2001, later known as the ODFS Pace, and in the early work of establishing the first NHS company in England, Odstock Medical Limited \(OML\), in 2006. Since then, Swain has led a collaboration between BU, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust \(SFT\) and OML, with the clinical service expanding to include the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis \(MS\), spinal cord injury and Parkinson’s disease as well as stroke.  This is an ideal working relationship, with BU providing the academic infrastructure, SFT providing clinical supervision, and OML providing commercial expertise and promoting FES techniques and equipment, running training courses and developing marketing materials. 

 The group \(BU, SFT, OML\) achieved a number of world and European firsts, working with other universities such as Surrey, Southampton, Salford and UCL; these included the first implanted dropped foot stimulator clinical service in the world in 2006 and, through the development of the National Clinical FES Centre in Salisbury, also in 2006, the largest clinical service in the world based on the results of clinical trials. 

 Clinical trials undertaken at SFT, supervised by Swain and Taylor, have shown that, in people who have had a stroke, FES is well accepted and 43% of participants improved their speed \[R2\]. In people with MS, there was also a highly significant improvement in walking speed and a training affect in those people who were less impaired \[R3\]. 

 Swain recently held a GBP117,576 National Institute for Health Research Programme Grant, which looked at the use of technology \(including FES\) in improving upper limb function post\-stroke. This enabled the development of an upper limb service \[R4\] as this research showed that FES was the assistive technology treatment with most evidence of clinical efficacy. Two further grants from spinal cord injury charity The Inspire Foundation, worth a total of GBP183,440, demonstrated that it is possible to use surface electrodes to restore useful hand function to people with tetraplegia \[R5\]. 

 Research on a wireless system by BU led directly to the development of OML’s wireless ODFS Pace XL system shown in Figure 1 \[R6\].

 Swain’s move to the Orthopaedic Research Institute \(ORI\) at BU to work with Wainwright and Middleton has enabled techniques developed for people with neurological problems to be applied to those with orthopaedic problems \[R7\]. Combining this expertise has led to the development of new stimulators and training courses.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

####  Health benefits 

 The findings from the BU, OML, SFT partnership have helped to develop the National Clinical FES Centre in Salisbury, the largest clinical service in the world. As of February 2020, 7,790 people have been treated in Salisbury \(excluding those on clinical trials\) and a wide range of clinical services has been provided. 

 In addition to those with walking problems, the following numbers of patients have been treated since 2014; 148 upper limb, 16 facial problems such as Bell’s Palsy and 8 for constipation. It has been established that our ES systems have radically changed people’s lives, increasing people’s functional ability and improving their quality of life, and hence participation in society \[E1, E2, E3\]: 

 ‘The ODFS Pace has given me my life back and I can’t imagine life without it. I am now able to do things around the house like cooking and cleaning. It also stops me relying on people all the time.’ 

 ‘One day I was in a wheelchair, the next day I was walking. FES has changed my life.’ 

 ‘I have been using a single channel stimulator for foot drop, due to MS, for five years. I wear it every day and it has allowed me to carry on working full\-time. It is the single most helpful thing in this journey as a patient, and has allowed me to remain as active as possible. I can’t praise the Odstock Medical staff enough\!’ 

 ‘Benefits are that it is strengthening his legs, his movement, more so when he is running, you can see that he’s lifting his leg more. He’s definitely participating more in school, getting involved with football.’ \[E4a, E4b\] 

 Over the past six years, other FES centres have been established in the UK, using our equipment, with the West Midlands Rehabilitation Centre having seen more than 1,400 patients, the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, more than 700, and Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital more than 500 \[E5\]. 

 BU research has shown that, in people with stroke, there is both a clinically significant orthotic effect in the walking speed, with 43% of participants improving their speed, and a training effect \(improvement when stimulation removed\) in the least disabled \[R2\]. In people with MS, due to the nature of the disease, there was no significant training effect, but people did have a 27% increase in walking speed, with 95% maintaining or improving their functional walking category \(FWC\) \[R3\]. Effort and fear of falling were reduced and people more able to achieve their goals. Actual falls were shown to be reduced by 72% and 73% in two trials \[E6\]. 

####  Policy impacts 

 FES obtained NICE approval in 2009 and, in 2016, a further NICE device specific publication, Medical Innovation Bulletin, MIB56, focused on the PACE system \[E7\]. Swain was also a professional expert on the development of new NICE guidelines \(IPG 677\) published in August 2020 on the use of electrical stimulation in non\-neurological long\-term conditions \[E8\]. 

 The Royal College of Physicians has positively commented on FES in its 2016 Stroke Guidelines: ‘People with stroke who have reduced ability to dorsiflex the foot \(“foot\-drop”\) should be offered functional electrical stimulation to improve their gait.’ 

 The Department of Health requested the establishment of training courses for professionals to spread the use of the techniques and FES technology worldwide.  Since 2014, OML has trained more than 600 staff in the UK and abroad in how to implement the devices and treatments developed with BU for people with lower limb restrictions and more than 400 staff in upper limb courses \[E5\]. 

####  Economic benefits 

 In order to compare the efficacy of FES to other medical treatments, QALY \(quality adjusted life years\) analysis was undertaken, initially by the NHS Purchasing and Supplies Agency. This showed that the cost of FES per QALY was calculated at GBP9,658, compared to a hip replacement, GBP5,623 and hip resurfacing GBP12,370. A figure of GBP20,000 per QALY \(keeping a person in a good state of health for one year\) is the usual criteria for NHS funding. 

 Using data obtained since 2014, this has been recalculated at GBP4,086 per QALY when the reduction in falls in MS patients is taken into account. In a recent independent paper from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, which exclusively used equipment developed by our group, a cost per QALY of GBP6,137 was calculated \[E10\]. The mean length of usage of the system is 6.2 years, although many people use it far longer, with more than 25% of people using it for more than 11 years. 

 OML’s remit is to develop and sell FES/ES products, train staff and provide patient treatment, both to the NHS and privately, utilising technology developed at BU. In total, more than 25,000 stimulators have been sold in 13 overseas countries \[E5\], including developing countries such as India, with the US, Denmark and Germany being the biggest markets. The number of full\-time staff employed by OML has increased since 2013 \(see table below\) \[E5\]: 

| **Period** | **Up to 2013** | **Up to 2020** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Staff employed | **16.4** | **25** |
| Patients treated | **4,996** | **7,790** |
| People trained | **2,565** | **3,620** |
| Countries where FES is distributed | **20** | **20** |

 FES sales have increased in value from GBP1,507,975 in 2012/13 to GBP2,122,360 in 2016/7 \[E5\]. Since 2016, OML has sold more than GBP3,000,000 of FES equipment, including 3,300 wireless systems worth more than GBP1,000,000 \[E5\]. A new orthopaedic stimulator, Orthopaedic Microstim, designed by ORI and marketed by OML, is also commercially available \[E5\]. It is suitable for the entire patient journey through joint replacement surgery: from pre\-conditioning, to reduction of oedema and pain immediately after surgery, to building up muscle strength once the patient has been discharged.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Urban Agriculture, the practice of cultivating and producing food in cities, is growing in importance in terms of sustainability. The practice offers substantial social, economic and environmental benefits for communities, such as job creation, improving mental health and greening neighbourhoods. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding sustainable models, models for upscaling and best practices to implement Urban Agriculture. Researchers at Salford have pioneered the implementation of upscaled Urban Agriculture, leading to creation of the largest urban farm in the UK and a wide range of other assets. Our research has also highlighted the value of the concept in decision\-making processes and supported policy change to enable wider\-scale application of the practice. In doing so, we have directly enabled GBP2,500,000 in funding for the practice so far and secured Government commitment for a further GBP8,000,000 to mainstream the concept in the UK. Salford’s research has been instrumental in creating jobs, shaping environments, influencing policy and effecting behaviour change, which has enabled the Urban Agriculture concept to flourish at scale. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Whilst Urban Agriculture has been active in the UK for many years, mainly through allotment gardening, larger\-scale examples of the practice are in their infancy. Salford’s multidisciplinary team of researchers \(Hardman and Armitage in UoA7, as well as Dr Michelle Howarth \(UoA3\), Prof. Alison Brettle \(UoA34\), Dr Graeme Sherriff \(UoA13\)\) has demonstrated that upscaled and mainstreamed Urban Agriculture can have significant impact on communities; acting both as a mechanism for improving the economy and the environment and as a tool for social cohesion. 

 **Upscaling urban farming practice** 

 From 2014 to 2020, Dr Hardman’s team was commissioned by charities, housing groups and Government departments to explore the potential for upscaled Urban Agriculture. In particular: 

 **Northern Roots** 

 From 2017 to 2020, Hardman was commissioned by Oldham Council to explore opportunities for bringing food production into the borough. Salford’s team conducted multidisciplinary research around the potential for upscaled urban farming, comprising interviews with key actors, economic modelling, soil science and ecological data and this ultimately influenced the formal plan for Northern Roots. Of particular note, research findings showed i\) the lack of sustainable models for Urban Agriculture and the need for a multifunctional space to promote resilience **\[3.1\]**; ii\) the immense potential of upscaled urban farming, particularly for job creation and health impacts in deprived areas such as Oldham **\[3.2\]**. 

 **Pendleton Urban Farm** 

 From 2016 to 2017, Hardman was commissioned by the Pendleton Cooperative to undertake research into large\-scale urban farming in Salford. Research focused on creating a typology of urban farming and engagement with existing schemes at an international level, revealing the large array of urban farming forms. Findings showed the perilous nature of urban farming in the area and the need to consider other forms of Urban Agriculture, such as community gardening **\[3.1\]**. Furthermore, the work highlighted the need to invest in a spectrum of activities, enabling the larger form of Urban Agriculture to benefit from informal, community and other forms of the practice **\[3.1\]**. The research also illustrated the benefits of guerrilla gardening and the social, environmental and health outputs of encouraging the practice **\[3.1\]**. 

 **Wythenshawe upscaled Urban Agriculture** 

 From 2014 to 2017, Hardman was commissioned by Wythenshawe Community Housing Group to undertake research into the impact of Urban Agriculture as part of their GBP1,000,000 Big Lottery Communities Living Sustainably project. The research showed the substantial economic, environmental and social benefits of Urban Agriculture in Wythenshawe, but also the fragile nature of the practice, largely due to a lack of funding, which created competition between actors **\[3.3\]**. Benefits ranged from the health impacts, such as increased consumption of healthy produce, to enhancement of the natural environment **\[3.3\]**. Salford’s research also highlighted the need for permanent growing spaces as opposed to purely temporary models and mixed the two forms to ensure maximum benefits for the communities **\[3.3\]**. 

 **Tools for enabling Urban Agriculture** 

 As well as influencing practice, the team has shaped national, regional and local policy around the concept of Urban Agriculture. In particular: 

 **National** **urban care farming** 

 The therapeutic use of farming practices is known as care farming. Social Farms and Gardens, the UK’s national charity for the practice, commissioned Howarth and Hardman to undertake research to inform a new code of practice for care farms in 2017. With urban care farming on the rise in the UK, the funders were keen to formalise the practice and its reputation, particularly amongst social prescribers. Through a series of workshops and interviews across the country, the team created a new quality assurance framework. This framework covered components required for a care farm to a recommendation for an inspection element, ensuring that spaces conformed with agreed practice guidelines to provide reassurance for prescribers **\[3.4\]**. 

 **Greater Manchester food policy** 

 Hardman, commissioned by Manchester Public Health and Food Sync, conducted research to assess gaps in Greater Manchester’s food provision alongside the potential for high\-tech Urban Agriculture at scale. Findings showed the need to invest in conventional Urban Agricultural spaces due to financial uncertainty around high\-tech food growing and success of schemes such as Incredible Edible **\[3.5\]**. Follow\-on research, exploring the Greater Manchester food scene and health benefits, influenced the strategic objectives of the board and food policy within Manchester and Oldham **\[3.6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Urban Agriculture can help to transform cities by acting as a catalyst for social interactions, economic activity and environmental change. Historically, Urban Agriculture has been small\-scale and often overlooked within policy and decision\-making circles. Salford’s research at a national, regional and local level has led to the mainstreaming of the concept. 

 **4.1. Upscaling farming practice to create environmental and social change** 

 Salford’s research has influenced the creation of more Urban Agriculture, by enabling Government investment of **GBP10,500,000** in local authority activities **\[5.1, 5.2, 5.3\]**. Our research **\[3.2, 3.4\]** has also directly led to the creation of large\-scale Urban Agriculture projects and programmes, such as the **\[text removed for publication\]** **160\-acre Northern Roots scheme**. At a national level, work with Social Farms & Gardens has driven growth in urban care farming, a form of Urban Agriculture **\[3.4, 5.2\]**, generating significant environmental and social change. 

 **Northern Roots** 

 Salford’s findings led to the permission for, and development of, the Northern Roots space: The Project Director at Northern Roots confirms that *‘Dr Hardman and colleagues have been instrumental in scoping and shaping Northern Roots from its inception in 2017 until the present day’* **\[5.1\]**. This has **fundamentally changed Oldham, enhancing eco\-tourism and tackling deprivation**, whilst also acting as a **sustainability hub at a regional, national and international level \[5.4 p. 39\]**. As a result of Salford’s research, urban farming was central to the development plan and included a multifunctional approach to the eco\-park **\[3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.4, 5.5\]**, with other activities adding financial support to the urban farm asset **\[3.2, 5.4, 5.5\]**. The **GBP8,000,000 award** is enabling Northern Roots to **increase cumulative biodiversity by 27% across Oldham; create 10ha of new trees; capture >18,000t carbon; produce 300kWp of green energy; prescribe 300 people per annum for nature\-based activities; reduce mental health issues and social isolation; and create 80 jobs, 40 new businesses, 45 social enterprises, 28 traineeships/apprenticeships and approximately 150 volunteering opportunities per annum \[5.1\].** 

 <ins>Oldham Council</ins> alone has **invested \[text removed for publication\] in Northern Roo**ts and as a result of Salford’s research the project was provided additional funding as part of the GBP1,800,000 award in Greater Manchester, with **\[text removed for publication\]** **jobs created by 2020** **\[5.1, 5.3\]**. In May 2020 planning permission for phase 1 of the anchor project was given to develop a **GBP6,000,000 eco\-centre** able to **process 600t of green waste** and act as a base for social enterprises and an education hub **\[5.4, 5.5\]**. Alongside job creation and environmental changes, **10 new volunteering schemes with approximately \[text removed for publication\] participants** have started, including a new bee farm initiative which trains residents in beekeeping through funded places **\[5.1, 5.5\]**. Salford’s research was central to the wider Oldham application to the UK Government GBP3.2 billion Towns Fund, with an allocation of **GBP41,000,000** **in capital funding to regenerate the borough** **\[5.1\]**. The wider implications of the research have seen Oldham review its green borough strategy, implement a new Food Strategy plan, and **fundamentally changed the focus of regeneration** **of one of England’s most deprived towns** **\[5.2, 5.4\]**. 

 **Pendleton Urban Farm** 

 Hardman’s research on urban farming **\[3.1\]** informed the model of growing spaces to be used in the **GBP650,000,000 Pendleton Masterplan** to transform one of the most deprived areas in the UK, **employing local residents** and **maximising social value** as a result **\[5.6\]**. Findings highlighted the need for more everyday forms of Urban Agriculture, such as allotments and community gardens, which were subsequently implemented within the Masterplan **\[5.6\]**. Associate Director, <ins>Planit\-IE</ins> and lead landscape architect on the Pendleton regeneration, confirmed that Salford’s work *‘enabled support for the Masterplan and incorporation of Urban Agriculture, particularly larger\-scale models \[and\] enabled an informal approach to urban growing in the area. This added evidence for the creation of a ‘guerrilla orchard’ in the centre of the community’* **\[5.6\]**. 

 **4.2. Improving the health & wellbeing of communities through Urban Agriculture** 

 **Wythenshawe upscaled Urban Agriculture** 

 Salford’s research **\[3.3\]** informed the types of activities requiring investment to maximise change and identified the models of Urban Agriculture to be used **\[5.7, 5.8\]**. This resulted in evidence of **behaviour change in the community of 75,000 Wythenshawe residents**, with the Programme Manager at <ins>Real Food Wythenshawe</ins> confirming that Salford’s research had guided *‘the types of Urban Agriculture for investment in the area, which in turn has led to healthier communities through improving eating habits and wellbeing’* **\[5.7\]** *.* A National Lottery evaluation demonstrated that, following this, more residents were eating their 5\-a\-day, health improved due to more growing activities, and there was an **increase from 40% to 86.7% of residents having a good level of wellbeing** due to interactions with the schemes **\[5.8\]**. **Further funding of \[text removed for publication\]** was received in response to Salford’s research to recreate the Garden City plan for Wythenshawe, **enhancing green infrastructure** and further upscaling Urban Agriculture, leading to the **creation of \[text removed for publication\]** **jobs** and **large\-scale volunteering schemes** across the area **\[5.7, 5.8\]**. 

 **4.3. Creating tools and policies to support Urban Agriculture** 

 **Growing urban care farming** 

 The team’s research has directly led to new national, regional and local policy support for Urban Agriculture. At the national level, Salford’s funded work with <ins>Social Farms & Gardens</ins> has created a **new national code of practice**, enabling the **\[text removed for publication\]** **Defra/UK Government Growing Care Farm project** **\[5.2\]**. This has led to the **expansion of urban care farming** and the **fulfilment of commitments in the Defra 25 Year Environment** **Plan**. The code of practice, generated through research exploring stakeholder views in the sector, **enhanced the reputation of care farming** and **led to increased investment** **\[3.4, 5.2\]**. Approximately **80 sites** **in the UK** have so far signed up to the code, including a significant number of urban farms, and the Executive Director, Social Farms & Gardens asserts that *‘feedback has shown that the code has resulted in **more financially secure spaces** whilst also **enabling social prescribing to rise in use, impacting on the mental health and wellbeing of populations**’* **\[5.2\]** *.* Further Government investment has since been made into care and urban farming from <ins>Natural England</ins> and other bodies **\[5.2\]**. 

 **Greater Manchester food policy** 

 At a regional level, Salford’s work has led to **significant food policy change in Oldham**: The Chief Executive Officer at <ins>Food Sync</ins> confirmed that *‘the University’s work on Northern Roots has resulted in the scheme being central to the new Oldham Food Strategy \[…\] Urban Agriculture features heavily in this new policy, linking to the national food policy and wider regional action in this environment’* **\[5.3, 5.9\]**. Salford’s research has also resulted in the creation of a **new senior food board** to be rolled out across all <ins>Manchester Health and Care Commissioning</ins> and <ins>Manchester City Council</ins> structures **\[5.10\]**. This has led to **significant investment in Urban Agricultural practice on a wider level**, with Manchester’s Public Health Commissioner adding more investment into the Growing Manchester scheme. This now supports **88 growing groups** and engages approximately **1,000 people in the city region** **\[5.3\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cognitive Behavioural Therapy \(CBT\) for people at high risk of developing first episode psychosis was established through research conducted at the University of Manchester \(UoM\). As a result, it is now possible to deliver an effective treatment to prevent psychosis, which is important since psychosis can cause significant personal, familial, societal and financial costs. This treatment approach was subsequently adopted in the UK in national treatment guidance for children and young people \(NICE, 2013\), as well as adults \(NICE, 2014\), and across the UK’s network of 153 Early Intervention for Psychosis services \(2016\). Consequently, approximately 1,200 cases of psychosis will have been prevented in England alone. It is also being utilised internationally, and delivered at specialist sites across Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 **Approximately one in 100 people worldwide have experienced a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. During 2004/5 in the UK, direct costs to the NHS were estimated at GBP**2,000,000,000, with indirect costs to society approaching GBP4,700,000,000. No evidence\-based treatments for prevention of psychosis were available prior to the trials conducted at UoM, and no other evidence\-based treatments have been developed since. 

 The aim of this research was to develop a psychological approach to the prevention of psychosis. Morrison and colleagues conducted a world\-first clinical trial, which demonstrated that **CBT alone seemed to prevent or delay the development of first episode psychosis, compared to regular monitoring \[1\] and this benefit was maintained at three\-year follow\-up \[2\].** 

 **Working with a sample of people at high risk of psychosis, this trial’s delivery of the CBT model developed at UoM \[3\] marked a new and significant step\-change in clinical understanding and treatment of emerging psychosis. This subsequently led to the development of the world’s largest clinical trial of a psychological intervention to prevent psychosis, based at UoM \[4\].** Two additional clinical trials conducted in Canada and the Netherlands replicated this research, using the same treatment protocol. 

 **Morrison and colleagues’ foundational work in the development of these trials, along with three others conducted internationally, informed the development of**  [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/) guidelines for treatment of **people at risk of developing psychosis, with their meta\-analysis suggesting that CBT could halve the risk of developing psychosis \[5\]. These guidelines have subsequently recommended CBT as the first\-line treatment to prevent or delay the onset of psychosis \(NICE, Guidelines CG155 and CG178, 2013, 2016\).** Without the clinical trials conducted by this UoM research group, and the adoption of their treatment manual by other international researchers and clinical services, these NICE recommendations would not have been made.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Pathways to impact 

 Following publication in high profile journals \[1, 2\], Morrison’s research on psychotherapy to prevent psychosis for people with ‘at risk mental states’ \(ARMS\) was presented internationally at leading conferences and disseminated nationally through presentation and teaching to established networks of academic and clinical specialists involved in treatment for psychosis. With the development of the first NICE guideline for the treatment of psychosis and schizophrenia in children and young people, Morrison’s trial evidence was instrumental in informing national and international guidance for the treatment of people at high risk of psychosis \(ARMS\). This guidance was subsequently implemented in the UK as a standard across relevant specialist NHS services. In the UK especially, training for the majority of staff delivering this NICE\-recommended treatment is also directly informed by teaching resources that are based on the Morrison model, including the treatment manual \[3\]. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

###  Impact on policy and clinical practice 

 Evidence from Morrison’s clinical trials, and others using their treatment protocol, led to the NICE guideline recommendation for CBT for ARMS. As a direct consequence of this recommendation, the Access and Waiting Time Standard \[A\] for Early Intervention in Psychosis services \(EIP\) was introduced, which includes a requirement that at least 50 per cent of people identified as being at high risk of psychosis are required to be offered, within two weeks of referral, NICE concordant CBT for ARMS to reduce their risk of psychosis. This level of dissemination has undoubtedly led to a major improvement in the clinical practice offered to this patient group: 

 *“The work that’s been done by Tony \(*Morrison\) *and colleagues around using CBT for prevention of psychosis is possibly some of the most important work that’s been done in the area of psychosis and schizophrenia since the introduction of antipsychotics in the 1950’s.”*  National Clinical Director for Mental Health \[B\]. 

 *“The research work from Morrison et al. at the University of Manchester, particularly the EDIE* \(Early detection and intervention evaluation\) *trials of CBT intervention \(1\) for young people at high risk of psychosis have been both influential and impactful, influencing thinking and practice in the UK in relation to early detection of and appropriate interventions with people identified as at high risk of making a transition to psychosis.”* National Clinical Advisor to the National Clinical Audit of Psychosis \[C\]. 

###  Impact on young people at risk of psychosis 

 The primary beneficiaries of this approach are young people with ARMS \(approximately 20,000 new cases each year in the UK\), along with their families. A conservative estimate of the direct impact of this work can be seen in recent NHS audit data \[D\], \[E\]. Across the UK during the year 2018/19 CBT was available to 1,243 at risk individuals, and a further 1,170 individuals with suspected psychosis. Extrapolating this data to the full implementation period suggests that up to 6,000 individuals with ARMS, and up to 6,000 with suspected psychosis, could have been helped directly in the UK alone. Given the evidence for the efficacy of this treatment \(i.e. reducing risk of transition to psychosis by 50%\), and the relative rate of transition among at risk cases \(20%\), approximately 1,200 cases of psychosis will have been prevented. 

###  Impact on education and training 

 Treatment manuals and associated training packages have been delivered nationally and internationally. The primary NICE\-concordant treatment for individuals identified as at risk of psychosis is CBT \[F\] and the majority of this formal teaching of CBT is the Morrison model: 

 *“The manual that they’ve written is the primary manual in terms of what to do psychologically with people with ARMS. One of the things we’ve been doing nationally is trying to ensure that people with ARMS get access to CBT, and it’s the work of Morrison and French that people look at in terms of what they should be doing.”* National Advisor for Severe Mental Illness for the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme \[G\]. 

###  International reach 

 This treatment model has also been utilised by clinicians internationally, with multiple trial replications, clinical services established, and local treatment manual translations across specialist sites in Europe, North America, and Asia: 

 *“The studies that Tony \(*Morrison\) *and his team have been leading, the first studies really showing that there must be room to consider the fact that for some people psychological interventions are enough, and may be preferred, have had a big influence on how people think about these type of problems, especially new generations of clinicians. It’s not just an approach that will have a short\-term impact but is very much a reform of how things are done, and the impact is international.”* President of the International Early Intervention in Mental Health Association \(IEPA\) \[H\]. 

 **Use of CBT to prevent psychosis in people at high risk is also recommended in the European Psychiatry Association’s guidelines \[I\] and the** Australian Clinical Guidelines for Early Psychosis **\(p.7, section 3.1.2\), which state that** “ *the individual and their relatives should be assessed and mental state and safety monitored regularly \(every 2 \- 4 weeks\) in a context of ongoing support. CBT is the preferred intervention*” **\[J\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at Essex has shaped the policy and practice of Essex and Suffolk County Councils, improving public service delivery. Essex research into novel ensemble tree methods formed the basis of new machine learning platforms and decision support tools to reduce human\-unconscious bias in decision making. Adopted by Suffolk County Council the tools support decision making processes and training of social care practitioners, enabling timely intervention and prevention measures for vulnerable children and adults, including children at risk of entering care. The tools developed from this Essex research have enabled the Councils to better understand and improve their use of data, develop staff expertise, and better target resources, improving public service efficiency in an environment of increasing financial pressure and demand on public services. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 During the last decade there has been a significant growth in the use of predictive statistical modelling in public sector organisations. The most significant challenges that local councils are facing are to identify particular groups which need more support from the government, or to classify people into different categories and provide more specific and appropriate support towards each group. Although there are many algorithms available for classification of such problems, most of them are either not fully data\-driven approaches or lack interpretability. For example the specification of the logistic model may not be well suited for the large data sets involved in such projects and model misspecification is likely to happen as more data are collected, while the results of neural networks may be difficult to interpret. 

 In 2015 Essex Risk Stratification \(ERS\) researchers \(based in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and led by Perperoglou, later Dai and Vrontos, supported by Lausen\) were part of the Essex team which received GBP2,200,000 of Catalyst funding from HEFCE for a collaborative project with Essex and Suffolk County Councils \(ECC and SCC respectively\) \[ **G1**\]. The project aimed to use Essex research outputs and expertise to create and test novel data analysis methods and machine learning tools that would enable a more preventative approach to delivering public services and to develop a better understanding of the factors affecting outcomes for vulnerable people. To establish a purely data\-driven approach, which can reduce human\-unconscious bias in decision making and which could be easily adopted by SCC and ECC, the ERS team developed new predictive statistical methods drawing on their research \[ **R1, R2**\]. \[ **R1**\] proposes an ensemble of probability estimation trees, where a proportion of trees are selected on their individual predictive performance. Such an ensemble of trees has better performance than random forest and node harvest methods because only the best trees with highest predictive performances are added into the ensemble \(fewer trees are needed without losing predictive accuracy\). Extending this approach, \[ **R2**\] evaluated the performance of the ensemble tree method via both unexplained variance and classification error \(\[ **R1**\] focused on classification error only\). Although \[ **R2**\] was published in 2020, the research in it started in late 2011. Since it uses similar ideas as that in \[ **R1**\], the research method was used in the SCC collaboration from 2018 where ensemble of classification trees were needed in SCC projects. These new approaches improve the predictive ability of random forests and increase the interpretability of the machine learning tool by reduction of the size of the tree ensemble. The research selects the best trees in terms of individual accuracy and diversity from a large ensemble grown by random forest. By doing so, the team demonstrated that better prediction is achieved with even a reduced size of the ensemble. Thus, the computational burden is reduced, and the methodology can be used in the big data problems involved in the Catalyst project. 

 **Suffolk County Council \(SCC\)** 

 Between 2016 and 2019 the algorithms based on \[ **R1**, **R2**\] were developed by the ERS team and embedded in SCC’s first data\-driven platform, where they reduced unconscious bias in decision\-making, allowing human decisions to focus on classification of borderline cases while the remainder are determined automatically by the algorithm. The algorithms employed had a classification accuracy of over 75% in all applications, meaning only a small proportion of cases need to be considered manually. Furthermore, the algorithms provide timely responses and interventions based on the assessment of risks for individuals, by flagging at risk cases earlier than was previously possible. The team further developed the algorithm into user\-friendly predictive dashboards that were piloted with social workers in 2019\-2020. 

 **Essex County Council \(ECC\)** 

 The ERS team worked with ECC on a pilot project in 2016 on the topic of 'school readiness’ examining which factors contribute to children being ready or not ready to start school. Algorithms based on \[ **R1**\] were developed by the ERS the team to make predictions and create a profile comprising low, medium and high risk groups to inform practitioners and enable the successful targeting of resources. The ERS team successfully incorporated their algorithms into ECC’s existing PX Risk software platform.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Suffolk and Essex County Councils serve a combined population of 2,500,000 people. Working in partnership with ECC and SCC, the ERS team drew on their research \[ **R1, R2**\] to develop bespoke predictive data analysis tools enabling the Councils to adopt a more preventative approach for delivering public services, better target resources and manage data in an environment of increasing financial pressure. The research informed strategic decisions of SCC and ECC in data use, shaping the Councils’ public service delivery and practice. ECC Leader comments ‘ *The collaborative partnership between Essex County Council, the University of Essex \[…\] has put us at the forefront of local authorities using the power of data science and artificial intelligence \(AI\) to tackle public policy challenges. We are investing in shared resources across our organisations to make Essex a place that is exemplar for integration of data across public bodies and to create the best data science and analytical capabilities in the UK to benefit our people and communities’* \[ **S1**\]. 

 **Changing SCC’s data strategy, improving commissioning and public service efficiency** 

 Prior to the Catalyst, SCC had not invested in tools applying machine learning processes to their data. Working with SCC the ERS team *‘used their existing research and developed new methods, to produce algorithms for four core SCC support areas’* Assistant Director, Knowledge & Intelligence of SCC \[ **S2**\]. The ERS team *‘applied their work on machine learning approaches: Ensemble of Optimal Trees for probability estimation tree \[ **R1**\] and Ensemble of Optimal Trees for classification tree \[ **R2**\], to the identified datasets. They demonstrated both their ensemble of optimal trees and grouped lasso algorithms had an accuracy of over 70%’.This evidenced the algorithms’ suitability to support SCC children’s services staff in their decision making processes’* \[ **S2**\]. 

 SCC confirm that this work has ‘ *taken SCC forward a huge leap in terms of tools to apply machine learning processes; it was the first time SCC had invested resources in such tools*.’ adding that ‘ *their work has also **led to more profound changes in SCC’s use of data and supported embedding new approaches**’* \[ **S2**\]. The team’s **‘** *cutting edge statistical analysis methods resulted in more accurate and consistent data entry, as well as improved data processing across several areas in SCC’* adding that the research *‘has given SCC new capability to understand key cohorts of service users, and their response to different interventions, from the higher quality datasets their work enables us to obtain. This was not something SCC had achieved before. It proved useful in the design and evaluation of interventions.’* \[ **S2**\]. The ERS team’s research enabled SCC to ‘ *understand better what we can achieve with the social care and education data we hold, allowed us to think strategically about our data including the implementation of consistent and accurate data collation processes*’ *. ‘We gained the confidence of SCC’s senior leadership team to develop this work further because **the research provided the evidence they required for the necessary changes to our public service delivery policy and practice**. Taking this forward **led to establishment of an ethical framework supporting descriptive and predictive analysis work across SCC**. \[ **S2**\]. The tools developed from Essex research enabled SCC to ‘ *prevent and manage increasing pressures on our public services by identifying community members at highest risk of becoming vulnerable in order to provide timely responses and targeted interventions’* which ultimately ‘ **enabled SCC to improve commissioning and public service efficiency’* \[ **S2**\]. 

 **Supporting decision making processes of SCC’s social care practitioners enabling timely intervention and prevention measures** 

 The ERS team produced four algorithms based on \[ **R1, R2**\] to aid the decision\-making of SCC’s social care practitioners in four areas: School readiness, NEET \(not in employment, education, training\), MASH \(Multi\-agency Safeguarding Hub\), CiC/CiN \(children in care/children in need\). SCC selected two algorithms for MASH and CiC/CiN, piloted in 2020 as training and decision support tools in practice. *‘ **The selected algorithms have been deployed to aid the decision\-making processes of SCC’s social care practitioners**, without overriding their professional judgement. **The developed models reduce unconscious bias in decision making, allow replicability of decisions, improve accuracy and enable timely intervention and prevention measures** by flagging at risk cases earlier than previously possible’* \[ **S2**\]. 

 **MASH,** is responsible for safeguarding vulnerable children and adults and triages notifications of need from agencies with safeguarding responsibilities. The ERS team’s algorithms support MASH’s current practices in assessing the level of risk for individuals to provide timely responses and interventions **,** decrease the number of false negatives and support MASH decision making, **helping more vulnerable people in need at a faster rate**: ‘ *The MASH team interrogate, extract and use data related to vulnerable children in a more efficient way as a result of the Risk Stratification team’s input’* \[ **S2**\]. The MASH model is now used in training and decision making for new and current SCC staff \[ **S2**\]. 

 **CiC/CiN** The number of children entering care in England has increased in recent years but funding to tackle this has reduced. The ERS team’s predictive model uses machine learning methods \[based on **R1, R2**\] to assign a risk level to individual cases supporting the decision making of case workers, helping them to prioritise workload. SCC confirms ‘ **the CiC/CiN model has helped identify those factors that can, in combination, indicate a greater or lesser risk of entry into care**; *it quantifies the risk effects of circumstances such as family dis\-function, neglect, age of the first entry into the system along with other contributing indicators of this outcome and provides a dynamic estimation for these risks based on new data collected by SCC.*  This model ‘ *has enabled us to look in far more depth at particular cases whose characteristics are suggested \[…\] as potentially leading to an outcome of CiC*’ which has ‘ *speeded up the decision making process’* \[ **S2**\]. This work aids the timely identification of children in need who are at high risk of going into care allowing preventative interventions to avoid the complexities and costs involved with entering care. According to SCC ‘ *the spend on services for Children in Care in SCC alone is more than £40m per year with over 300 children per year entering care.  It is a challenge to identify children that are on a potential trajectory to care. **Using the data to inform work that reduces 1% of children entering care would have a value of £400,000 per year. The human value of enabling a child to sustainably remain safely living with their birth family is priceless**’** \[ **S2**\]. 

 SCC concludes that the ERC team’s research has enabled them ‘ **to explore and understand our data in new ways, and make interventions with some of the most vulnerable in our society**, children and young people who may end up with an outcome of being in care; and contacts made in relation to safeguarding.’ ‘ **These initiatives could not have achieved the success they had without the tools developed from the predictive analytics research undertaken by the Risk Stratification Team**’* \[ **S2**\]. 

 **Integrating data analytics into ECC’s decision making processes informing service delivery** 

 The ERS team applied advanced machine learning techniques based on \[ **R1**\] to help ECC predict levels of school readiness in children to supplement existing expertise and facilitate targeted community interventions. The work supported the integration of machine learning techniques in the Council’s decision making processes ‘ **supporting the cultural evolution of ECC relating to the introduction and adoption of data analytics** *e.g. predictive analytics, data visualization and machine learning’* Head of Corporate Strategy, ECC \[ **S4**\]. ECC confirm that this work has ‘ *enabled us to optimise our data science approaches’* \[ **S3**\] and ‘ **helped ECC to embed techniques and models in their processes so that analytics can inform their service delivery**.*’ \[ **S4**\]. The ERS team’s work has ‘ *added value to the work being undertaken around the delivery of key Council strategies within the Essex Vision to support vulnerable people \[…\] and in the democratization, integration and management of their data, to derive intelligence that has **informed the design and implementation of service provision**. *The team has played a key role in drawing on its academic assets to work alongside ECC to unlock barriers and tackle challenges aligned to ECC priorities’* \[ **S2**\]. 

 **Embedding expertise in the Councils through staff training and professional development** 

 SCC data analysts underwent ‘ *an intensive training programme in the use and generation of the Risk Stratification academics’ algorithms* \[ **S2**\] *’*. Specifically, the ERS team worked closely with SCC’s data analysts providing training in decision support tools for MASH and CiC/CiN ‘ *embedding expertise in the techniques born out of their research’* \[ **S2**\]. This was the first time that the council staff were trained and had used such tools. SCC adds *‘It has allowed upskilling of our in\-house data analysts* *\[...\] SCC’s data analysts now apply the project’s machine learning approaches in their own work with increased confidence in visualising, linking and analysing data; this reduced report preparation time and improves the quality of reporting to senior management and decision makers.’* \[ **S2**\]. Working with staff at ECC, the team also provided *‘opportunities for upskilling ECC staff via training materials and one to one interaction’* \[ **S4**\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Over half of the UK’s pre\-schoolers are ‘fussy eaters’ and less than 20% eat the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables. We know that limited diets have significant adverse health consequences including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Research at Loughborough University has identified strategies to improve children’s eating, which underpin the UK’s first evidence\-based digital child feeding guidance \(the ‘Child Feeding Guide’\) for parents/caregivers and professionals and curriculum content for healthcare/childcare training. The guide has 1\) been adopted by NHS as the main advice for parents/caregivers across the UK; 2\) improved the ability and practice of >100,000 parents/caregivers and healthcare/childcare professionals to support children’s healthy eating, and 3\) improved the eating behaviours of children in the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Unhealthy or restricted diets during childhood contribute to numerous preventable health conditions for children and the adults they become. Fussy or restrictive eating \(e.g., just eating beige foods\) and not eating enough fruit/vegetables affect over 50% of children, yet many families and caregivers \(including healthcare and childcare professionals\) do not know how to manage this, often implementing behaviours which our research has shown can unintentionally worsen the situation.  Fussy eating behaviours in children can also cause anxiety and stress in caregivers, which further perpetuates the problem. 

 Parents/caregivers report needing evidence\-based guidance about which health\-promoting feeding behaviours to use with their children. Haycraft and Witcomb’s research has furthered knowledge and understanding of the role that parents/caregivers play in feeding their children. The research underpinning the impact was conducted at Loughborough University between 2001–2018.  All of this research has informed the development of the Loughborough University Child Feeding Guide digital guidance.  Six illustrative research examples are highlighted here. 

 Our research initially identified factors that impact food preferences and intake in adults and how these are influenced by the way in which they were fed as children by their parents/caregivers **\[R1\].**  Further work revealed the impact of parental feeding behaviours on children’s food preferences and intake, highlighting the formative role that parents/caregivers have in shaping children’s eating habits from birth **\[R2\-R6\].**  Notably, this research exposed a **disparity between the information available to those feeding children** \(e.g., parents, caregivers, childcare professionals, healthcare professionals\) **and what was known by academics/researchers about how best to facilitate the development of children’s healthy eating habits \[R3\]**. It is well established that poor dietary preferences in childhood are associated with adiposity and a range of adverse health outcomes in adulthood, meaning that **early intervention is vital**.  Our research highlighted an essential need to improve the way that information is communicated to parents, other caregivers, and professionals to improve child health **\[R3\].** 

 This underpinning Loughborough University research investigated how children’s eating habits are impacted by parent/caregiver use of adaptive \(healthy, responsive\) and maladaptive \(overly controlling, neglectful or indulgent\) feeding behaviours. This research has made novel, impactful discoveries including identifying, for the first time, a link between controlling feeding and young children’s emotional eating **\[R4\]** and the importance of parental role modelling for promoting children’s healthy food intake **\[R5\].** Importantly, both studies highlight how parent/caregiver behaviours can be easily modified to promote healthier eating habits in children. 

 Haycraft and Witcomb have also extensively explored which mealtime behaviours can reduce children’s fussy eating **\[R2, R3, R6\]**, to understand how to encourage diverse food consumption.  Moreover, research led by Haycraft piloting a family\-based intervention \(2012\-2016\) for the first time revealed a variety of child\-based and environmental factors which drive parents’ feeding behaviours.  This research resulted in the identification of key behaviours to target for intervention and support **\[R2\].** 

 Together, Haycraft and Witcomb’s research has advanced our understanding of how parents/caregivers feed children and which modifiable behaviours need targeting to support them to improve their feeding practices and thereby facilitate healthier child outcomes.  These research findings underpin the Child Feeding Guide \(CFG\).

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impacts claimed flow from our research findings which have identified strategies that improve child feeding behaviours to support children’s healthy development **\[R3, R4, R5, R6\].**  The **pathway mechanism** from research to impact is the Child Feeding Guide digital guidance \( [www.childfeedingguide.co.uk](http://www.childfeedingguide.co.uk/)\), produced at Loughborough University. **The CFG has led to the following impacts.** 

 **1. Child Feeding Guide adopted nationally within NHS resources** 

 Following a rigorous approvals process, the CFG was selected for adoption by the newly\-launched ‘NHS Health Application Library’ which provides trusted online health tools for different user groups. Notably, the CFG was the sole source of guidance on child feeding included in the new library. From there, the CFG was added to the NHS Start4Life resources which are the NHS’s primary source of digital guidance and support for families and professionals. Use and recommendation of the CFG by NHS healthcare professionals across the UK is evidenced by testimonials, personal communications, and requests for flyers to share with patients/clients, and the CFG is also a recommended support resource on NHS Trust webpages \(e.g., Dorset Healthcare *Maternal and Child Nutrition Guidelines*; Hampshire CAMHS *‘Eating Difficulties’ resources*; and resources shared by NHS City and Hackney, NHS Mid\-Cheshire, NHS Northern & Eastern Devon, NHS Ayrshire and Aran, plus others around the UK\). **\[S1\]** 

 The CFG’s reach to over 100,000 users **\[S2\]** was achieved via targeted promotion in key outlets \(e.g., the Institute for Health Visitors publication\), invited presentations / webinars / workshops \(e.g., to the Scottish Government’s Family Nurse Partnership conference; Primary Care and Public Health Conference\), through media engagement and dedicated social media accounts **\[S3\],** and accelerated via positive public feedback **\[S4, S5\]**, for example: 

 *“Anyone with a \#fussy eater should visit the @ChildFeedGuide website. Great, practical tips on positively approaching picky eating”* \(Clare Baseley, Registered Nutritionist\) 

 *“We love this @ChildFeedGuide website compiled by researchers at Loughborough University. It's full of practical tips and tools to help deal with fussy eaters.  A fantastic resource for parents and Early Years workers alike\!”* \(Mairi McLachlan, High5ForFruit\) 

 *“It has all the basic information that a parent might need”* \(Nutritionist\) 

 *“The @ChildFeedGuide provides “real strategies and tools to tackle fussy eating and create happy mealtimes””* \(Nottingham College\) 

 **2. Improved ability and practice of parents, caregivers, and professionals to support healthy eating behaviours in UK preschool children** 

 Our research identifying the feeding behaviours linked to optimal child outcomes has underpinned much\-needed provision of guidance and support for over 100,000 different stakeholders **\[S2\]**. 

1.  **Parents and caregivers** 

 Before the creation of the CFG, parents/caregivers reported an absence of information, guidance or support about how to feed children once children start eating solid foods. The CFG addresses this need and supports parents/caregivers, first, to change their understanding about how best to feed children, which parents attest to: 

 *“I didn't realise how much I used food as a reward so these \[tips\] have been great to change that.”; “Knowing what is normal is reassuring. There are lots of opinion\-based websites that are not based on fact which can be misleading when looking for information.”* **\[S4\]** 

 By providing parents/caregivers with opportunities for personal development, through educating, informing, and changing their awareness, this brings about improved feeding behaviours.  Parent JB commented: *“We have already started taking the pressure off my 4\-year\-old son and mealtimes feel less stressful for me\!”*.  And another parent explained that the CFG: 

 *“…made me think a lot about portion size and I stopped making her finish what’s on her plate…I didn’t think we had any real issues but now I think we did but I didn’t recognise it. It’s made me think differently about food.”*  **\[S4\]** 

1.  **Healthcare and childcare professionals** 

 Our research has also increased the ability of healthcare professionals \- including nurses, nutritionists, dietitians, and health visitors working across the UK **\[S1\]** \- to support families to feed children responsively. Nutritionist Charlotte Stirling\-Reed said: 

 “*The information contained within the Child Feeding Guide and provided by these subject experts underpins many of my current practices and the recommendations I share with families”.*  **\[S6\].** 

 The CFG meets professionals’ need for “ *evidence\-based, independent information … in front line practice*” \(Public Health Nurse\) **\[S5\]** which is also novel \( *“Innovative thinking*\! *”*\) and accessible \( *“This is an excellent resource tool and parents can access information via the internet \- this info is credible and accurate”*\) **\[S5\].** Healthcare professionals also report that the CFG addresses a previously un\-met need as there are no other credible, comprehensive, sponsor\-free resources available to support families with feeding children: 

 *“I work with parents and I now feel I have reliable information about fussy eaters to share”* – Health Professional; *“This is an excellent resource tool when so many parents are accessing info via the Internet”* \- Health Visitor, Belfast, Northern Ireland; *“I love it\!\!\! It's been so helpful, I can happily say it's independently produced :\)\) The clients have found it informative and it has helped them to feel that they were making changes and helping their children in a way that works for them. … It has really helped me to support my clients in feeling they are being listened to. Thank you”* \- Specialist Community Public Health Nurse. **\[S5\]** 

 Registered nutritionists Julia Wolman and Charlotte Stirling\-Reed commented that their ability to support healthy eating behaviours in UK infants, toddlers and preschool children had increased as a result of using the CFG: “ *This helpful website has enhanced my knowledge and understanding of how to effectively feed children”* \[JW\] and *“Having this evidence\-based, accessible support and information is so valuable to professionals like me for keeping my knowledgebase current”* \[CS\-R\] **\[S6\].** CFG training was endorsed for CPD by the Association for Nutrition, with the assessor commenting: 

 *“Many nutritionists’ work involves children, and how to persuade them to eat a healthy diet is important. However, this is an area not generally covered in detail in university nutrition courses, meaning that newly qualified nutritionists often have to learn about this vital area ‘on the job’. The in\-depth and practical nature of the course will mean that inexperienced nutritionists will be able to acquire a sound and evidence\-based grounding in best practice.”* **\[S7\].** 

 Awareness around how best to feed children has also increased in childcare professionals, who report that benefits from using the CFG include changing their understanding of fussy eating and \- consequently \- their mealtime interactions with children they care for: *“The way in which we approach children at eating times \[has changed\]”.* 

 Childcare staff now know how to change their behaviours to improve children’s eating: “... *raising staff awareness of the impact their behaviour towards food can have on children*” **\[S5\]** and pre\-post data from a representative sample of nursery staff **\[S8\]** demonstrated increased modelling of healthy eating habits, teaching children about nutrition more often, and re\-offering refused foods after engaging with the CFG training. These are all responsive feeding practices which our research **\[R5, R6\]** has shown promotes children’s healthy development. 

 Following positive feedback and outcomes from Children’s Centre staff \(commissioned by Rushcliffe Borough Council\) who used the CFG training, the Loughborough University team was approached as subject experts for support to tailor Nottinghamshire Public Health team’s activities as part of the UK Government\-funded obesity Trailblazer campaign.  Fussy eater training was identified as a key need by early years settings and the public health team recognised the expertise of the Loughborough University research team.  Although roll\-out was delayed due to COVID\-19, the CFG training has been licenced for use for children’s centre staff and early years professionals \(EYPs\) within childcare settings across Nottinghamshire, with Andy White, Public Health Officer, commenting: *“The research and development you and your team do is vitally important to raising knowledge and standards in the early years so we want to support this as much as we can”* **\[S9\].** 

 **3. Children’s eating behaviours have improved across the UK** 

 Our research has generated positive changes in UK children’s eating behaviours. We have shown that children’s eating habits can be a significant concern for parents **\[R2\]** who have requested help to improve this. The CFG has solved this issue for families. 

 Use of the CFG by parents/caregivers has been associated with significant reductions in children’s fussy eating behaviours.  For example, parent NNK said *“I have a fussy eater who is now 4 and very stubborn but improving with your advice”* and a mother of a 3\-year\-old reported that using the CFG had *“helped with \[her child’s\] fussy eating”,* while a Twitter user needing guidance on improving their child’s eating behaviours reported that the CFG was *“helping already\!”* **\[S3\]**. 

 Another CFG user shared: *“Hooray\! Littlest little one has finally decided that this soup stuff is actually edible. Yesterday she ate a little, today ‘I love soup’, \[it’s\] only taken 2 and half years of trying\!\!\! This great tool from @ChildFeedGuide can help you keep track of offerings”* \(SugarSwaps\) **\[S3\]**.  Further evidence from some of the Child Feeding Guide’s >100,000 users demonstrates that repeated offering of a food, as advocated in the CFG based on our research evidence **\[R2\]**, results in positive changes in children’s behaviours \- where they go from refusing foods to accepting and eating foods **\[S10\]**. Together, this highlights how use of the evidence\-informed CFG has improved UK children’s eating behaviours.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Rapid detection, accurate geo\-locating and prompt reporting of wildfire smoke plumes through automated camera systems on strategically placed towers has substantially reduced commercial forest wildfire losses and their associated global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Kosch’s pioneering research into artificial auroras has led to the development of advanced image processing techniques which have been exploited by the South African company EnviroVision Solutions \( [EVS](http://evsolutions.biz/)\) to continuously improve automated wildfire smoke detection. Commercialised as ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>, these systems are deployed worldwide, mainly in South Africa \(154 cameras\) and North America \(137 cameras\), but also elsewhere \(47 cameras\). By way of example, a study using MODIS satellite burn\-scar data demonstrates that for regions in South Africa where ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> is deployed there are significant declines in burn\-scar area compared to traditional manual lookouts, amounting to 120,000 ± 20,000 additional hectares of forest saved over the REF period, 35% of which EVS attributes to the underpinning research by Kosch. This decrease in burn\-scar area equates to a total commercial saving of approximately GBP1.0 billion and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction of approximately 27 million tonnes, which is valued at approximately GBP1.2 billion, in South Africa alone. In North America, we indirectly estimate the corresponding savings to be approximately GBP1.6 billion in timber and approximately GBP1.9 billion in CO<sub>2</sub>. The total impact of the underpinning research is thus estimated to be approximately GBP900.0 million in timber savings, and 23 million tonnes \(GBP1.0 billion\) in reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Artificial auroras are the optical signature of electron acceleration by plasma turbulence in the Earth’s ionosphere, which is artificially induced by high\-power, radio\-wave pumping. Kosch is a world\-leader in this research area, which was mainly focused on the UK\-funded EISCAT facility in Norway. Existing methods and algorithms \(pre\-2000\) for detecting and locating \(artificial\) auroras, but also other distant, ill\-defined, moving objects such as clouds and smoke plumes, were further developed, refined and improved, as described below, in research led by Kosch from 2000 to present. Taking advantage of advances in imaging technology, *e.g.* black and white to colour, low resolution to high resolution, visible to infrared *etc.*, automated smoke plume detection under any lighting and weather conditions is now commercially available. A brief description of a representative selection of the outputs that characterise the body of underpinning research and the relevance to ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> is given below. 

####  **Smoke plume detection \(\[3.1\], \[3.2\] and \[3.3\]\).** 

 This is at the core of ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> and generates the fire alerts. Image segmentation techniques in the algorithm are derived from those in Seviour *et al*. \[3.1\], where they were used to automatically identify clouds and natural auroras within monochrome all\-sky images of the night sky. A 90% success rate was achieved over 125,000 images without motion analysis or spectral information. In the daytime, improved smoke plume detection is now mainly done by motion analysis of turbulent smoke columns, *i.e.* tracking small\-scale, puffing features. This is implemented by difference imaging of a sequence of images taken a few tens of seconds apart, a technique derived from the temporal evolution analysis of artificial auroras \[3.2\]. In Kosch *et al*. \[3.2\], the optical temporal evolution was tracked by colour\-coded difference imaging to highlight regions of increasing/decreasing optical intensity. This showed that the time for artificial auroras to reach a steady state after the pump was switched on was long compared to the expected optical emission lifetime. At night, improved detection is further enhanced by the characteristic orange glow of fire reflected from the smoke plumes using methods derived from the spectral analysis techniques of artificial aurora research \[3.3\]. 

####  **False alarm suppression \[3.3\].** 

 Given the huge cost of fighting large\-scale fires \( *e.g*. aircraft\), false alarm suppression is a key feature of ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>. The single largest source of false alarms is the motion of cloud shadows on the ground. These are identified by spectral analysis, *i.e.* recognising that Rayleigh scattering makes cloud shadows appear bluer than smoke plumes enables their differentiation. The spectral analysis methods exploited are similar to those of Gustavsson *et al*. \[3.3\], who used calibrated multi\-wavelength observations of artificial auroras in order to estimate the energy spectrum of the accelerated electrons, showing it was highly non\-Maxwellian. 

####  **Range awareness \[3.4\].** 

 Range awareness is a critical feature of ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> that compensates for geometric scaling effects due to the distance from the camera to the imaged ground for any pixel within the field of view, resolving the ambiguity of small fires nearby which appear similar to large distant fires. Its roots are in the mapping of non\-optical data onto sky images of the artificial aurora for any altitude \(range\), *e.g.* radar beam patterns \[3.4\]. The research improved range awareness from previous crude near\-mid\-far categories to 10m resolution. Range awareness also allows accurate location of the source of a smoke plume from a single camera where standard triangulation is unavailable, such as on the fringes of a camera network. 

####  **Image registration \(\[3.4\] and \[3.5\]\).** 

 Image registration is fundamental to range awareness within ForestWatch®, and also compensates for camera tower sway in the windy conditions that are typical during wildfire storms. 

 In the daytime, digital map terrain lines within ForestWatch® are fitted to intermediate and distant horizons within real\-scene images. This ensures that image pixels map to the correct digital map location. The technique is derived from horizon fitting in all\-sky images of artificial auroras \[3.4\]. Important here \[3.4\] was the horizontal spatial displacement of the artificial optical emissions relative to the pump beam, which is a function of the beam angular direction relative to the magnetic field orientation. This was determined by mapping the pump beam onto the image for the altitude \(range\) of the wave\-plasma interaction. Spatial calibration of the image was done by locating the horizon in the all\-sky images. 

 At night, this is done in ForestWatch® by fitting to known stationary light sources, such as a distant town or telecom tower, which is adapted from star position fitting in images of artificial auroras \[3.5\]. Gustavsson *et al*. \[3.5\] made the first volumetric estimates of the artificial aurora optical emissions using bi\-static camera observations. Spatial calibration of the images for triangulation purposes relied on locating the stars within the field of view. 

####  **Tower location \[3.6\].** 

 Heyns *et al.* \[3.6\] used a multi\-resolution approach to a non\-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, *i.e*. a bespoke approach to a multi\-objective evolutionary algorithm, to optimise tower locations for a network of cameras within a real landscape topography. This maximises the observational coverage, which is usually set at 8, 16 or 24km, taking into account terrain features, land ownership, road access, power availability, forest canopy height and security. Coverage is improved by approximately 8.5% over manual site selection whilst also lowering the average tower height from 42m to 12m. Optimising camera tower locations for maximum coverage is important for reducing cost \(average tower cost is USD20,000\), and improving ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> detection and geo\-location of smoke plumes in hilly terrain.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Remotely detecting smoke plumes has many significant similarities to detecting clouds or auroras in images. They are distant, indistinct, poorly\-defined moving objects with irregular shapes; no two examples are identical although they share many common characteristics. This similarity between auroras and smoke plumes, and its potential for commercial exploitation, was recognised by the CEO of EVS, a fellow South African and long\-standing associate of Kosch, who founded the company in 2002, based on \(pre\-2000\) aurora research. However, the smoke plume detection algorithm within the ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> software undergoes continuous development, taking advantage of advances in imaging technology, *e.g.* black and white to colour, low resolution to high resolution, visible to infrared *etc.*, and drawing significantly on the methods and techniques derived directly from the underpinning research by Kosch at Lancaster University since 2000 \[5.1\]. Kosch is the EVS non\-executive Director for Research \(since 2011\), and has been an EVS board member since 2015. Consequently, the underpinning research by Kosch described in Section 2 has resulted in improved smoke detection capability of ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>, leading to the growth of EVS and economic and environmental impact, as described below. According to the CEO of EVS, “Prof. Kosch’s research is inextricably linked to the present success of EVS and the on\-going development of the ForestWatch® algorithm.” \[5.1\] Indeed, he estimates that 30% of the innovation within ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> existed pre\-2000, and that the research by Kosch accounts for half of the post\-2000 innovation \[5.1\]. Hence, 35% of the impact described below is directly linked to Lancaster research. 

 EVS currently employs 96 people and has an annual revenue of approximately ZAR30.0 million \(approximately GBP1.6 million\), which grew 20% and 18%, respectively, over the REF period \[5.1\]. \(Here and below we use an exchange rate of 18.9:1 averaged over the REF period.\) EVS also has a  [permanent office](http://evsusa.biz/) in Roseburg, Oregon, USA, with 6 staff who are responsible for the Canadian and USA markets. In Indonesia, EVS uses G4S as a contractor, and EVS is currently in negotiations with various contractors in China and elsewhere. To date, EVS has installed approximately 340 camera systems around the world, mainly in South Africa \(154\) and North America \(137\), including 20 and 79 new cameras in South Africa and North America, respectively, over the REF period. Trial installations are underway in various countries, including Australia, Chile, China, Indonesia, Greece and Spain \[5.1\]. 

####  4.1. 154 ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> systems deployed in South Africa have led to a large decline in fire damage 

 In order to quantify the scale of the impact of ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>, the results of a new, as yet unpublished, study are described. MODIS satellite burn scar data from 2001 \(satellite launch\) to 2018 are shown below for four distinct regional ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> fire detection centres in South Africa, the earliest of which was installed in 2005. During the fire season \(May to October\), when approximately 90% of wildfires occur, ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> detects up to 6,500 fires a month. In each case, monthly MODIS data is integrated over the fire season and limited to the combined ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> cameras’ field of view. Burn scar hectares \(Ha\) are shown pre\-ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> \(manual lookouts, red up\-triangles\) and post\-ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> \(blue down\-triangles\) with linear fits and their gradients shown. The data shows pre\-REF years so that the switch from manual lookout to ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> is clear. Transition years are taken to fall in both categories. However, the burn scar areas, and consequent impact, are calculated for the REF period only. 



 ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> in Richmond, KwaZulu\-Natal province, started in 2010 and involves 36 cameras covering 426,413 Ha. There is an evident reversal in burn scar trend after it was installed, with an average downward slope of 2800 ± 600 Ha/year, compared to the pre\-ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> increase of 1800 ± 500 Ha/year. In Highveld, Mpumalanga province, 22 cameras have been fitted, covering 337,961 Ha, since 2005. Again, there is a noticeable reversal in burn scar after ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> was installed, with an average decline of 800 ± 500 Ha/year, as opposed to the previous increase of 3000 ± 1000 Ha/year. What is particularly striking in the data for these regions is that the upward trend in the burn scar is actually reversed after the installation of ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>, meaning that its efficacy increases with time, consistent with the continuous improvement in the system mentioned above, to which the underpinning research has contributed. For the other two regions the data is less dramatic, but there is nevertheless evidence of a decrease in trend post\-ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> compared to pre\-ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>.  The system in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga province, comprises 27 cameras covering 335,955 Ha and was started in 2011. It shows an overall change in gradient of \-2,000 ± 1,000 Ha/year. ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga province, was started in 2015 and has 15 cameras covering 225,586 Ha. This is the only area of the four where there was a small downward tendency before the installation of ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>, but data are consistent with an improvement in the reduction of burn\-scar afterwards, with an average value of \-1000 ± 1000 Ha/year. The relatively large uncertainty in all cases reflects the erratic nature of wildfires. We note that the three regions in Mpumalanga were subject to a massive regional wildfire in 2007, and that Nelspruit was badly hit again in 2008. Whilst these fires were detected, extreme weather conditions \(hot and windy\) meant that they could not be contained. We also note that Richmond appears to have less variability and responds better to ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>, but this is a different province with a different contractor. 

 Clearly, the impact of ForestWatch<sup> *®*</sup> is not uniform across the different regions shown above. Thus, in order to evaluate the total impact we have combined all the data, taking the uncertainties into account. This analysis covers 81% of all ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> deployments in South Africa, with only pre\-MODIS and very recent deployments excluded, for which there can be no pre\- and post\-ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> comparison. In addition, MODIS burn scar analysis does not distinguish between different types of land use. On average, plantation trees account for approximately 40% of land usage within forested areas of South Africa, the rest being roads, settlements and steep terrain unsuitable for trees \[5.1\]. For the areas specifically covered by ForestWatch<sup>®</sup>, adjusted for the start date of the Piet Retief sites \(which was during the REF impact period\), we have used the difference between the linear trends pre\- and post\-ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> to calculate the impact over the REF period only. The total number of additional hectares of land saved from fire for the REF period is thus 310,000 ± 60,000 Ha, of which 120,000 ± 20,000 Ha is forest. The commercial value of forest is approximately ZAR200,000 to ZAR450,000 per Ha, dependent on tree type and maturity \[5.1\]. Hence, the value of timber saved by ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> amounts to between ZAR \(25 ± 5\) billion and ZAR \(56 ± 11\) billion, which is GBP1.3 billion to GBP3.0 billion. Burnt timber may retain up to 60% of its original value \[5.1\], hence the total savings realised in South Africa are estimated to be GBP800.0 million to GBP1.8 billion, with between GBP280.0 million and GBP630.0 million attributable to the underpinning research \[5.1\]. 

 In addition, each hectare of forest stores on average 209 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> \[5.3\]. Taking into account the reduction in lost timber calculated above, this translates into an estimated saving of 27 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>, 10 million tonnes of which is attributable to the underpinning research \[5.1\]. At an average discounted CO<sub>2</sub> cost of GBP45.70 per tonne over the REF period \[5.4\], this has a further financial impact of approximately GBP1.2 billion \(GBP420.0 million from underpinning research \[5.1\]\) for the ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> deployment in South Africa. 

####  4.2. 137 ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> systems deployed in North America increase wildfire detection 

 The economic burden due to wildfire, made up of direct and indirect losses and costs for prevention, preparedness, mitigation and suppression, is estimated to be USD70.0 billion to USD350.0 billion per annum in the USA alone \[5.5\]. EVS USA has deployed 137 ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> systems in North America, mainly in Canada, covering 1,072,265 Ha in Alberta and Saskatchewan, but also in the USA covering 683,030 Ha in California and Oregon. A report by the Oregon Department of Forestry shows that ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> fire detections from 2017 to 2019 exceeded all combined human fire detections over the 11 previous years \[5.2\]. Extrapolating the results from the MODIS satellite study in South Africa to North America, based on hectares covered, the approximate overall estimated saving realised is GBP1.0 billion to GBP2.3 billion in timber, plus an estimated saving of 38 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> with a further financial impact of approximately GBP1.9 billion. Given the 35% attribution \[5.1\], GBP350.0 million to GBP800.0 million in timber savings and 13 million tonnes \(GBP670.0 million\) in CO<sub>2</sub> savings are a result of the underpinning research.  Although ForestWatch<sup>®</sup> only covers a tiny part of North America, authorities are investing in the system, which is currently expanding \(79 new cameras since 2014\).

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 <ins>Research began</ins> <ins>at Cranfield University</ins> <ins>in</ins> <ins>2006 to address</ins> <ins>how manufacturing from large metal forgings could be replaced by a cheaper,</ins> <ins>faster,</ins> <ins>and more sustainable</ins> <ins>process</ins> <ins>in terms of use of materials. The focus was on titanium, a metal that is neither precious nor rare, and used extensively in aerospace and energy generation sectors as the strongest of lightweight metals. Titanium, however, requires 650 MJ of energy per kg to produce \- making it very expensive \(Ti \~$50/kg\) \- and significant amounts of the metal are wasted as part of traditional manufacturing methods. A typical airframe panel starts w</ins><ins>ith ten\+</ins> <ins>times material than finally goes on the aircraft \(the buy\-to\-fly \(BTF\) ratio\).</ins> 

 In principle, 3D printing could potentially save huge amounts of material, costs, and energy. But existing 3D metal printing processes, or Additive Manufacture \(AM\), were mainly based on powders with low build rates \(10\-100g/hour\), low build volumes \(<300mm maximum dimension\), with insufficient material properties and integrity, and still expensive. 

 
 **Figure 1. WAAM system being used to manufacture titanium space component which is now qualified for use.** 

<ins>A fundamental study pioneered the use of</ins> <ins>Wire \+ Arc</ins> <ins>Additive Manufacturing \(WAAM\) as a cheaper and faster alternative to the traditional ‘subtractive’ method of manufacture in aerospace applications. The</ins> <ins>basic concept of WAAM uses</ins> <ins>an electric arc attached to the end of a robot to melt a wire and deposit molten metal in layers in a predetermined pattern. \(See Figure 1\) In practice it is very complex to apply to the production of</ins> <ins>large\-scale</ins> <ins>safety critical engineering components. Research challenges included managing high build rates with accurate geometrical control; obtaining equivalent or better properties with</ins> <ins>guaranteed structural integrity; and being sufficiently cost effective to ensure a robust business case.</ins> 

 Initial research concentrated on investigating different process options \[R1\]. Subsequently, the relationships between process parameters and factors such as deposition geometry, microstructure, and properties for a wide range of materials was established \[R2\]. This enabled full understanding of the process capabilities to support development of design tools and actual part manufacture \[R3\]. To achieve even higher levels of performance a new patented approach was invented, using in\-process cold work between every deposited layer \[R4\], delivering properties in excess of previous production materials. 

 For manufacture of large structures, two critical problems were solved: management of distortion using various techniques including innovative tooling solutions \[R1\], supported by process modelling for prediction of stresses \[R5\]; and the development of a local shielding solution, for reactive metals e.g. titanium, to enable production of large parts without the use of a large and expensive chamber \[R6\]. 

 Research was brought together and applied to manufacture full component demonstrators in a wide range of materials and on the multi\-metre scale \[R1\]. Tailored cost and life cycle analysis tools were used to demonstrate benefits at an industrial scale. Extensive industrial case studies and technology transfer projects were undertaken \- with EPSRC, Innovate UK and EU funding taking the technology to TRL 9. In order for industry to take advantage of the research, a spin\-out company WAAM3D was set up to deliver the full supply chain \- provision of technology, equipment, software, know\-how training and support.

###  WAAM3D Ltd 

 <ins>A spin\-out company</ins> <ins>WAAM3D Limited \(Reg no. 11435762\) was incorporated in June 2018 to exploit WAAM technologies \(with the three main academics involved, Professor Williams, Dr Ding and Dr Martina acting as company directors\).</ins> 

 <ins>In December 2019, an equity investment of</ins> <ins> **GBP</ins><ins>3</ins><ins>,000,000**</ins> <ins>in two tranches of</ins> <ins>GBP</ins><ins>1</ins><ins>,</ins><ins>5</ins><ins>00,000</ins> <ins>was</ins> <ins>made by Accuron Technologies Ltd, the owner of several manufacturing companies in Singapore and Europe \(</ins><ins>Singapore Aerospace Manufacturing, Sitec Manufacturing, JW Kane, Esmo Group, Mechantronic GmbH, Zasche Handling</ins><ins>\) \[S1</ins><ins>\]. Accuron is also establishing a joint venture company with WAAM3D in Singapore to set up a component manufacturing facility using WAAM3D equipment and services \[</ins><ins>S3</ins><ins>\].</ins> 


 **Figure 2 the full ecosystem for WAAM technology provided by WAAM3D** 


 WAAM3D provides a complete ecosystem for companies; turnkey systems with specialist hardware, bespoke software and full customer support including system training, part building and small batch manufacture. \(See Figure 2\) After receiving the initial investment the company has already made **significant sales of GBP3,000,000** and produced **a profit of GBP300,000 in six months** **of trading**. The company has >7000 sq. ft of commercial and workshop premises in Milton Keynes and created 15 new jobs \(headcount: 15; FTE: 15\). \[S8\] Strategic partnership agreements have been put in place with key supplier companies including Kuka Robots. \[S7\] The company has also already been **awarded approximately GBP500,000 grant research funding.** 

 An ongoing pipeline of technology has been formally established for exploitation of continuing major research activity into wire\-based 3D printing technology at Cranfield University. This has been done through the establishment of an integrated technology programme \(ITP\). \(See Figure 3 below\). Projects at low TRL level commence through joint project with WAAM3D followed by full commercialisation projects, entirely within WAAM3D. WAAM3D provides customer needs to inform the University and ensure a full impact route all the way from TRL1 to TRL9. The company has been provided with exclusive rights to a bundle of Intellectual Property to enable the industrial adoption of WAAM and has optional access to future IP. **Two patents were granted** in 2018\-19 \(GB2491472B 06\-06\-2018, GB2569673B 25\-11\-2019\) and a further new patent application has been filed.

###  End user technology adoption 

 Companies in various industry sectors have been assessing and qualifying WAAM technology for industrial engineering structural applications, including BAE Systems, Weir \[S5\], Airbus Commercial and Airbus Space. 

 “WAAM technology shows major business benefits compared to the existing manufacturing routes such as reduced inventory, short lead times from months to days and even production of spare parts in remote areas like mining sites.” \[S5\] Head of Additive Manufacturing, The Weir Group 

 Additionally, some companies have moved through to full exploitation through the manufacture of parts for use. 

 In the defense sector in 2012 Lockheed Martin UK \(LMUK\) installed a WAAM facility, with the assistance of the University. They have subsequently used this for a number of projects in space, military vehicles, and other domains. LMUK have qualified parts and materials for spaceflight and have used WAAM to build spacecraft fuel tanks, rocket motor combustion chambers, thick section armoured steel components \(for ballistic protection of armoured vehicles\), and other primary structures. These projects have demonstrated the capability for WAAM to build parts that would have been conventionally made using forgings and other processes, with equivalent quality and material performance. WAAM enables LMUK to greatly reduce the manufacturing costs of these parts and gives them the flexibility to readily change the component design with minimal cost. WAAM also greatly reduces by months, lead times for parts originally made from forgings. Several of LMUK’s customers have contracted the organisation to build parts and components for them using their WAAM cell. \[S4\] 

 In the energy sector, TechnipFMC \(TFMC\) has installed several systems at their site in Dunfermline. These have been used for manufacture of specific parts saving significant time and therefore costs. For example, an energy project in Mozambique \(Africa\) was in difficulty when a business\-critical test stage for components failed, putting the project delivery in jeopardy. Using WAAM, TFMC printed critical parts within four\-and\-a\-half days, compared with the two\-month lead time expected using traditional forging routes. Significant liquidated damages for the company were avoided. \[S2\] 

 A new manufacturing company, Guaranteed, has been set up by ArcelorMittal specifically to manufacture parts by WAAM technology for their own steel production plants that have long downtime due to failed parts and a strategic diversification into parts and component manufacture for e.g. train and rolling stock manufacturers. \[S3\] 

 All these systems utilise designs and processes supplied by the University and latterly utilise commercial grade equipment or software provided by WAAM3D. 

 Initial work on technology transfer with industry partners validated the following benefits from WAAM over the use of conventional manufacturing technology:

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cardiomyopathy is a disease of heart muscle that can be fatal in cats, causing congestive heart failure \(CHF\) and arterial thromboembolism \(ATE\). RVC clinical researchers have been responsible for changing the current approach to diagnosis of feline cardiomyopathy. New recommendations for focused echocardiography, which can be easily conducted by general practitioners, and the use of plasma biomarker tests have been included in consensus statement guidelines and textbook chapters. The RVC\-validated NT\-proBNP test has been successfully commercialised globally by IDEXX and is increasingly used by general veterinary practitioners. Together, these measures have facilitated earlier diagnosis and treatment of this condition affecting approximately 15% of cats. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 With the appointment of Professor Virginia Luis Fuentes in 2004, RVC increased the number of academic specialist cardiologists to 3, creating a critical mass in this discipline to enable significant focus on clinical research. Luis Fuentes brought expertise in feline cardiology and by engaging with charities \(Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and Cats Protection\), Industry and breed societies, has developed a sustainable research programme investigating the epidemiological risk factors \(including genetics\) for clinical progression of feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \(HCM\). 

 Prior to the appointment of Luis Fuentes, RVC cardiologists were studying diagnostic and prognostic indicators that do not require echocardiography and pioneered the use of biomarkers in identifying cats with HCM, whether asymptomatic or presenting with signs of respiratory distress \[1, 2\]. Both NT\-proBNP and high sensitivity cardiac troponin I \(cTnI\) were shown to be predictors of survival in cats with HCM, with cTnI predicting reduced survival independent of the presence of heart failure or left atrial size \[3\]. These findings were corroborated by researchers working in the US who were commissioned to conduct similar studies using the same biomarker assays. 

 Armed with these biomarker tools, Luis Fuentes began systematic prospective study of the epidemiology of cardiomyopathy in cats in rehoming shelters. Luis Fuentes’ group described the relationship between heart murmurs and HCM, which is the most common heart disease in cats \[4\]. This study showed that not all affected cats have a heart murmur, and not all cats with a murmur have HCM, highlighting the difficulties faced by general practitioners in identifying cats with cardiomyopathy. A subsequent landmark RVC cross\-sectional study of 780 cats in rehoming centres \(the CatScan study \[5\]\) provided definitive evidence of the high overall prevalence of HCM in cats in the UK \(15%\) and expanded knowledge of the complex association between murmurs and HCM; HCM is more common in cats with high\-grade murmurs, but some cats with HCM have no murmur. The CatScan study demonstrated the striking increase in prevalence of HCM with age, from 4% in cats under 1 year of age, to 29% in cats aged 9 years or older. Furthermore, this study showed that HCM is the predominant cardiomyopathy in asymptomatic cats. 

 In parallel, the RVC group explored factors associated with cardiac mortality in cats with HCM and found that while many cats remain asymptomatic for years, independent predictors of cardiac mortality were left atrial enlargement, poor left ventricular contractility and/or extreme left ventricular hypertrophy \[6\]. While left atrial enlargement had been previously reported as a prognostic marker in cats with HCM, Luis Fuentes’ 2013 study \(the largest to date\) identified 15 additional previously unreported prognostic markers in feline HCM and showed that left atrial enlargement was the most important of all. Luis Fuentes’ work has also identified the specific risk factors for the most important complications of HCM adverse events \(CHF and ATE\) \[4\]. These risk factors are identified with echocardiography, a technique that requires training and experience but one that is becoming more commonly employed in general practice with the increasing availability of practical echocardiography courses, such as those run by the RVC. 

 The RVC group have pioneered a diagnostic approach based on identifying cats at high risk of cardiac complications, rather than the traditional but hard\-to\-use morpho\-functional classification that has little value for management decision making. By promoting risk assessment in target populations using simple methods such as measurement of plasma biomarkers and simplified \(limited\) echocardiographic assessment of left atrial size perfectly possible to undertake with the equipment owned by many small animal practices, cats with ‘high\-risk’ HCM can be diagnosed earlier and can benefit from earlier institution of preventative treatment before clinical signs develop.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 RVC research suggests that, of the 10,900,000 cats in the UK \( [PDSA, 2019](https://www.pdsa.org.uk/media/7420/2019-paw-report_downloadable.pdf)\), >1,630,000 are affected by HCM, many of which may not have heart murmurs or signs of the disease \[4, 5\]. Diagnosis of feline heart disease has been difficult for general practitioners, with diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in asymptomatic cats being particularly problematic without access to advanced echocardiography skills. Traditionally there has been an emphasis on classifying the type of cardiomyopathy using the human nomenclature for cardiomyopathy subtypes, as described in the only textbook specifically on feline cardiology that has been published to date \(Côté et al, 2011\). This requires sophisticated echocardiographic techniques and interpretation skills, making diagnosis difficult for non\-specialists and even trained specialists find this difficult \[a\]. 

 As a result, rather than pursuing a diagnosis in cats with suspected cardiomyopathy, many veterinarians in general practice have historically adopted a ‘wait and see’ approach, so that ‘high\-risk’ cats remained undetected until potentially fatal complications developed. Such complications can occur unexpectedly following a veterinary intervention \(such as general anaesthesia for routine surgery\) or may be spontaneous such as with the sudden onset of arterial thromboembolism. RVC research has underpinned the development of accessible means of screening cats and enabling practitioners to identify those at high risk of developing life\-threatening complications of HCM where treatment is indicated. 

 RVC research was instrumental in working with Guildhay Ltd. and its sister company Biomedica Ltd. in validating a test for NT\-proBNP in cats, which was subsequently sold to IDEXX, who further developed this for commercial use \[b, c\]. IDEXX Laboratories offer 2 feline assays considered as significant refinements of the Guildhay VetSign™ CardioSCREEN Test assay on a commercial basis: the Feline Cardiopet™ proBNP \(exclusive to IDEXX Laboratories and used to measure NT\-proBNP concentration in plasma from cats, and the SNAP® Feline proBNP, a patient\-side test kit made available in 2014, which uses the same detection system as the Feline Cardiopet proBNP reference laboratory test \[c\]. 

 After IDEXX started to offer NT\-proBNP testing, widespread adoption was hampered by scepticism among specialists in veterinary cardiology who expressed doubt in the test utility and recommended suspected cases to be referred to them for echocardiography. Luis Fuentes’ publication in 2015 \[5\] \(first presented at a conference in 2014 \[d\]\), however, demonstrated how common this problem is in cats in the general population and how variable the presence of a murmur is associated with this condition, suggesting screening of cats in general practice has a real value. This work was supported in part by IDEXX funding a PhD studentship and research project to perform an epidemiological study of myocardial disease in asymptomatic cats located in rehoming centres.  As a result of Luis Fuentes’ work, since 2014, IDEXX have seen a steady increase in the numbers of feline NT\-proBNP tests run as education and awareness of this publication has increased, and IDEXX continue to use the RVC publications as the foundation for their educational and commercial activities \[c\]. \[Text redacted for publication\] 

 In addition, collaboration between RVC and IDEXX Laboratories has expanded how the NT\-proBNP test is used in cat \[c\]. In emergency feline cases presenting with dyspnoea, removal of pleural fluid by thoracocentesis is both a therapeutic and diagnostic procedure. These feline patients are unstable and clinical scientists at the RVC suggested that measurement of NT\-proBNP in the fluid removed by this therapeutic procedure might distinguish between cardiac and non\-cardiac causes of dyspnoea in cats without the need for a blood sample to be collected \[c\]. RVC researchers proved this to be the case, and this was published in 2013 \( [Humm et al, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.12152)\) using the laboratory test and in 2016 \( [Hezzell et al, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.13831)\) using the patient\-side test. This work has led to significant advances in emergency and critical care of the dyspnoeic cat removing the need for a second stressful procedure of blood sampling in these unstable feline patients. 

 Following the discovery of the high prevalence of HCM in the general population, and easily recognisable prognostic markers, the RVC Cardiology group has advocated that the emphasis in diagnosis should move away from the traditional morpho\-functional classification of cardiomyopathies in cats, and instead focus on screening for cats with advanced disease that are at high risk of cardiac complications. The RVC Cardiology group has proposed pro\-active screening of cats from populations where the prevalence of HCM is high, such as older cats. Initial screening can be done using plasma biomarkers such as NT\-proBNP and cTnI. Recommendations for proactive screening using biomarkers or focussed echocardiography of cats citing RVC underpinning research have been included in textbook chapters and review articles since 2013, promoting use of focussed left atrial echocardiography \[e\].  RVC research comprises >10% of the total references used in the ACVIM consensus statement guidelines for the classification, diagnosis, and management of cardiomyopathies in cats, published in 2020 \[f\]. These emphasise that it is not necessary to use the traditional morphofunctional classification to treat feline HCM appropriately and recommends simple focussed point of care echocardiographic assessment of left atrial size and use of biomarkers by vets in primary care practice as an initial screening test for advanced subclinical cardiomyopathy \[f\]. 

 Ultrasound machines are now available in the majority of small animal practices, so an alternative in\-house method of screening for ‘high\-risk’ cats with HCM is to use echocardiography to assess left atrial size, which is a key prognostic indicator \[6\]. RVC clinicians teach final year students rotating through the cardiology service how to assess left atrial size using echocardiography as standard practice. This approach is increasingly adopted in general veterinary practice.  A 2017 RVC final year research project surveyed veterinary practices to assess diagnostic approaches to heart disease in cats, and found the median confidence level of performing brief echocardiography was ‘comfortable’ \[g\]. 

 Data from the RVC VetCompass<sup>TM</sup> database, which holds information from >15,000,000 veterinary patients seen in 1800 first opinion practices in the UK also suggests increasing frequency of biomarker and echocardiography use in cats by vets in general practice. VetCompass data showed at least 6\-fold increase in owners of feline patients being charged for echocardiography when the years 2013 and 2019 were compared, and a 5\-fold increase in NT\-proBNP tests between 2013 and 2019 \[h\]. This suggests that general practitioners are changing their attitudes and practises with regard to diagnosing heart disease in cats and adopting this pro\-active approach. Increased screening has benefits for high\-risk cats by allowing antithrombotic therapy to be started pre\-emptively to reduce the risk of arterial thromboembolism, and benefits for owners, who can monitor the resting respiratory rate of their high\-risk cat at home as a means of identifying the early signs of congestive heart failure, without having to take the cat on a stressful visit to the veterinary clinic. There are also benefits to veterinary surgeons, who can make a more informed decision about risk/benefit ratios in cats due to undergo elective surgical procedures or receive high rates of intravenous fluid administration that could precipitate congestive heart failure, in order to provide the best care possible to their patients.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Molly Scott Cato’s research has contributed to the conceptualisation of the 'green economy' through her political roles and activism. During her term as MEP for South West England \(2014\-2019\) and economist in the Green Party, Cato has drawn on research conducted at the University of Roehampton to inform changes in UK and EU legislation, influencing significant advances in the sustainable finance agenda that have global implications, including the development of sustainability\-focused benchmarks and mandatory disclosure; the limitation of the use of chemicals in food production; restrictions on the use of antibiotics in the agricultural sector; the transformation of the EU Green Group’s trade policy; and, informing the Green Groups’ opposition to the Mercosur trade agreement. More broadly, her practice\-based research has contributed to, and shaped, public discourse on issues relating to the environmental crisis and has advocated for a change to the global economic system. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Professor Cato’s research examines the fundamental conflict between the global economy and earth’s ecological systems. During the last decade, the issue of climate change has moved from a peripheral concern of scientists and environmentalists to being a central issue in global policymaking. Climate change has been recognised as the defining crisis of our time, prompting renewed urgency to address existing forms of economic organisation and their role in driving the ecological crisis. Cato’s research has been central to the response to this crisis in European and Green Party policy. Her praxis\-oriented research – as explored in the case study submitted to REF2014 – has focused on the processes and behaviours that make intensive use of energy and the planet’s natural resources \( **R1, R2**\), and has since been further developed into an argument in favour of the transition to a post\-capitalist, localised ecological economy geared to production for need, instead of profit \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\). 

 Green Economics takes a philosophical position characterised by a deep respect for nature, which is aimed at reducing environmental risks and achieving sustainable development. In an article in the *Cambridge Journal of Economics* \( **R1**\), Cato articulated the four central issues to a green study of the economy, namely: the need to end economic growth; the importance of equality and the need to interrogate the distribution of resources; the requirement to consider appropriate scale in economic decision\-making; and the need to include multiple perspectives in the study of economics. These key issues underline the necessity of developing an ecological economic system that would enable sustainability, consequently becoming a viable solution to the global environmental crisis. Cato \( **R2**\) analysed how an economy could maximise well\-being while minimising the use of energy, resources, and pollution, and demonstrated that to achieve sustainability there is a need to reconceptualise the global economy as a system of largely self\-sufficient local economies focused on the concept of a ‘bioregion’. This is an area with a geographic, climatic, hydrological, and ecological character capable of supporting unique human and non\-human living communities, resulting in much more limited environmental impact. The development of such an approach would force economic provisioning to begin at the local level – a behaviour that Cato defines as ‘trade subsidiarity’ – which would replace the energy\-intensive supply chains of the global economy \( **R2**\). 

 Building on the findings of her research detailed in the REF2014 case study, Cato further developed the concept of ‘the bioregional economy’ \( **R3**\) through the application of the Marxist concept of accumulation to the environmental crisis. Cato demonstrated that it may not be possible to address the environmental crisis within a reformed capitalism. Instead, this goal may only be met within a post\-capitalist ecological economy geared to production for need, not for profit. The goal of a sustainable economy demands a new ethic of consumption that prioritises locality, accountability and conviviality in the place of expansion and profit; a shift in the focus of the economy away from profits and towards provisioning; and a radical reorientation of work from employment towards livelihood \( **R2**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact of Cato’s research is entwined with her work as a politician since 2014, and her role as an academic\-activist. Cato’s work has drawn extensively on research undertaken at the University of Roehampton and has influenced Green Party policy in the UK, the policy of the Greens\-EFA parliamentary group at a European level and the transition to a more sustainable trade and financial systems. During her time as an MEP at the European Parliament \(2014\-20\), Cato was the Parliament’s rapporteur on sustainable finance and a member of the Economic & Monetary Affairs \(ECON\) and Agriculture & Rural Development \(AGRI\) committees. At a national level, as the Economics/Finance Speaker for the Green Party, Cato steered the party’s position on issues relating to economics, finance and taxation. Her media profile, also informed by her research and fuelled by participation in political urgencies including Brexit and climate change, has shaped public opinion and debates on these subjects. 

1.  **Contribution to the development of national and international legislation on key environmental issues** 

 Cato’s research on sustainability, preservation of natural resources and localised ecological economy geared to production \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\) has influenced her political intervention in key international debates and the development of legislation around issues that affect the planet’s ecological balance. Cato’s research is closely connected to many recent national and international debates concerning the agricultural model – which depends on the excessive use of chemicals and pharmaceuticals – and the need for a transition to sustainable food production, including the protection and natural nutrition of crops. Cato initiated a call at the European Parliament in June 2016 for a new model of a more sustainable and non\-toxic agricultural system. As a result, Cato and MEPs from the AGRI committee voted unanimously to safeguard bees from destructive neonics. The European Commission followed suit and implemented a total ban on the harmful pesticides that have been shown to destroy bees and other pollinating insects. The ban came into force in May 2018 and means that three harmful pesticides – imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam – can now only be used in closed greenhouses \( **IMP1**\). Cato was part of the negotiating team that agreed significant restrictions on the use of antibiotics in the agricultural sector, due to their contribution to anti\-microbial resistance. Cato was the Green negotiator on a package to restrict the use of antibiotics for farm animals, following mounting evidence that this has led to anti\-microbial resistance that threatens to radically undermine modern human health practices. She contributed to the interinstitutional negotiating team seeking agreement on a package coming into force across the EU from January 2022 that bans the routine use of antibiotics on farms, both for prophylactic and metaphylactic use \( **IMP2**\). 

 Cato’s research has also been integral to the development of the Green Trade for All paper, adopted by the Green/European Free Alliance group in the European Parliament in June 2018 \( **IMP3**\). The overarching goal of a Green trade policy is to ensure that trade achieves the maximum human well\-being for the minimum use of energy and resources \( **R2**, **R3**\). This entails the redesign of the global trade system so that it does not undermine the regeneration of ecosystems, while ensuring the possibility of high\-quality employment and environmental protection at home and abroad. Section 2 of the document, entitled ‘Trade Subsidiarity’, builds on the concept coined by Cato in her book The Bioregional Economy: Land, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness \(R2\). This concept suggests that consumption decisions should begin at the local level, replacing the energy\-intensive supply chains of the global economy. Building on this concept, the Green/European Free Alliance group supported the policy of transition to a system of largely self\-sufficient local economies, as articulated by Cato in her definition of bioregions \( **R2**\). The paper notes \(2.6\) ‘Trade subsidiarity would change global biosphere trade patterns towards a fairer balance. Regions which so far have been net exporters would gain breathing\-space for the regeneration of their ecosystems, if less biosphere were used for export. Regions such as the EU which so far have been net biosphere importers would need to accommodate new requirements for biosphere use and become much more innovative in finding appropriate solutions for minimizing such needs to the utmost minimum’ \( **IMP3**\). 

 The inclusion of the concept of trade subsidiarity \( **R2**\) in the Green Trade Deal provides a theoretical underpinning for this area of the Green/European Free Alliance group’s policy, including supporting their lobbying against a Mercosur trade deal that does not meet minimum climate standards, such as that agreed ‘in principle’ in June 2019 \( **IMP4**\). This deal predicts an annual quota of 99,000 tons of Mercosur beef to be exported to the EU at a low tariff rate, which would directly benefit the economy of Brazil, the largest producer of beef in the world. The agreement faced opposition from the Green party \- an action led by Cato – due to the impact it would have on the Amazon rainforest. Cato, leading the UK delegation of Green MEPs, wrote a letter to the leading supermarkets in the UK advocating for greater auditing of supply chains and identifying any products that have come from the Amazon region in Brazil which have resulted from illegal destruction of the forest \( **IMP5**\). This letter contributed to the decision made by the largest food providers in the UK to tackle this issue. In December 2019, 87 major companies including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda wrote to Brazil’s president Bolsonaro urging his government to stop the deforestation of the Amazon. 

  

 This intervention by the Green MEPs, and led by Cato, contributed to UK governmental action to tackle deforestation. In 2019, an independent taskforce – the Global Resource Initiative – was appointed to develop a set of recommendations on how to address the problem. Following the publication of the recommendations \(March 2020\), the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs launched a consultation on new legislation to tackle deforestation. The consultation closed on 5 October 2020, the same day that 20 big UK food companies including Asda, Sainsburys and Tesco wrote an open letter to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, urging the government to draw up new legislation to force the sector to implement tighter control of their supply chains. In November 2020, the UK government announced its decision to ‘go further than ever before to clamp down on illegal deforestation and protect rainforests’ with the introduction of the Environment Bill \( [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government\-sets\-out\-world\-leading\-new\-measures\-to\-protect\-rainforests](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-world-leading-new-measures-to-protect-rainforests)\). This bill includes a new provision that requires greater due diligence from businesses, making it illegal for UK businesses to use key commodities if they have not been produced in line with legislation designed to protect forests and other natural ecosystems. 

1.  **Influencing changes to sustainable trade and financial systems** 

 Cato’s research on green economic sustainability \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\) has been integral to the development of initiatives aiming to embed greater sustainability in global trade and financial systems. Drawing on her research on common ownership and sustainability \( **R2, R3**\), Cato produced an initiative report in November 2017 in which she suggested that reform of the Common Agricultural Policy \(CAP\) is necessary to redistribute EU funds away from mega\-farmers and towards small farmers who are at risk of disappearing. In May 2018, the European Parliament voted in favour of this initiative report. Under the new CAP \(point 9\) ‘Member States may adopt a simplified scheme benefiting small farmers if an annual payment of up to EUR 1,250 is made, irrespective of farm size. Participants are subject to less stringent cross\-compliance requirements and do not have to meet greening requirements. The total cost of the small farmers’ scheme may not account for more than 10% of the national funding allocation, except when Member States decide to ensure that small farmers receive what they would have been paid without the scheme’ \( **IMP6**\). 

 Drawing on her research on the relationship between economic activity and climate impact, and on the nature of incentives to encourage lower\-intensity business models \( **R2**\), Cato has played a key role in the redevelopment of the EU Sustainability Benchmarks. These benchmarks operate as investment indexes, where the underlying assets are selected so that the resulting benchmark portfolio's GHG emissions are aligned with the long\-term global warming targets of the Paris Climate Agreement. In May 2018, the Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation, creating two types of low carbon benchmarks, and environmental, social and governance disclosure requirements for the benchmarks. The original proposal was for a ‘low carbon benchmark’ and a ‘positive carbon impact’ benchmark. These were loosely defined and the second implied that the production of CO<sub>2</sub> might have a positive impact. Cato influenced the redesign of the benchmarks so that the EU Climate Transition Benchmark exerted pressure for companies to progress towards alignment with the Paris Agreement while the second, the Paris\-aligned Benchmark, required clearer and more scientifically grounded evidence that demonstrated alignment to a 1.5 degrees climate warming target. The Low Carbon Benchmark Regulation came into force on 10 December 2019. From 31 December 2021, every benchmark statement \(not just sustainability benchmarks\) will need to explain how the financial product aligns with the target of carbon emission reductions of the Paris Agreement. The Commission is currently drawing up secondary legislation in preparation for the launch of the low\-carbon benchmarks \( **IMP7**\). 

 Based on her work on sustainable finance and her research into the nature of the impact of financial activity on climate change \( **R2**\), Cato has also lobbied for the European Central Bank’s Quantitative Easing programme to eschew fossil fuels purchases. She co\-ordinated a letter to the President of European Investment Bank \(EIB\) from MEPs from the Green/EFA group calling for an end to investment in fossil fuels. These efforts contributed to the announcement from the EIB, in November 2019, that they would stop financing fossil fuel energy projects from the end of 2021 \( **IMP8**\). 

1.  **Raising public awareness and influencing public discourses on environmental issues** 

 Cato has developed a powerful presence in print and social media, steering the public debate on issues relating to the environmental crisis \( **R1, R2**\) and the need for a revision of the global economic system \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\), particularly within the UK in the wider context of Brexit. Since 2014, Cato has written 47 pieces for high\-profile outlets such as the *Ecologist*, *The Independent*, *New Statesman*, *Metro UK* and *The Guardian*, with an estimated circulation reach of 85,943,312 readers. For *The Guardian* alone, Cato authored 28 opinion articles since 2014, which were shared 24,801 times and generated 24,593 comments on their online platform \( **IMP9**\). The thousands of comments across these articles are a testament to a raised public awareness of the ‘green economy’ and Cato’s influence on public discourse.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Sykes’s research underpinned the decision by the Catholic Diocese of Cairns, Australia, to establish a drop\-in centre in 2015 in this seaport city, which is a hub for large multi\- residential Papua New Guinean \(PNG\) households. Sykes described how households comprise a mutually dependent network spread across Australian and Papua New Guinean towns and villages, including cities in southeast Asia. Members move easily between several dwellings over the course of a year, but become vulnerable upon leaving their network. 

 A proposal by priest **\[Text removed for publication\]** to the Diocese used Sykes’s data to advise that a centrally\-located shopping mall near his church could be the location for a family centre to meet social needs, enhance wellbeing, and build the PNG community by linking together numerous household networks. The resultant Papua New Guinean Catholic Centre \(PNGCC\) is addressing these fundamental goals by providing members of PNG households with an essential point of contact for meeting and message\-carrying. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 Sykes carried out ESRC\-funded ethnographic research into Papua New Guinean households in Far North Queensland \(FNQ\) and North Queensland \(NQ\) \[1\]. The research was undertaken January–December 2012 and October–December 2014, in the wake of a moral panic about the flood of Papua New Guinean economic migrants into Queensland. The study allowed her and her two local PNG research assistants to better assess the distribution and the habits of residence and association of Papua New Guineans in Queensland state. The study clarified confusing 2011 census data, which recorded 25,000 PNG\-born residents in Australia, of which 15,000 resided in Queensland, with many of these in the FNQ and NQ regions of the State. The census did not yield more exact region\-level figures and warned against making inferences from the published data. Sykes and her RAs found that the census office cautioned wisely. Despite the census data for numbers of Papua New Guineans in Queensland, accurate figures are hard to determine by conventional census methods. Sykes’s ethnographic moral economy approach showed that the population of a large network of PNG people in FNQ and NQ might swell from 5000 to 8000, were all the transnational household members to be present in those two regions during one month, and not in residences they possess in PNG, southern Queensland, other Australian States, or Manila, Singapore and New Zealand. 

 Sykes’s research \[2\] discusses the failure of the conceptual apparatus of standard political economy approaches to accurately identify the number of Papua New Guineans living in Australia. The 2011 census data recorded PNG ancestry by birthplace of parent or grandparent, which might include in the census data many ‘white settlers’ who had chosen to move to Australia before PNG Independence in 1975, after residing more than one generation in PNG. Furthermore, Sykes’s critical assessment of the usual measures of the PNG population, such as data derived from the property register, as well as school and health registers, exposed the inadequacy of these indicators for capturing the reticulating mode of settlement that typifies PNG households, with multiple residences in Queensland and PNG. 

 Sykes and her RAs \(Nalisa Neuendorf and Vincent Backhaus\) collected an ethnographic record of the moral economy of the PNG presence from accounts of life in 60\+ households and histories of household composition and settlement over three generations. Extended case studies, ethnographic interviews in family kitchens, qualitative surveys, and social network maps revealed a reticular migration pattern over two generations. Ethnography allowed Sykes to show that PNG identity was determined by a moral economy of people’s habits of association, rather than by measures of ancestral descent and property ownership. Data on the use of money and household provisioning evidenced the supportive linkages across many residences, revealing the character of the multi\-residence PNG household and its habit of connecting members across great distances in the Asia Pacific region. Families mobilise multiple residences in Australia and PNG to act as one transnational household to provide care for aged parents over the course of a year and to support education for children from the village. In Queensland, PNG people disperse themselves as homeowners, choosing to settle at distance from other PNG people and not cluster together in one neighbourhood, yet they encounter each other in farmers’ markets, at church gatherings, at their children’s school and sporting events, and in the comfort of air\-conditioned shopping malls. Therefore, Sykes defined the PNG household broadly \(mixed race, loose and changing membership, multi\-residential\) and made visible the scale of the community created by their interactions and transactions over both great distances and protracted times. The discussion of this domestic moral economy is published in a book chapter \[2\] and a series of journal articles \[3, 4, 5\]. Project RA, Nalisa Neuendorf co\-authored an article in *GeoForum* \[6\]. 

  

 The findings of Sykes and her RAs suggested that access to the PNG population in Queensland would be more successful if government services, church officers, and businesses contacted any of the numerous women who are well connected within the multi\-residential transnational households, than if they tried to contact \(non\-existent\) neighbourhoods, settlements, or enclaves of Papua New Guineans. These women carried news of comings and goings of people in different households, and thereby moved individuals to seek each other out while they were in the same town. The permanence of the Papua New Guinean Catholic Centre \(PNGCC\), directed by a committee of PNG women, created a reliable point of contact for the community by facilitating and even intensifying this kind of message carrying. It has become a vehicle to support PNG people in building community and supporting their mutual well\-being.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 Sykes’s research into PNG household composition led to the founding of the PNGCC in Cairns, the largest city in the northern regions of Queensland. PNG families do not form an enclave or neighbourhood in Cairns. Instead their residences are widely spread throughout the small towns of the city’s hinterlands. They do not connect by internet in this region where broadband provision is weak, but it is common to meet with other families while shopping in the city. The PNGCC is located in Raintrees Shopping Centre with its affordable shops and medical and dental services. It is a short drive to the government offices of Cairns and very near to St Francis Xavier’s Church where news of the Centre’s activities is shared through the Catholic community and PNGCC directors use the church office facilities to support their work. 

 Sykes’s research into the wide dispersal of PNG residences was used first to draft a policy for PNG people written by **\[Text removed for publication\]**, whose ardent interest in the well\-being of the Papua New Guineans in Australia shaped his work as a Diocesan priest at St Francis Xavier’s Church. When he relocated from PNG to Australia, he sought support from his Bishop for the large mobile community of unknown numbers of PNGs, now on his doorstep in the north of Queensland. The Diocese of Cairns chose to support the proposal and open a PNG community centre. 

  

 **Pathways to Impact** 

 **Development of the proposal for a PNG Catholic Centre** 

 Sykes shared key research findings over three public presentations in 2014, all to larger groups of PNG men and women who were members of different churches in the area \(Catholic, Seventh\-Day Adventist, United\-Methodist, and Salvation Army\). These presentations addressed: a meeting of 30 PNG women who represented various social groups in the region \(including popular clubs and sports\); a meeting of 8 church leaders working with PNG families; and a meeting of 60 PNG women and men from the wider PNG community. In these meetings, Sykes discussed PNG transnational households and their multi\-residential composition across Australia and PNG, and sometimes into the South Pacific, southeast Asia, Europe and North America. She highlighted the ways that people moved between the households, and the urban lifestyle of Cairns and Australia more widely, which created the need for a strong PNG community beyond the immediate family unit. 

 Additional meetings were held in 2014 to discuss Sykes’s findings in more detail, with aged care providers and several local government civil servants who knew the challenges facing the most vulnerable PNG people, such as the PNG widows of white Australian men who lacked support from their husband’s family and friends, and had only weak or no connections with members of other PNG families. These PNG individuals might ‘fall through the cracks’ between PNG households, and be overlooked by organizations that typically support mostly elderly white Australian women. Sykes’s research created the opportunity to speak about the issues raised by her research more generally and recognise the need for preliminary reports pertaining to the problem of care for the aged. During late 2014, Sykes held three one\-to\-one meetings with **\[Text removed for publication\]** in order to discuss her research findings in more depth. He used these discussions to develop his proposal to the Diocese of Cairns for a PNG Centre. The **\[Text removed for publication\]**, states that ‘ *together \[Sykes and* **\[Text removed for publication\]** *\] recognized that the research evidence pointed to a need for a PNG Centre to draw people into a community’* \[A\] in order to support the wellbeing of all members. 

 **Impact** 

 **Opening of the PNG Catholic Centre** 

 The Centre was envisaged as a meeting point for all PNGs in the region. The Diocese’s support included: 

1.  Allocating a portion of **\[Text removed for publication\]** time to assist the PNGCC Director. 

1.  Dedicating office space and administrative support at St Francis Xavier’s Church to support the Centre; and funding the refurbishment of the physical space at Raintrees shopping mall. 

1.  Making a formal commitment to the saying of a ‘PNG’ mass once a month to strengthen the spiritual community. The mass is said in Tok Pisin \(one of PNG’s three official languages\) and is attended regularly by 150–200 people in St Francis Xavier’s Church. 

 **Continuing impact of the Centre for the PNG population** 

 The significance of the Centre is felt today in the role it plays as a physical space bringing PNG families into a community of mutual support. **\[Text removed for publication\]** describes the vision of the PNGCC ‘ *to help the PNG community more broadly, simply by providing a space to meet for all Papua New Guineans. The Centre supports families who might attend regular events, and other Papua New Guineans who might simply drop in for a friendly chat’* \[A\]. This significance can be evidenced in various ways: 

1.  Daily community events hosted by the Centre: Arts and Crafts Groups; PNG Music Groups, PNG Mother’s Group, as well as groups that offer spiritual community \(such as Friday rosary\). **\[Text removed for publication\]** notes that regular attendance is upwards of 40 people in some of these events, but they also welcome drop\-in guests. Although the Centre does not keep a formal membership, its Facebook website is followed by 690 members of the community, and is used to share details of events, community discussions, videos and photos \[B\]. 

1.  The reach of the PNGCC is extended by the work of Centacare, the Social Services agency of the Catholic Diocese of Cairns, whose communications between other service providers and the wider network of PNG families support community building at a wider level \[C\]. 

1.  For example, project RA Nalisa Neuendorf \[F\] used the PNGCC to organise a 2018 workshop for the Centacare programme, ‘Our Place’, because it is the only space dedicated to hosting regular PNG community meetings. Neuendorf returns regularly to help out at the Centre, and to support what is now a successful community\-building programme \[C\]. 

1.  The casual style of the PNGCC \[B\] helps to solidify the PNG families into a community of mutual support. The Centre welcomes anyone that drops by, offering them informal casual conversations and referrals. For example, widowed PNG women began to drop into the Centre for companionship in the different mid\-week groups, often on recommendation of funeral directors and health care professionals and workers who knew they needed friends. 

 The PNGCC nurtures general wellbeing in all these ways. In their work, the Centre’s leaders focus on key issues for sustaining, supporting and building community. 

 **Capacity building** 

 Sykes’s research enhanced the capacities of the community to research its own interests. Each of the two Research Assistants in Cairns completed doctorates and found employment in research and higher education. While working with Sykes, the Research Assistants learned techniques for mapping social networks, as well as interviewing skills. Later they were both re\-employed on an ARC grant to study ageing amongst PNG expats in Australia \[D\]. Vincent Backhaus turned to questions of second\-generation migrant socialisation and education, and completed his PhD at the University of Cambridge. He now heads the Centre for Indigenous Education at James Cook University \(JCU\), having first established a programme to facilitate retention of second generation Indigenous and Pacific Islander students in secondary education \[E\]. Nalisa Neuendorf received her PhD \(JCU, 2020\) with Sykes as an external supervisor, becoming the second PNG woman to complete a PhD in Anthropology \[F\]. Neuendorf worked in the community services sector throughout the project and facilitated community\-building workshops for Centacare in Cairns. She is now employed as a researcher at the PNG International Medical Research Institute in Goroka, conducting projects on community\-based responses to domestic violence as a health crisis.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Adapting ancient precedents, King’s has pioneered a new model of ‘conversational’ scriptural interpretation in which visual art is used as a dialogue partner with the Bible. The contemporary conversational engagement of art with Scripture builds mutual understanding and creative perspectives on present issues for non\-religious as well as religious audiences. The approach has crucial importance for our increasingly polarised and conflictual times. 

 This research has had a direct and wide\-reaching impact on \(i\) the funding priorities of a major philanthropic foundation in the USA \(Fieldstead & Co.\); \(ii\) two major galleries \(the National Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum \(V&A\)\) which have developed curatorial and public education initiatives based on the conversational paradigm developed at King’s; \(iii\) a growing ecumenical network of churches worldwide, which have used it to deepen community while fostering greater understanding of other traditions; and \(iv\) the resourcing of both Christian ministerial training \(in the UK and the US\) and RE teaching \(in the UK\), and in particular the successful piloting of online formational study at a London school. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Theology and the Arts is a leading research area at King’s: the UoA has concentrated expertise in theological hermeneutics \[1,4\], visual exegesis \[1,3,5\], the devotional uses of art \[1\], and art’s capacity to act as a theological medium \[2,5\]. King’s research has shown how a ‘conversational’ approach to the interaction of the Bible and visual art has direct continuities with the symposia of ancient Greece and Rome, and with ancient dialogical forms of Jewish and Christian commentary – especially the Talmud and Christian *catenae* \[4,5\]. We diagnosed the need for an accessible, contemporary equivalent of such ancient scriptural commentary forms, and sought to create a comprehensive online analogue to traditional illuminated Scriptures like the *biblia pauperum* and *Bible Moralisée*. 

 We developed a theoretical framework for this ambitious project that combines the ‘reception aesthetics’ \( *Rezeptionsästhetik*\) of the Konstanz School of literary studies with Christian theological accounts of the Holy Spirit \(‘pneumatology’\) to analyse how visual art and biblical texts can interact in the present \[1\]. Works of art – like the texts of Scripture with which they are frequently in dialogue – can have valuable new meanings unfolded from them in new historical contexts. Quash has shown that, viewed in this framework, neither the biblical text nor any individual artwork need be regarded as just an historical artefact, speaking only of the circumstances of its original production. His research explores how encounters with text and artworks can be envisioned as an enriching and transformative process which leads communities of interpreters beyond the specific meanings that have previously been read out of the Bible \[1,5\]. 

 This research produced the hermeneutical principles that now undergird *The Visual Commentary on Scripture* \(VCS; thevcs.org\) \[4\]. Its innovation is to focus on how biblical texts are capable of productive ‘speech’ in the present \(i.e. generative of new transformative meanings for contemporary audiences\), and how this can be catalysed through the curated deployment of visual art to provide fresh contexts for reading and discussing Scripture in conversational mode. 

 A supple awareness of how different perspectives can interact productively in the interpretation of the Bible is essential in offsetting narrowly doctrinaire and potentially violent readings of biblical texts. Visual art is typically a hospitable space for multiple viewpoints to be explored \[3,5\], and the ‘conversational’ mode of interaction fostered by groups of three artworks \(as is standard at thevcs.org\) promotes peaceable rather than conflictual interpretative practices. 

 As the VCS demonstrates, new juxtapositions of text and artwork disclose a shared context: the ‘one world’ we share, despite the many perspectives on it that necessarily coexist in human history and in the present \[1\]. 

 The VCS has attracted international media coverage, and KCL’s pioneering approach to engagement with art as a catalyst for the interpretation of the Bible has informed several recent BBC broadcasts, including BBC1’s *Songs of Praise* and Radio 4’s *Sunday Worship* \[J\].

###  4. Details of the impact 

#  Impact 1: Fieldstead & Co. 

 King’s underpinning research produced theological and hermeneutical principles \[4\] that convinced a philanthropic organisation in the USA to explore the potential of art in online spaces to create dialogue for the public good, and to fund the VCS website. The organisation is now committed to supporting this innovative approach more extensively. 

 In 2016, we shared ‘The Theological and Hermeneutical Principles of the VCS’ and supporting materials \(including draft examples of online exhibitions\) with Fieldstead & Co., an organisation in the USA that supports causes it perceives to be of major public and international benefit \(including affordable housing; community\-centred town planning; and Christian–Muslim dialogue in Indonesia\). This resulted in a GBP6 million investment to extend the scope and reach of The Visual Commentary on Scripture. The website was launched at Tate Modern in 2018 and is now in the process of creating 1,300 online exhibitions, featuring 3,900 high\-resolution artworks, covering the entire canon of Christian Scripture. To date 225 exhibitions have been produced and displayed online. VCS exhibitions have created new dialogues in which historical works of art become a catalyst for present\-day reflection, and established new audiences for such artworks. This, in turn, reveals new potential for meaning in the artworks themselves. 

 Fieldstead’s Senior Vice President confirmed that its major investment in the VCS “represents a significant recalibration of our funding priorities” \[A\]. Fieldstead has been influenced by Quash’s research to support further projects that use visual art to explore religious ideas for the public benefit, and in October 2019 opened a contemporary art gallery based in Los Angeles \(Bridge Projects \[J\]\) to foster “more advanced and more open interdisciplinary explorations of the relations between contemporary art, spirituality, and religious traditions”. 

#  Impact 2: The National Gallery and the V&A 

 King’s research has directly influenced curatorial practice at these two major art institutions. Both the National Gallery and the V&A have drawn upon the VCS methodology to generate dialogue about and between religious traditions, and to engage a wider public in conversation with religious ideas and biblical stories. 

 The National Gallery’s Director of Collections and Research, Dr Caroline Campbell, confirmed the longstanding impact of the UoA’s research, writing that “The original research being undertaken by scholars of theology and biblical studies at King’s College London has continued to play a fundamental role in informing new initiatives at the National Gallery, as it comes into dialogue with the art‐historical expertise of our curators and researchers” \[B\]. Dr Campbell testifies that “Professor Ben Quash’s theological research in combination with \[then National Gallery Curator\] Dr Jennifer Sliwka’s art\-historical research enabled us to produce a series of 10 films on John the Baptist in art \(presented by Quash and Sliwka\) in 2014 \[J\], now hosted permanently on the NG’s website. These have had over 82,000 viewers \(and over 1,500 likes\) as of December 2020” \[B\]. 

 The National Gallery has programmed several recent exhibitions that examine explicitly religious themes, such as Visions of Paradise \(2015\) and Sin \(2020\). Dr Sliwka, Curator of Visions of Paradise, confirmed that “much of the material explored in this exhibition developed out of the collaborative work I did alongside KCL scholars \(Professor Ben Quash, Dr Robin Griffith\-Jones and others\) … \[T\]his research enabled me to re\-situate \[Botticini’s Palmieri Altarpiece\] into its original context, and better understand the wishes of its commissioner” \[B\]. Sliwka, who joined King’s in 2017 to become Deputy Director of the VCS, affirmed that during her curatorial work for the National Gallery her collaborations with Quash and his colleagues “led me to think more deeply about the original intended functions of devotional works of art in the NG collection” \[B\]. 

 Similarly, the National Gallery’s Curator in Art and Religion, Dr Joost Joustra, testified that “my ideas, methods, and approaches have drawn deeply on the research culture and outputs of King’s Department of Theology and Religious Studies” \[B\]. Dr Joustra, who led the curation of Sin, states that “An active partnership and ongoing conversations with Professor Ben Quash and his colleagues \[...\] was fundamental to the conception of Sin, and explicitly informed the choice of works, the exhibition interpretation \(wall text and labels\) and the accompanying publication, Sin: The Art of Transgression.” He specifically implemented Quash’s conversational methodology in this exhibition, resulting in “a different sort of curation” \[B\]: “using often surprising, diachronic juxtapositions of works to encourage a ‘conversation’ – both between the works, and between the works and the diverse audiences of the exhibition, who were encouraged to find and share their own pathways through the exhibition and think about a central religious \(and inter religious\) question” \[B\]. Dr Campbell confirmed the significant impact of the conversational model pioneered by Quash and his team: “These novel, religiously informed approaches to art developed in our partnership with King’s, and the conversational approach to art which brings historic and contemporary works of art together to ask ethical and spiritual questions, has fed into our planning of various new exhibitions on religious themes \[…\] The curators worked very closely with King’s theologians in designing these ground‐breaking exhibitions, opening up fresh perspectives on the sacred art at the National Gallery for contemporary audiences” \[B\]. A *TLS* review of Sin further indicates the success of Quash’s conversational approach, affirming this exhibition’s “undogmatic … transgression of fixed meaning”: “suggestive juxtaposition takes the place of hard exegesis” \[B\]. 

 The National Gallery was inspired by the success of Dr Reddaway’s research \[2\] to commission her to write and present a series of seven films for its website entitled The Audacity of Christian Art in 2017 \[J\]. More recently, it has prepared to launch a new strand of its public engagement activity in Art and Religion. As a direct consequence of King’s research, the Gallery has invited a wider public into conversations about the Bible and its role in art. A new National Gallery inter\-faith forum has been developed on the basis of the conversational approach to art and religion modelled in the King’s–National Gallery partnership, to allow predominantly Christian bodies of art to function as a starting point for conversation between people with diverse religious and philosophical interests. Dr Campbell emphasises the distinctiveness of this initiative: “This cutting‐edge ‘triangulated’ relationship between a university department \(King’s\), a national art collection \(the National Gallery\) and faith leaders across the board \(from the contacts of both institutions\) is unique in the UK as a way of opening up dialogue and using art as a way of bringing people together in a cohesive and congenial spirit, and in a less contentious way than direct discussions of disputed texts and doctrines might do” \(E2\). These developments have been intensified by National Gallery curators’ close involvement in the VCS, which has shaped their curatorial practice. The VCS model moves beyond the consideration of how to tell ‘the story of art’, to ask questions *with the help of art* about what sort of a world we think we inhabit, and how to live in it well. 

 In 2020, the V&A completed a major refurbishment of its Raphael Court, on the 500th anniversary of Raphael’s death. The V&A invited Quash to collaborate on a half\-hour film to celebrate the occasion, which will be hosted on both the V&A and VCS websites. The production of this film was inspired by the VCS’s conversational approach, and by previous films produced in a conversational mode \(cf. *John the Baptist*, referred to above \[J\]\). The V&A film stages a dialogue between an art historian, an historian and a theologian on how the biblical themes of Raphael’s famous Cartoons might speak to diverse audiences. This marks a new approach to presenting the Cartoons to a wider public, not just as historical artefacts but as works with the capacity to inform present perspectives and shared societal reflection. Dr Ana Debenedetti, Curator of Paintings at the V&A, explains that the Cartoons project “included a new interpretive approach to provide the public with a deeper level of access to the Raphael Cartoons … I discerned a way in which the underpinning research done at King’s in order to establish the principles and methods of the Visual Commentary on Scripture could be of great value to the project in opening up the Raphael Cartoons to new interpretations” \[C\]. 

#  Impact 3: Churches 

 Religious leaders and congregations have successfully used the VCS to foster a conversational mode of scriptural interpretation; to build ecumenical understanding between Christian traditions; and to sustain community during the Covid\-19 pandemic. This proved especially beneficial \(emotionally, spiritually and intellectually\) during Holy Week 2020 and in Advent 2020. 

 The VCS facilitated the global reach of King’s research. Hundreds of churches worldwide have benefited from the distinctive textual and visual resources provided in VCS exhibitions. These beneficiaries range across most Christian denominations, whose members are introduced through the VCS to the art and interpretative perspectives of diverse Christian cultures \(Coptic Ethiopian, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, Reformed, Lutheran, Pentecostal\), as well as Jewish perspectives. Churches have used the VCS to teach how the Bible and visual art are historically intertwined, and to enact an ongoing dialogue between the Bible and visual art that has cultural and personal significance, and provides an aid to devotion. In 2019, *The Tablet* reported that the VCS “offers a new way to pray” \[J\]. 

 In Holy Week 2020, we launched a daily VCS exhibition which ran from Palm Sunday until Easter Monday. This caused VCS subscription numbers to treble, and increased regular church use, which has remained at the higher level \(35,000 page views per month\) ever since, with the help of daily tweets on social media, as well as wide\-reaching press coverage \(e.g. *The Christian Post,* *The Spectator* \[J\]\). 

 The VCS is being used as a focus of study groups and a resource for preachers. The church resourcing movement HeartEdge \[J\], initiated by the congregation of St Martin\-in\-the\-Fields in 2017, promotes the VCS as a tool for growing and enriching the lives of parish communities. The Revd Jonathan Evens confirmed that the UoA’s research on the relationship between Christianity and the Arts has been “a key resource and inspiration for HeartEdge’s ‘Culture’ strand” and has “played a vital part in how we conceive of, as well as how we implement, our vision” \[D\]. Dr Reddaway was instrumental in devising a HeartEdge course, Inspired to Follow: Art and the Biblical Story, which draws on the National Gallery’s collections, and users’ engagement with this course “indicates use of the materials by 800\+ churches, including as far afield as Kathmandu” \[D\]. 

 Further far\-reaching impact for the VCS has been achieved through a partnership with Advent Online \[J\]. The VCS Online Advent Calendar 2020 was used by 3,000 church congregations through the Advent Online website. Revd Arwen Folkes, Curator of Advent Online, testified that the VCS provides “shareable, high quality, traditional, and original content … To have the VCS as part of our collaborative project has been a real asset \[…\] Churches have been directly sharing these resources with their communities, and dioceses and bishops throughout the Church of England, the Anglican Churches in Australia and Northern America and churches of other denominations … \[The website\] has been a timely and valuable source of encouragement and enrichment to many hundreds of people trying to sustain church fellowship and worship under lockdown conditions” \[E\]. 

#  Impact 4: Schools and centres of ministerial formation 

 Several educational institutions including Highgate School in London \(at secondary level\) Sarum College, Salisbury \(which trains Christian ministers for ordination\) and the Center for Transformational Churches at Trinity International University, USA \(which provides ongoing Christian ministerial formation\) piloted the use of the VCS to guide students to curate their own dialogues with visual arts and Scripture. They testified that the VCS website has generated a hospitable space for creative reflection and conversations at a time when many are studying at a distance, which has had intellectual and emotional benefits for students and teachers. 

 Clement Boden, a Religion and Philosophy teacher at Highgate School, used the VCS to teach four GCSE groups during 2019/20. Pupils were guided to replicate the VCS format of one biblical text, three artworks and a set of short commentaries that explore the present\-day implications of both artworks and texts. Boden reported that the VCS “encouraged reflection, discussion, thought and debate” \[F 0.55\], and noted its inclusivity: “Jewish pupils within the group were particularly pleased by \[the resources\] being more inclusive than they expected” \[F 3:10\]. He reflected that pupils chose “a large number of images of hope and renewal” \[F, 3:30\]; “that this group of 16\-year\-olds had been looking for strength and hope during the depths of mid\-May 2020 is encouraging; I remember feeling that I had greater hope in this generation for their and our futures than before the activity” \[F 3:58\].  Boden concluded that “the VCS resources are about making great art accessible, as much as about making scripture inviting and fathomable, and I can’t wait to use them again” \[F 4:35\]. 

 In 2020, the VCS was presented to a UK\-wide network of teachers from the Research Schools Network at a conference at St Matthew’s School, Birmingham on ‘RE within the curriculum’. Educational consultant Mary Myatt, a guest speaker at the conference, advised teachers to use the VCS website “as a first port of call” when introducing Christianity to pupils \[G\]. Ben Wood, Chair of the National Association of Teachers of Religious Education \(NATRE\), has endorsed the VCS, saying “if, like you me, you use artworks in lessons”, the website is “just brilliant” \[G\]. Sarum College in Salisbury has used the VCS at all levels of its educational activity, from its “short course programme \[…\] geared toward informal theological education for the general public” to its “Ministerial Formation programme”. Its Director of Academic Development, Dr Jayme Reaves, confirms “\[t\]he VCS has been an invaluable resource for us in helping students of all types make connections between the biblical text and art, creativity, and imagination and students have found it to be refreshing, illuminating, and engaging as it opens up new avenues for reflection for them they did not have previously” \[H\]. 

 The educational impact of the VCS clearly has potential for a global reach, and this is already demonstrable in the USA. Professor Taylor B. Worley, Managing Director for the Center for Transformational Churches at Trinity International University, used the VCS for ministerial training in 2020. He wrote, “I was so encouraged by how generative these devotions became for our seminar overall. The students \[...\] all remarked on how helpful it was to engage Scripture with the curated works of art ... It was a great way to start each day by warming up the visual and theological imagination. The students really benefited from that exercise and it propelled our discussions forward by leaps and bounds. They also expressed confidence to use the VCS with their \[…\] churches” \[I\].

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 Research by Professor Bracewell at UCL developed a technique to manufacture nanofibre materials that could be used in chromatography \(the separation of mixtures in solution\) to produce biopharmaceuticals, such as antibodies. The increased efficiency of the nanofibres, compared to traditional purification technologies, led to the development of a spin\-out company, Puridify, which was acquired for \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\] in 2017. The economic impact of the research extends further than Puridify, as the company’s Fibro technology for purification is now on sale and has been used by clients including AstraZeneca, resulting in a 6\-fold increase in efficiency of biopharmaceutical manufacture and an acceleration of the drug\-discovery process. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Nanofibres have been used for a range of purposes, including textiles, medical materials, filtration devices, bioengineering materials and energy cells. In the medical sector, nanofibres have been used to produce artificial organ components, implant material, tissue replacement and wound dressing and are the subject of much recent attention. In 2007, Professor Daniel Bracewell at UCL, and Professor Bob Stevens at STFC Rutherton Appleton laboratories, began collaborating on fabricating novel nanofibre adsorbents for bioprocessing, such as the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, using electrospinning technology. Work began in 2008 via an EPSRC CDT project to which Oliver Hardick, a PhD student, was appointed. 

 The aim was to improve on the purification technology that currently dominates the market in manufacturing biopharmaceuticals. Currently, beaded resin technology is the standard material used in chromatography \(the separation of a mixture in a solvent using another substance\). With this approach, a therapeutic protein such as an antibody can be purified, and the right molecule is extracted by filtering it through an adsorptive material.  While this adsorption\-based separation technology is effective, it relies on diffusion to reach all the sites available. This limits the speed of separation and therefore the productivity. To intensify the separation and increase productivity in manufacturing a new material that would enable convective \(i.e. directed\) rather than diffusive transfer of mass was required. This nanofibre\-based technology would be considerably more efficient. 

 The underpinning research behind this purification technology had to begin at the most fundamental level – development of the fabrication techniques to synthesise the nanofibre based adsorbent. The initial objective was to create materials with high surface area to provide high binding capacity but avoid the diffusional mass transfer limitations \(the slowed rate of movement\) found in existing adsorbents. The fabrication methodology and fundamental properties of these novel cellulose nanofibre adsorbents is summarised in \( **R1**\). 

 The work at UCL then characterised the performance of this new adsorbent material for bioprocessing. This data became the basis for the first underpinning patent of the nanofibre technology, initially supported by UCLB and was subsequently published by peer review in \( **R2**\). This research demonstrated an adsorbent operating at flowrates of 100 times that of typical adsorbent materials, resulting in a potential10\-fold increase in productivity. The UCL team then demonstrated how the convective nature of mass transfer facilitated by this new material enables operation at high flowrates to radically shorten operational times thus providing productivity improvements of over an order of magnitude \( **R3**\) for protein bioprocessing relative to the existing adsorbent technology. This progress took the technology to the point where in 2013 a company \(Puridify\) could be spun\-out using this underpinning data and patent application. 

 Research then proceeded via collaboration between UCL and Puridify using several rounds of TSB, BBSRC, EPSRC and Innovate UK funding and a PhD studentship. In the first grant 2014/5 \(BB/M004848/1, £140,778 to UCL\) the PhD student and postdoctoral researcher at UCL focused on improved fabrication techniques for cellulose nanofibre adsorbent \( **R4**\). The next grant was directed at the design of the adsorbent housing to provide a packed bed configuration for bioprocess separation and scale\-up \(EP/M017222/1, £608,611 to UCL\) with two postdocs at UCL \(2015\-17\) looking at experimental and computational fluid dynamics aspects respectively. 

 In a final project in 2016\-17 \(EP/N013395/1, £363,240 to UCL\) Innovate UK funding allowed the researchers to expand the use of the nanofibre separation technology to new/next generation therapeutic products particularly focused upon viral vectors. These products offer huge potential to improve patient outcomes but present unique manufacturing challenges due to their relative complexity and labile nature compared to protein therapeutics. The research examined both the recovery of adenovirus sourced from collaborators at Oxford University \( **R5**\), and lentivirus sourced from UCL \( **R6**\). In both cases the research showed that the capacity, speed of operation, and recovery of active viral vector product exceeds anything published elsewhere. This research saw the technology advance through the technology readiness levels culminating in a product called “Fibro PrismA” and the sale of the spin\-out company to GE Healthcare who have gone on to launch the product to their customers

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In 2013, as Hardick completed his doctorate, the nanofibre adsorption technology developed at UCL was sufficiently developed to launch a spin\-out company \(Puridify\), led by Hardick. Puridify, building on research from the UCL team, offered a solution to a variety of manufacturing difficulties for biopharmaceuticals. The collaboration between UCL and Puridify has resulted in a jointly patented new chromatography medium, now commercially available as Fibro PrismA. The impacts of the research have been significant; both its commercial impact on Puridify, and its impact on clients, helping to advance the development of life saving treatments. 

 <ins> **Commercial</ins> <ins>Impact</ins> <ins>on</ins> <ins>Puridify**</ins> 

 The global market for chromatography resin, a key component of biopharmaceutical manufacture is projected to grow from USD2,100,000,000 \(12\-2020\) in 2019 to USD3,000,000,000 \(12\-2020\) by 2024; a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 7.2%. The market is largely driven by the increasing demand for therapeutic antibodies. The efficiency gains over resin, made possible by Puridify and its Fibro technology platform \(commercially available as Fibro PrismA\) have huge potential not only of time saved, but also of scalability. The Fibro technology offers faster work rates, and allows a manufacturer to switch more easily between different biopharmaceutical products, potentially making advanced treatments more accessible to low\- and middle\-income countries. 

 These efficiency gains make the company extremely attractive to funders and investors. In 2013, the year Puridify was founded, the company won the first Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable \(OBR\) life\-sciences business plan competition. SR One, the venture capital arm of GlaxoSmithKline, provided GBP100,000 and lab space at the Stevenage BioScience Catalyst as a result. This collaboration later led to Puridify winning the 2016 BioProcess International Award for “Best Collaboration” with GlaxoSmithKline to advance industrial evaluation of Puridify’s FibroSelect The company also acquired investment from SR One \( **S1**\), UCLB and Imperial Ventures \(GBP850,000 in 2014\) \( **S2**\). It received non\-diluting funding from Innovate UK \(then TSB\) for further collaboration with Bracewell at UCL, in recognition of the importance of its research\-led work. 

 This series of grants allowed the company to progress through the technology readiness levels starting with improvements in the material, progressing into device design and finally looking into future application of the technology in viral vector purification \(2014\-2018\). In 2015 Puridify had a Series A funding round successfully raising GBP2,200,000 from SR One, UCLB and Imperial Ventures \( **S3**\). By 2016, Puridify had 14 scientists at their site at Stevenage and 4 postdoctoral researchers working with Professor Bracewell at UCL via Innovate UK funding. The company has also won six Innovate UK Awards since 2013. Bracewell and Hardick were recognised as finalists in the BBSRC Innovator of the year competition in 2015 \( **S4**\). 

 In 2017, GE Healthcare \(the chromatography resin market leader\) bought Puridify, recognising its innovation and potential and to gain “ *access to exciting technology that could give considerable improvements for some customers in their purification step”* \( **S5**\). \[TEXT REMOVED FOR PUBLICATION\]. This patent, and the technology developed stem directly from research conducted with Bracewell. GE Healthcare maintained the Stevenage site and has grown its 17 staff \(at the time of purchase\) to 25, and expanded its facilities. In 2018 they opened a pilot scale manufacturing facility for their proprietary nanofibre adsorbent technology on the site \( **S6**\). GE Healthcare was itself purchased by Danaher in 2020 and renamed Cytiva. As Cytiva, the company then launched the nanofiber based adsorbents as a commercial product in spring 2020, while tripling office space and further expanding the workforce. Cytiva is initially focusing on the purification of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies \( **S7**\). 

 <ins> **Impact on Clients**</ins> 

 Since the commercial release of Fibro PrismA in 2020, customer testimonials of the product have drawn attention to large increases in productivity \( **S8**\). The biologics expression team at AstraZeneca, evaluating fibro against standard chromatography, saw a 6\-fold increase in throughput. The purification officer, called the resulting efficiency gains “ *substantial… saving two staff one day each per week, so we can focus on more challenging work. It makes a big difference to us*.” \( **S8**\). 

 The Principal Scientist at LifeArc, says, “ *The main benefits of Fibro PrismA are speed and efficacy. As an organization that focuses on translation and progressing work from early lab\-based findings, Fibro PrismA is helping us to accelerate the research that brings transformative medicines to patients. We have seen an immediate impact on project timelines, including some of our Covid\-19 related work*” \( **S8**\). 

 As these testimonies show, the impact is not simply felt in efficiency gains, but the corollary progress in the development of therapies that contribute to wider wellbeing. Fibro lowers the bars to entry for the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. This technology, and the research that made it possible, is driving further innovation. As Puridify CEO and Bracewell’s former PhD student, says “ *We see the continued growth of smaller players in the industry and Fibro is directly intended to be a more attractive option to these players. Following the launch of HiTrap Fibro PrimsA we have seen strong uptake from across the globe and a broad user base which provides a good base for the launch of Fibro products for GMP manufacturing due early in 2021*” \( **S9**\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 BCU’s Entrepreneurship Education research focuses on customisation to ‘context’. Contexts considered include discipline, space and culture, and setting. Our research has shaped institutional policies, practice and pedagogy. Its beneficiaries include: \(i\) social entrepreneurship educators who adopted a BCU framework across Europe, establishing new communities of practice; \(ii\) entrepreneurs \(particularly women\) and lending\-institutions in the UK, Ghana and Pakistan, who benefitted from enhanced financial literacy; \(iii\) 1260 new start\-up businesses in Africa, whose educators had adopted our approach; \(iv\) long\-term unemployed women tenants, whose national housing association had transformed their approach to employability support to include entrepreneurial self\-employment. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The Business School has longstanding expertise in Entrepreneurship Education \(EE\), with original research highlighting a range of opportunities for contextualised and experiential education **\(R1\).** In particular, our contributions have demonstrated the need to adapt EE to the contexts of ‘subject discipline’, ‘space and culture’ and ‘setting’. 

 Researchers deployed a mixed\-methods approach, involving comparative analysis of academic job adverts \(across disciplines\), educator surveys and entrepreneur interviews, to identify the perception of EE needs in different subject ‘disciplines’. EE must be tailored to industry\-specific, entrepreneurial needs, in order to generate value for beneficiaries **\(R1**, **R2\)**. Our results confirmed the locus of practice in EE, particularly: \(i\) the importance of entrepreneurial role models; \(ii\) the benefits of recent industry\-specific entrepreneurial experiences of educators; and, \(iii\) the benefits of live projects, e.g. working on assessments and scenarios set by real companies, reflecting genuine business problems. This research identified the advantages of adopting existing pedagogies from disciplines other than business, particularly art and design\-based teaching practices, to support experiential learning and assessment **\(R1\).** Through an exploration of the careers of a cohort of creative graduates, **R2** corroborated this. It highlighted a deficiency in explicit entrepreneurship education \(e.g. entrepreneurship modules\) but found that creative discipline pedagogies “led to implicit enterprise education and to the development of entrepreneurial traits” \(e.g. opportunity\-spotting and networking\), due to the experiential nature of creative pedagogies. 

 Further BCU research identified the importance of incorporating motivations and strategies of prospective social entrepreneurs in the co\-design of curricula **\(R3\)**. Carey and Hill led the EE pathway for the Erasmus\+ Business Education for Sustainability project \(see below\). This work demonstrated the need for contextualised EE in the ‘discipline’ of social enterprise. This was particularly so for EE that acknowledged the motivation/orientation of nascent social entrepreneurs and specifically the challenges faced by social enterprises, e.g. when working with volunteers, including issues related to HRM, governance and accounting. 

 Our research has also included analysis of business support intermediaries in the UK, Ghana and Pakistan. We identified the EE needs of entrepreneurs within specific ‘space and cultural’ contexts. For example, **R4** demonstrated the link between financial literacy and access to finance. Using a mixed\-methods approach, researchers found that financial literacy is an interconnecting resource that mitigates information asymmetry and collateral deficit when evaluating loan applications. This was applied to the specific experience of women entrepreneurs, focussing on microfinance in the UK, Ghana and Pakistan. BCU researchers found contradictory impacts for women entrepreneurs accessing microfinance in Ghana. While access to microfinance was empowering, it frequently destabilised family dynamics, with repercussions for loan default. Researchers recommended that the family as a whole should be mentored to take collective ownership and joint decisions in the business, before the credit facility is approved **\(R5\)**. 

 Further research, using a longitudinal and participatory approach, focussed on the context of teaching entrepreneurship outside of formal, institutionalised education ‘settings’. This work was carried out in the UK, in collaboration with ASHRAM Accord, a national housing association. The work centred on developing entrepreneurial capacity amongst long\-term, unemployed, female housing tenants. We found that while entrepreneurial intent was strong \(particularly for lifestyle and micro\-business orientation\), there were practical barriers in terms of self\-efficacy/confidence, issues of intersectionality in terms of the participants experiencing multiple forms of discrimination, and reliance on \(and fear associated with\) the benefits system. These represented blocks to participation. The research developed a roadmap for a “pre\-entrepreneurship education” phase for tenants to be EE ready **\(R6\)**. 

 Regarding the quality of this body of work, **R1** has been cited 83 times, including by notable international scholars within the EE field. Papers **R2, R4,** and **R5** are in journals which are internationally recognised by the Chartered Association of Business School’s Academic Journal Guide \(2018\). Dr Simon Brown \(Head of Enterprise Development at the National Centre for Entrepreneurship in Education, 2011\-2017\) described **R3** as “an indispensable addition to anybody’s library that is involved with enterprise or enterprise education” \(see back cover\). Finally, **R6** was ‘highly commended’ at the Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship Conference \(2019\), in both the Gender and Enterprise track, and the conference\-wide ‘Knowledge Transfer’ category.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 **a. Enhancing international entrepreneurship education** 

 BCU participated in the AHEAD project, 2017\-2021. Our research changed the pedagogical approach to teaching entrepreneurship and social enterprise in 10 higher education institutions \(HEIs\) in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Based on our research, we co\-created entrepreneurship education teaching materials, which are accessible for all educators, and included: \(i\) case studies of good practice \(available in English and Swahili\); and, \(ii\) an extensive body of teaching materials \(available in English and Swahili\). This work and materials were disseminated at a conference and at a transnational ‘training the educator’ workshop, hosted by BCU, to 40 senior staff from these institutions. A follow\-up survey **\(S01\)** asked participants to: “think about the time since that workshop … \[and\] indicate how your entrepreneurship education provision has developed as a consequence”. Responses were gathered 12 months after the dissemination event, and found that: 

-  96% of workshop participants had adopted Design Thinking or Human\-Centred Design approaches; 

-  75% had adapted provision to suit their local context; 

-  92% said that “opportunities to teach experientially had increased”. 

 In addition, following their lecturers’ participation in the Birmingham workshop, survey participants indicated that this had shaped EE which supported over 1260 new student/graduate business start\-ups **\(S01\)**. Our research helped shape the institutional policy of all of the participating institutions. For example, one respondent stated: 

 “The workshop has been very useful in the review of the curriculum at the institution. Entrepreneurship training is now part of every curriculum in the School of Business, where I am the Dean” **\(S01\).** 

 **b. Materials for social enterprise educators in 8 HEIs across 6 EU countries** 

 As part of the BEST project \(2014\-17\), the School developed a novel set of learning materials that provided a framework for teaching entrepreneurship within the context of social enterprise **\(S02, S03\)**. The project was developed in response to the problems following the economic crisis \(particularly austerity\), with social entrepreneurship and corporate social responsibility emerging as key policy priorities in the EU. It was recognised that  “business and economics education and training does not adequately reflect this trend” **\(S05\)**. The teaching materials developed sought to address this gap. These materials have been translated into six further languages, were available globally via the BEST project Moodle site, and adopted by HEIs in Bulgaria, Greece, Lithuania, Spain, Portugal, Turkey and the UK. Universities varied in size from 8000 to 20,000 students, and materials included: 

-  A series of case studies **\(S04\)** which are accessible and used by educators throughout the EU \(available online to anyone\); 

-  The creation of a six\-chapter social enterprise curriculum \(available in seven languages\) focussing on entrepreneurship education within the context of social enterprise, climate change and sustainability. 

 **c. Improving micro\-finance opportunities for entrepreneurs in Ghana and Pakistan** 

 Our work influenced microfinance institutions in a number of countries, leading to lending\-policy change. For example, in Ghana, one SME lending institution changed as follows: 

 “from your findings … we have now made a policy change …especially, mechanisms have been put in place to involve husband and wife in the KYC \[‘know your customer’ is a banking term\] process … It has enabled a better understanding … reducing the number of delinquent loans” **\(S06\)**. 

 This new policy focus on supporting and facilitating shared, household\-ownership of decision making, as a result of BCU research, reduced risks associated with lending to women, while increasing their access to micro\-finance. The research demonstrated the societal benefit of this in decreasing the possibility of family breakdown. 

 Acknowledging a similar need in Pakistan, BCU academics used research to co\-design a programme of ‘train the educator’ workshops to support SMEs. Educators, in this context, are now better equipped to instruct learners and SMEs in how to gain access to finance, ensure sustainability of businesses, and maximise growth opportunities. This activity has so far resulted in the training of 87 SMEs leaders, 47% of whom reported increased turnover, with an estimated 236 jobs created as a result **\(S07\).** 

 **d. Practice and financial literacy in the UK** 

 Our research enabled Aston Reinvestment Trust Business Loans \(ART\) “to reposition our business in the light of the new Government start up loan programme … We have revised and better prepared our literature and website” **\(S08\)**. This has assisted in informing potential applicants as to ‘what information is important’, helping guide entrepreneurs to provide key information then enables ART to more effectively evaluate business proposals. Its Chief Executive stated: 

 “research carried out by academics at BCU, with ART, has informed policy and practice, specifically in relation to better preparing potential entrepreneurs at start\-up and expansion stages” **\(S08\).** 

 **e. Providing a framework for social mobility through entrepreneurship education** 

 Working in collaboration with a UK national Housing association, our research led to a new \(more nuanced\) understanding and approach to supporting women who are long\-term unemployed tenants, when developing their entrepreneurship training needs. In addition, it led to a greater awareness of the role of the housing association within the entrepreneurial ecosystem, supporting entrepreneurship in some of the most deprived wards of Birmingham: 

 “This better understanding helped inform our wider recognition of local enterprise needs and challenges facing our communities. As a result we have developed a more sensitive and tailored approach to community grant management and procurement within the New Initiatives Team, this has been particularly evident in relation to our delivery of the Hall Green Neighbourhood Network Scheme and Hall Green Families and Early Help” **\(S09\).** 

 **f. Inclusion of our best practice in leading EU guide for Entrepreneurship** 

 BCU’s work is used as an exemplar in the leading EU Framework for EE. EntreComp was established to address the European Commission’s policy objective to create a ‘sense of initiative and entrepreneurship’ as one of the key competencies for lifelong learning. Specifically, the BCU EntreComp case study used the experiential learning approach developed through BCU’s research and applied teaching guidance **\(S10\).** EntreComp has been widely adopted, globally, by entrepreneurship educators. In the UK, EntreComp is recommended by leading policy makers and HEI EE support networks, including Entrepreneurship Educators UK, and the National Centre for Entrepreneurship Education.

 1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research in financial mathematics at King’s College London has led to the development of new, deep\-learning\-based algorithms that can efficiently and accurately calculate derivative prices for modern market models that are challenging to handle computationally with traditional techniques. These algorithms can be used for both standard models that are already part of financial firms’ quantitative libraries and for the modern class of ‘rough volatility’ models. King’s College London’s research has enabled market models of financial institutions to run up to 30,000 times faster than before, allowing them to be used as practical tools in the finance industry for the first time. 

 These algorithms have been implemented by a range of financial sector institutions, including banks \(Morgan Stanley, Danske Bank, Natixis, DEKA\), fund management companies \(Synergis Capital Management, Atlantic House\), and financial education and consulting firms \(WBS, Thalesians\). The speed and accuracy of the algorithms have already provided significant competitive advantage to their users, improved risk management, reduced computing costs and enabled firms to remain at the cutting edge of financial technology. 

 This research is regarded as a game changer within the financial sector, facilitating new, previously impossible, work, and making existing processes more efficient and accurate.

 2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In quantitative modelling, there is typically a trade\-off between speed and accuracy. Widely used traditional stochastic financial models have the benefit of rapid calibration, while newer, more precise frameworks – such as ‘rough volatility’ – have proven too slow to be put into production. 

 Rough volatility models have been shown to capture many important statistical characteristics of financial time series better than the models that are currently used in the industry. Despite their advantages, rough volatility models had not been embraced by the financial industry \(prior to King’s College London’s research\), due to the prohibitively long computational time required to calibrate and run them with traditional techniques. King’s College London research has shown how deep neural networks can turbocharge pricing and calibration for existing volatility frameworks but also transform rough volatility modelling from a theoretical pipe dream to a practicable reality. 

 Dr Blanka Horvath, of the King’s College London Financial Mathematics group, has led the development of a new pricing and calibration approach, based on deep learning techniques, called Deep Pricing. A fundamental breakthrough was made in \[R1, R2\] which identified efficient machine learning approaches to speed up pricing and calibration. In this approach, the option prices corresponding to a stochastic financial model are learned by a deep neural network \(DNN\). With that, the stochasticity is removed from pricing and calibration algorithms, which speeds up the calibration process and saves ongoing computation costs: all possible parameter combinations of the underlying stochastic model are mapped directly to a specific shape of the corresponding option price surface \(or equivalently, the implied volatility surface\). The surface is compressed to a representative grid, which helps further increase numerical efficiency, achieving a speed\-up by a factor of up to 30,000. 

 Although the primary goal was to develop algorithms for rough volatility models, the results have unveiled a universal method that applies more generally to most of the common stochastic financial models. In particular, the techniques can be applied to the standard models that already exist in quantitative libraries of financial institutions. This allows financial institutions to run their models more frequently, to closely monitor the evolution of risks in real time, and to swiftly react as market conditions change. In collaboration with researchers from JP Morgan \[R3\] and Standard Chartered Bank \[R4\] Horvath has trained DNNs directly on data of stock prices and indices, which allow the removal of dependence on any particular stochastic model. This permits the simulation of price path dynamics that match market observations even more precisely than stochastic models, in a model\-free way that is purely dictated by the data.

 4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Horvath’s research on deep pricing and calibration \[R1, R2\] has been widely recognised in the financial sector as a significant advancement, as demonstrated by the author’s receipt of the 2020 Rising Star in Quantitative Finance award from Risk Magazine, the leading international risk management, derivatives and regulation related publication for the sector. A Director of Quantitative Analytics at a major European bank, stated at that time, *“It normally takes 30 minutes to calibrate the XVA \[risk management\] model. With this neural network approach, it might take seconds – and it opens \[us\] up to other models that, before, were not even considered.”* \[S9\] 

 Its emergence sparked considerable research and development, and an ongoing change in risk management and trading practices across the industry. As one leading European bank’s \(Danske\) representative put it, *“This kind of investment technology for investment banks is like life or death: you either onboard it soon or you are out of business in the long run.”* \[S1\] 

 Organisations which have implemented Horvath’s research and changed their practices include banks, fund management companies, and financial education and consulting firms. We explore some examples of each of these below. 

 <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>b</ins><ins>anks</ins> 

 **Morgan Stanley** is a multinational investment bank and financial services company with a revenue of USD46,700,000,000 in 2020 \(the second largest investment bank globally in 2020\). The bank’s fixed income business saw particular value in Horvath’s work, describing her paper on Deep Learning Volatility \(DLV\) \[R1\] as *“*an outstanding paper which is one of the most famous in the field *”, with respect to their continual efforts to improve model performance and speed. According to the Global Head of Macro Data Strategies at Morgan Stanley, “Having faster models allows us to react faster to market events which is extremely important especially when it comes to automated trading… it is also important in terms of reducing compute costs”.* \[S3\]. 

 They first encountered Horvath’s research at a 2018 conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley \( *Machine Learning Methods for Assessing Financial Risk, Budapest, October 2018*\), which led to follow\-up discussions and an in\-house presentation at one of Morgan Stanley’s London offices. They implemented a calibration engine based on the DLV algorithms in 2020, devoting 1 FTE for an equivalent of 6 months for its implementation and experimentation. This has enabled them to *have “better risk management for ‘exotic’ products by using more complicated realistic models”* \(such as rough volatility\), while for their proprietary in\-house models the advantages have been speed and stability of the calibration \[S3\]. 

 Furthermore, it has enabled the firm to do live automated pricing and combine it with other pricing methods dynamically. *“This essentially means automated pricing at the trader’s desk as information streams in, for which a standard integration pricing method would be too slow”* \[S3\]. An algorithm needs to react in microseconds to be able to do this, which is only possible with the new technology. It has provided them a thousand\-fold increase in speed: the time to carry out typical calculations of 100 swaptions has been reduced from several seconds to a matter of milliseconds. Essentially, it also allows the firm to make more efficient use of computing resources and reduces computing costs which are substantial factors in any options desk of the business. \[text removed for publication\] \[S3\] 

 **Danske Bank** is one of the largest financial institutions in Northern Europe with over 22,000 employees in 2020. The bank has deployed a general\-purpose pricing and risk engine based on neural networks in 2020, inspired by Horvath’s DLV research \[R1\] on deep pricing and calibration. Horvath presented the research to Danske Bank’s staff in Copenhagen in 2019. Two of the bank’s most senior quantitative analysts have spent a year working on the implementation, refinement, and integration of deep pricing with the Bank’s key technologies. \[S1\] 

 According to a Chief Quantitative Analyst at Danske Bank \[S1\], DLV stands out among pioneering deep pricing literature due to: 

 *1. DLV is the first paper to ever offer a tractable solution for rough volatility models, with the potential to finally deploy this superior class of models on trading desks.* 

 *2. DLV successfully applied neural network technology to resolve a problem that could not be effectively resolved by traditional means for several years. DLV demonstrated to the industry that modern Machine Learning was indeed capable of resolving some of our hardest problems, and so it enabled a vast amount of further research into deep pricing, including a substantial investment from Danske Bank.* 

 *3. DLV also showed that successful results were not obtained by a blind application of a technology developed in a different field, but a careful and principled integration with more traditional financial modelling.* 

 Danske Bank’s main interest is in the speed and accuracy of the algorithm: being able to reproduce prices and risks computed with nested simulations thousands of times faster, which gives the Bank an immense competitive advantage, ultimately increasing its market share. In particular, the speed of the algorithms enables large risk calculations on traders’ desks, providing real\-time risk assessment critical to pricing and risk management. It also greatly reduces the time spent on calculations for regulatory compliance, improves risk management and enables the bank to offer lower prices to customers. \[S1\] 

 The Chief Quantitative Analyst at Danske Bank explains, *“The addition of deep pricing enables us to produce comprehensive risk reports and shields us from mispricing or unexpected losses, giving us confidence to increase exotic business while many others are pulling out. At the same time, a fast, reliable computation of capital regulations liberates considerable opportunities that we may have had to turn down otherwise. This ability, for now unique in the industry, \[…\] gives us a considerable edge over the competition in the Derivatives business. All of this also results in societal benefits, because we can do business more comfortably and offer better prices to our customers. Deep pricing and its many extensions and generalizations \(like Danske Bank’s differential ML\) are becoming a key part of the industrial pricing and risk toolkit \[…\] and has the potential to massively improve risk management practices in the industry in the short term.”* \[S1\] 

 **Natixis** is a large French investment bank employing approximately 80,000 people, implemented a calibration engine in 2019, based on Horvath’s research and algorithms. They had employed Aitor Muguruza \(co\-author on the DLV paper \[R1\]\) on a part\-time basis through 2018\-2019: as a result, Natixis was one of the first banks where DLV was implemented and tested. The benefit has been an immediate performance improvement in in\-house pricing models, specifically faster computational times, which gives a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the engine provides flexibility in the models, and facilitates conducting R&D on the models: Natixis currently has an ongoing R&D programme based on the insights of this research. A Natixis representative has stated that *“this is shaping the way quant finance and calibration will be going forward in the future.”* \[S4\] 

 **DEKA** is a German\-based bank with around 4,600 employees, implemented neural network prototypes for simple models in 2020, following a discussion with Horvath at a practitioners’ conference \(The 15th Quantitative Finance Conference, Rome, October 2019\). This implementation was inspired by the research and algorithms presented in Deep Learning Volatility. \[text removed for publication\] The model is aimed at enabling their traders to take and hedge positions in complex interest rate derivatives. The fast and accurate calibration to market data that Horvath’s algorithm provides is the crucial component in these models. \[S2\] 

 <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>f</ins><ins>und management companies</ins> 

 **Synergis Capital Management** is a medium sized hedge fund employing around 50 people, has implemented a calibration engine with a rough volatility framework, based on Horvath’s research, after hiring Aitor Muguruza as their Head Quant based on his achievements and profile as one of the recipients of the Rising Star Award \[S9\]. This implementation allows them to include rough volatility models that work across markets, enabling them to act more quickly in the market. It has also improved their understanding of rough volatility models for option pricing. Synergis has had two full\-time interns working on this \(5 person months in total\) plus 1 full time employee dedicating 50% of his time. Interns are regularly hired to fine\-tune this process and explore further opportunities that are based on DLV. A testimonial from Synergis states that, *“This implementation shows clients that we are on the forefront of research, which enhances our appeal to clients, ultimately leading to increasing \[our\] market share.”* \[S5\] 

 **Atlantic House Investments**, part of the Catley Lakeman May Group, is an asset management firm managing over GBP1,500,000,000 in funds \(in July 2020\). They have taken a significant interest in further developing Horvath’s research. They have invested a total of \[text removed for publication\] in a research project which began in 2020, funding a PhD student to further develop the pricing and market simulation frameworks to more realistic market scenarios. \[S6\] 

 <ins>Impact on</ins> <ins>f</ins><ins>inancial education and consulting firms</ins> 

 **World Business Strategies \(WBS Training Ltd.\)** is a company which organizes industry\-leading workshops and conferences for the capital markets and treasury divisions of investment companies worldwide, has implemented a prototype of DLV provided by Horvath, following a referral from Thalesians Ltd. \(see below\). This prototype is used to teach DLV to the company’s training clients. Horvath’s research has enabled WBS to increase their client base and has led to an improvement in customer satisfaction. The research presented in Horvath’s papers is taught to WBS’s consulting and training clients and is regularly discussed at the company’s conferences. It is disseminated to conference attendees, attracting further consulting and training clients. The inclusion of Horvath’s research has boosted the attendance of conferences and trainings by up to 20%. WBS conference attendees and students on WBS trainings regularly express their interest in Horvath’s work on DLV and Market Generators since they are at the forefront of the current market practice. \[S7\] 

 **Thalesians Ltd.** is a neocybernetics and quantitative finance company, have implemented in 2019 a version of Horvath’s DLV algorithm in their proprietary software libraries, taking on a new member of staff to carry out the work. Their introduction to DLV was via a presentation given by Horvath at a Thalesians’ Seminar \(London, April 2019\). They testify that Horvath’s research has significantly increased their standing with existing clients and has enabled them to attract two major new institutional clients. Their existing clients report productivity improvements of 30\-70%, resulting from the implementation of Horvath’s algorithms. 

 The benefits that have resulted from Thalesians onboarding this research into their business include: 

-  an improvement of the performance of the existing derivative pricing software libraries by 50% \(speed and precision of calculations\); 

-  an increase in the community size by 20%; 

-  onboarding two new institutional clients; 

-  improved software development processes; 

-  a more modern approach to modelling incorporating machine learning \(ML\); 

-  improved understanding of ML and rough volatility models; 

-  more efficient use of developers’ time; 

-  a significant contribution to their marketing efforts. \[S8\] 

 Thalesians Ltd. have stated that, *“Horvath’s research is leading to an improvement of the speed and quality of derivatives pricing throughout the industry. This enables better evaluation of existing derivative products and the inclusion of new and more complex derivative products in portfolios. The use of these algorithms leads to a major competitive advantage over traditional pricing methods and ultimately an increase in market share. On our part, we see these advances as game changers in quantitative finance, both facilitating new, previously impossible, work, and making existing processes more efficient.”* \[S8\]

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 AI technologies will transform society over the coming decades. Recognising the importance of raising public awareness and understanding of issues related to ethics, communication, and trust that may arise due to the widespread adoption of such technologies, the University of Liverpool’s AI research has underpinned a strategic programme of public engagement that: 

-  **Inspired and enabled the co\-creation of the **Sprung a Leak** art installation** that received wide critical acclaim and engaged \[text removed for publication\] people at major art galleries and museums in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and Japan. 

-  **Increased public awareness and understanding of AI technologies** through the creation of interactive robotics outreach workshops that engaged 7,176 people in primary schools, secondary schools, and at science festivals, and the televised Royal Institution Christmas Lecture series that reached over 1.8 million viewers on the BBC. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 This case study is underpinned by research conducted at the University of Liverpool’s Computer Science Department on AI, and its application to robotics and law, including the work of: 

-  Tuyls and the smARTLab on robot localization, navigation, and collision avoidance; 

-  Fisher and Dennis on the development and use of belief\-desire\-intention \(BDI\) agent programming languages; 

-  Atkinson on the development and application of computational argumentation theory in the legal domain. 

##  2.1 smARTLab research on robot localization, navigation, and collision avoidance 

 The smARTLab \(swarms, multi\-Agent, Robot Technology, and Learning Lab\) at the University of Liverpool was founded in 2013. Major research topics include robot perception, navigation, and sensing. Led by Tuyls, the smARTLab team won the 2014 RoboCup@Work **\[3.1\]** and the RoCKIn2015@work competitions. Both competitions tested the performance of robots in navigation tasks \(in particular, mapping, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance\), and also in manipulation and transportation tasks. The smARTLab team developed new types of modules for these capabilities which were then combined using state machines. 

 The *Sprung a Leak* art installation by Cécile B. Evans was created and developed in collaboration with the Unit’s smARTLab. Based on methods developed in their research **\[3.2\]**, the smARTLab team provided advice, implemented technical software, and significantly influenced the final design of the *Sprung a Leak* art installation *.* In particular, the research carried out for RoboCup@Work **\[3.1\]** enabled the smARTLab team to optimise robot navigation \(path planning and obstacle avoidance\), synchronization, and human\-robot interaction. 

##  2.2 Research on the development and use of BDI agent programming languages 

 The Unit has been conducting research in the development and use of BDI agent programming languages for over 15 years. BDI languages represent the decisions taken by a computational agent in terms of the agent’s beliefs about the world and its desires about what it wants to achieve. Based on its beliefs and desires, it forms intentions which specify how it plans to achieve its desires given its beliefs. A key output of this research is the MCAPL \(Model Checking Agent Programming Languages\) Framework **\[3.3\]**, first published in 2009. The framework has been under continuous development ever since and consists of a toolkit for developing BDI languages together with a model\-checker for verifying programs written within the framework. The year 2009 also marked the start of research by Fisher and Dennis into the use of BDI languages to program the core decision making modules in autonomous systems **\[3.4\]**. 

 BDI languages tend to be logic\-based while autonomous systems naturally involve manipulating continuous information from sensors. Fisher and Dennis proposed the use of an abstraction layer between the BDI decision\-maker and the continuous parts of the system **\[3.5\]**. In many applications it is the capacity of an autonomous system to make decisions that is the key novel component separating it from traditional cyber\-physical systems and so methodologies for verifying this component represent a key advance. The Unit’s BDI research directly influenced and underpinned the development of the Lego Rovers and Pyrobots outreach workshops that were created and delivered by Dennis. 

##  2.3 Research on the development and application of computational argumentation theory in the legal domain 

 The Unit has been conducting research on computational argumentation frameworks and their applications in the legal domain for more than 20 years. In **\[3.6\]**, Atkinson demonstrated how a computational model of argument could be used to capture reasoning about the facts and application of legal rules to replicate the decision made in a legal case. The case, of Popov v. Hayashi, concerned a dispute in 2001 over possession of a valuable baseball in the US and the research reported in the paper demonstrates how the judge’s legal reasoning can be faithfully captured within the computational model. Such models can be transformed into software programs to automatically decide and explain outcomes of legal cases, given the set of facts relevant to a particular case. Atkinson discussed her research on applying legal reasoning to the Popov v. Hayashi case **\[3.6\]** in the 2019 Royal Institution Christmas Lecture series.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 To raise public awareness and understanding of issues associated with the widespread adoption of AI technologies, the Unit’s AI research has underpinned strategic public engagement that has: 

-  **Inspired and enabled the co\-creation of the **Sprung a Leak** art installation** by multi\-award\-winning artist Cécile B. Evans that toured major art galleries and museums in the UK, Belgium, Germany, and Japan, and engaged <ins>\[text removed for publication\]</ins> <ins>visitors</ins> 

-  **Increased public awareness and understanding of AI technologies** through robotics outreach workshops and the televised 2019 Royal Institution Christmas Lecture series 

##  4.1 Inspired and enabled the co\-creation of the *Sprung a Leak* art installation 

 To engage the public with ethical issues related to AI technologies, the Unit’s computer scientists inspired and enabled the co\-creation of the *Sprung a Leak* art installation by internationally\-acclaimed and multi\-award\-winning artist Cécile B. Evans. The *Sprung a Leak* art installation is a three\-part, fully\-automated play performed by three Pepper robots and three humans **\[5.1, 5.2\]**. It explores issues related to the movement of data, AI, and the relationship between humans and machines through an art installation that is part performance and part exhibit. *Sprung a Leak* was born out of a collaboration between Evans, Tate Liverpool, and the smART lab, and was underpinned by the Unit’s research on robot localization, navigation, and collision avoidance **\[3.1, 3.2, 5.2\]**. Tate Liverpool stated that it “ *simply wouldn’t have been possible without the collaboration with the University of Liverpool*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 *Sprung a Leak* opened at Tate Liverpool in October 2016 and ran until March 2017, and engaged \[text removed for publication\] visitors **\[5.1\]**. The exhibition significantly raised public awareness of ethical issues related to AI and robotics for visitors, creating a lasting impact **\[5.2\]**. “ *I still get emails from members of the public who saw Sprung a Leak and say that it's really stuck with them on an emotional level*,” said Evans **\[5.2\]**. 

 The collaboration changed creative practice for Tate as an organisation. “ *Sprung a Leak also changed the way in which Tate thinks about the power of digital and AI as well as the ways that it can be used*,” said Tate Liverpool’s Curator of Exhibitions & Displays **\[5.1\]**. “ *This has changed the way in which Tate is thinking about the forms of artistic expression… Sprung a Leak allowed the art world to recognise that Tate Liverpool is \[supporting\] contemporary artists to address issues which are cutting edge*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 *Sprung a Leak* at Tate Liverpool was very well received by national and international media, and attracted “ *20 pieces of coverage within prestigious outlets such as The Guardian, London Review of Books, and Berlin Art Link*” **\[5.1\]**. Vice Magazine **\[5.3a\]** described *Sprung a Leak* as, “ *a vision of the near\-future*”, offering “ *a more positive perspective on AI technology.*” 

 *Sprung a Leak* was then exhibited worldwide; first as a solo exhibition at Museum Leuven in Belgium between June 2017 and November 2017 \(\[text removed for publication\] visitors\) **\[5.4\]**, and then as part of large exhibitions at Haus der Kunst in Munich, Germany between March 2018 and August 2018 \(\[text removed for publication\] visitors\) **\[5.3b\]**, and at Art Tower Mito in Ibaraki, Japan between February 2018 and May 2018 \(\[text removed for publication\] visitors\) **\[5.4\]**. In total, \[text removed for publication\] visitors engaged with *Sprung a Leak* around the world. “ *The reaction… within the art world was amazing*,” said Evans, “ *we really managed to achieve something unique*” **\[5.2\].** 

 At Museum Leuven, *Sprung a Leak* “ *was a big success with visitors*”, said their Curator **\[5.4\]**. “ *The robots performing Sprung a Leak became the public’s favourites at M – Museum Leuven: people would come back several times to show Sprung a Leak to friends or family*.” Due to its success, in 2017 *Sprung a Leak* was “ *nominated by the Belgian Association of Art Critics as one of the three best shows of the year in Belgium*” **\[5.4\]**. 

 At Art Tower Mito in Japan, *Sprung a Leak* “ *made visitors aware of the issues that the advancement of digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, can also introduce*,” according to their former Curator who commissioned the installation in 2018 **\[5.5\]**. “ *Thanks to the work of the Liverpool University computer scientists, Sprung a Leak was the first time that Pepper robots were able to demonstrate such a high level of activity and wide range of movements to the Japanese public, which was very unique and innovative*… *The exhibition was covered by the mainstream press and media in Japan and received positive reviews by many editors from art magazines worldwide. Over two years on, there are still artists and art critics in Japan talking about this exhibition,*” said the former Curator at Art Tower Mito **\[5.5\]**. 

 *Sprung a Leak* directly impacted on Evans as an artist, inspiring, and changing her creative practice. “ *Sprung a Leak really gave me the confidence to work with very complex networked systems and programming systems, and how that relates to a lot of the ideas and more emotional aspects that my work deals with*,” said Evans **\[5.2\]**. “ *Sprung a Leak was a powerful collaboration that developed Cecile B. Evans’ artistic practise”,* said the Curator of Exhibitions & Displays at Tate Liverpool **\[5.1\]**. “ *Her world changed because of the collaboration involving the University of Liverpool*” **\[5.1\]**. 

 Evans stimulated and participated in public debates at Tate Liverpool, Museum Leuven, and Haus der Kunst to explore the ethical and social issues related to AI technology and robotics that her work addressed **\[5.2\]**. In total, Evans delivered talks dedicated to or featuring *Sprung a Leak* at over 30 major art institutions worldwide, including in China, Switzerland, and the UAE **\[5.2\]**. 

##  4.2 Increased public awareness and understanding of issues related to AI technologies 

 To increase public awareness and understanding of ethical issues related to AI technologies, the Unit’s AI researchers embarked upon a programme of public engagement activities which included hands\-on robotic outreach workshops that directly engaged 7,176 people, and the 2019 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures that showcased AI and law research to 1.8 million viewers. 

 <ins>Increasing understanding through</ins> <ins>robotics outreach workshops for schools and science festivals</ins> 

 Underpinned by the Unit’s research on BDI and the MCAPL Framework **\[3.4\]**, Dennis designed, created, and delivered robotics outreach workshops for schools to provide a real\-life application of AI. The outreach workshops comprised of two activities: Lego Rovers and Pyrobots. 

 Lego Rovers is a bespoke, hands\-on robotics and AI outreach workshop that allows young people to navigate their own space rover, learn about time delay effects between the Earth, the Moon, and Mars, and experiment with logical rules based on the Unit’s research on BDI **\[3.4\]**. Lego Rovers is delivered in schools to primary and secondary pupils, engaging 4,704 young people between the ages of 7 and 14 between 2015 and 2020 **\[5.6a\]**. Lego Rovers is also demonstrated at UK science festivals and events including the Cheltenham Science Festival, Manchester Science Festival, and at the Science and Industry Museum, that engaged a further 1,992 people between 2015 and 2020 **\[5.6a\]**. 

 Feedback from teachers indicates that the Lego Rovers workshops stimulated discussions around AI and robotics, created an awareness of the way that robotic systems work, and increased interest and enthusiasm for programming and computer science. “ *The workshop was great and in particular the children really enjoyed the scientific discussion about how Lego rovers are similar to those used in space*,” said one teacher, “ *They developed their understanding of different inputs and outputs and also it helped them with their debugging skills*” **\[5.7\]**. 

 Other school teachers described the workshops as a “ *wonderful experience”,* commenting that their children were “ *instantly captivated by the LEGO Rovers*”, noted that they “ *added to the children's enthusiasm and enhanced the topic greatly*”, that “ *pupils were inspired by… being able to see how robotics were used in real life*”, and that the “ *discussions relating to science and space were interesting, relevant and helped to join up their understanding*” **\[5.7\]**. 

 Pyrobots is a robotics outreach workshop that engages secondary school pupils with the Python programming language through the control of a small robot using Raspberry Pis \(the Initio and the Pi2Go\). The workshop is delivered by the Unit’s researchers, either within a classroom or on the University campus, and engaged 480 secondary school children from 2018 to 2020 **\[5.6a\]**. 

 The Pyrobots workshop was delivered by Dennis in 2020 as part of the *OxNet* national access and widening participation initiative “ *that engages young people from non\-traditional higher education backgrounds*” **\[5.8\].** The OxNet workshop engaged Year 12 pupils from “ *regions of social deprivation*” in the North West and London. The pupils were able to put their “ *learning into practice and gain invaluable experience in programming and robotics from home. This is thanks to Dr Louise Dennis,*” according to OxNet’s Administrator **\[5.8\]**. One pupil commented that “ *with Dr. Dennis and this course, we were able to actually write our own* \[…\] *algorithms*… *until finally we were programming the learning rate of this amazing little robot*” **\[5.8\]**. 

 The software for Lego Rovers, together with manuals and workbooks, is available for students and teachers to download for free, and has been used by NASA \(2014\) and the FAIR\-SPACE Hub \(2019\) **\[5.6b\]** – the UK’s national research centre on autonomous robotics for space missions. Lego Rovers was featured as an example of outreach best practice in two YouTube videos published by the STEM Ambassador scheme in 2014 that are used as training materials for their UK network of 19 STEM Ambassador Hubs **\[5.6c\]**. 

###  Increasing public awareness through the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture series 2019 

 The Royal Institution’s “ *engaging and mind\-expanding*” annual Christmas lectures for children and adults have been running since 1825, and are also the “ *oldest science TV series in the world*.” Recognising her AI and Law research expertise, the Royal Institution invited Atkinson to take part in their final 2019 Christmas lecture, which explored the limits of maths and issues around ethics and trust **\[5.9\]**. Atkinson used the Popov v. Hayashi case and her research on modelling it using computational argumentation frameworks **\[3.6\]** to engage the public with trust and ethical issues in AI. Atkinson emphasised the need to account for arguments based on social values in AI decision support software for legal applications; a key feature of her research. 

 “*We \[were\] delighted to have Prof Atkinson contribute to the 2019 Christmas Lectures on the important and engaging topic of trust in Al and Law research and applications*,” said the Royal Institution’s Head of Education **\[5.9\]**. The lecture was broadcast on BBC Four in December 2019 and streamed on BBC iPlayer for seven days. The broadcast was watched by 1.8 million people and was “ *one of the most watched factual programmes on BBC Four for the entire year*” **\[5.9\]**, and has since been viewed 44,329 times on the Royal Institution’s YouTube channel **\[5.10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 History casts a long shadow in Eastern Europe, where national frontiers have shifted substantially across the centuries. Frost and Friedrich challenge nationalist interpretations of the region’s history through a radical reinterpretation of the Polish\-Lithuanian union \(1386–1795\). The research has attracted significant attention across the union’s successor states and advanced understanding of the influence of the region’s complex past on the present. It has contributed to civic events, inspired creative works, and underpinned museum displays to promote alternative, more open and inclusive understandings of the region in a complex, often conflict\-ridden region on the frontiers of NATO and the EU. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Frost and Friedrich have researched the Polish\-Lithuanian Union since the 1990s. Friedrich has worked extensively on citizenship, national identity, and political ideas in Poland\-Lithuania, focusing particularly on the German\-speaking elites of Royal Prussia, united with the Polish crown since 1454, and Silesia, lost in the twelfth century, but which retained significant cultural links with Poland. She has published widely on the Polish\-German borderlands, and, as co\-editor of *German History* \(2001–2006\) promoted publication of articles on Polish\-German relations. Her research demonstrates that the German\-speaking urban elites of Royal Prussia, far from identifying with ‘Germany’ as nineteenth\-century nationalist history assumed, were loyal to the Commonwealth, defended the Prussian union with Poland, and developed their own Prussian national identity as loyal citizens of a free republic. 

 Frost is writing a three\-volume history of the Polish\-Lithuanian union for the major Oxford University Press series *The Oxford History of Early Modern Europe*. Volume 1, *The Making of the Polish\-Lithuanian Union, 1385–1569* challenged negative nationalist interpretations of the union’s formation, which see the nation\-state in teleological terms as the natural end of political modernisation and accuse the union of hindering the development of national states for Poles, Lithuanians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians. It questions the traditional Polish view of the union as an essentially Polish creation, part of a supposed Polish civilising mission in the east by demonstrating how the union was formed as a common project between the elites of Poland, Lithuania, and Ruthenia \(modern Belarus and Ukraine\), and was constituted in a series of mutually\-negotiated union treaties that established a union of unions within the framework of a common republic, and maintained religious peace in a religiously\-divided polity during an age of religious war. 

 Overall, Frost and Friedrich’s research challenges the dominant interpretation of the union as a failed exercise in state\-building and hence, by stressing the importance of the civic, republican tradition, counters the well\-entrenched view that East European nationalism is intrinsically ethnic rather than civic in nature. 

 Their work has received substantial recognition across central and eastern Europe. Friedrich’s *The Other Prussia: Poland, Prussia and Liberty* \(2000\) won the 2001 Orbis prize for the best work in Polish Studies by a foreign author and was translated into Polish \(2005\). The Polish translation of Frost’s book sold 3,721 copies in the first three months, a considerable achievement for a scholarly monograph as the publishers acknowledged \[S1\]. It was awarded the *Pro Historia Polonorum* for the best foreign book on Polish history 2012–2017 by the Polish Historical Association; the Polish Foreign Ministry Prize for the best foreign book promoting Polish History published 2016–2017; and he received the Benedict the Pole Prize by the Polish Travellers Club \(2018\) for his overall scholarly achievement. For his services to the 2019 celebrations of the Lublin union, he was awarded the City of Lublin Medal by the Mayor of Lublin and the Knight’s Cross of the Order for Merits to Lithuania \[S4\]. This academic recognition has served as a major pathway to impact.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The anniversaries of the Unions of Horodło \(2013\) and Lublin \(2019\) occasioned commemorations across the Union’s successor states, prompting reflection on its history and its legacies. Frost and Friedrich made central contributions to major civic events. Frost gave a public address at a ceremony in Horodło to unveil an obelisk marking the 600<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Horodło Union; his research was cited in a Polish Senate debate \(October 2013\) \[S2\]. Friedrich gave a public lecture on Royal Prussia and the Union at Poland’s Constitutional Court and accompanied Poland’s President at the official celebrations for the Constitution of 3<sup>rd</sup> May 1791 \(2015\) \[S3\]. They both appeared at a public event organised by the Polish Cultural Institute in Kyiv, Ukraine marking the 450<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the 1569 Lublin Union. Frost gave a keynote public address and other lectures during the city of Lublin’s own celebrations \(2019\). 

 The Lublin Mayor wrote: ‘ *It was an honour…to host…Professor Frost, who…gave… interviews in the local and national press,* \[and\] *Polish TV.* \[His research\] *had a measurable impact by disseminating new ways of thinking about* \[the\] *Polish\-Lithuanian Union and the historical relations between the nations of its successors. All of these speeches had a broad, positive impact...*’ \[S4\]. Frost was again cited in a Senate debate marking the occasion and was commissioned to write the official parliamentary brochure celebrating the anniversary and advised on the text of the joint statute passed by the Polish and Lithuanian Sejms. Mikołaj Kałuszko, from the Sejm Chancery wrote: ‘ *Thank you…for your interesting…text that opens new perspectives…It is complimented a lot*’ \[S5\].. 

 Creative works amplified Frost’s themes. His central argument concerning the collaboration of Poles, Lithuanians and Ruthenians in forming the union inspired the ambitious public *son\-et\-lumière* that formed the centrepiece of Lublin’s public celebrations. The director stated that ‘ *The narrative for our display was based on* \[Frost’s book\] *, which tells of the formation of a state based on consensus; a state that was multinational and religiously plural, built from above and below through peaceful negotiations, and not through war and conquest…Together with my co\-director, Norbert Rudas, we are extremely grateful to him for that.*’ \[S6\]. 

 Frost’s research has been central to the planning of the exhibits on the union in the Museum of Polish History, which is currently under construction. The Museum’s mission is to ‘present the most important motifs of Polish history…with special emphasis on freedom\-related themes such as parliamentarian traditions, civic institutions and movements as well as the fight for freedom and independence’. The Director writes: ‘ *in recent years* \[Frost\] *has closely cooperated with the…Museum… we greatly value this cooperation and* \[how\] *it has been helping us to achieve our goals…*the *…focus of our cooperation…was the popularisation and contextualisation of the Polish\-Lithuanian Union*… *since this is one of the key elements linked to our mission*.’ The cooperation included public debates and interviews on the Museum’s online outlets, portals with 800,000 and 130,000 readers monthly \[S7\]. 

 The research has been of clear benefit for UK forces operating in the region. Frost briefed the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards before their deployment on Operation CABRIT, the British Army’s contribution to NATO’s enhanced forward presence in Estonia and Poland \(2019\). Major Alexander Jackson wrote: ‘ *The…impact of Professor Frost on the Squadron’s deployment was significant and directly linked to the planning and execution of multiple battlefield studies and cultural & historical visits across the region…it allowed all ranks to understand how events of history have shaped Polish national identity and perception of national threats*’ \[S8\]. 

 The research has facilitated UK\-Polish and UK\-Lithuanian Relations. The Polish ambassador wrote: ‘\[Frost’s\] *research has…a wide\-ranging impact…It helps inform our work in strengthening British\-Polish relations…*\[He made\] *an important contribution…on the role of history in today’s world at the* \[2018\] *Belvedere Forum…which aims to deepen…dialogue between British and Polish civil society*… *I…have chosen to include* \[his book\]  *in my stock of diplomatic gifts*’ \[S9\]. In 2019 Frost debated Lithuania, Scotland and union with Tomas Venclova, one of Lithuania’s leading public intellectuals as part of the Lithuanian Embassy’s Lithuanian Days in Scotland Festival. The former Permanent Representative of Lithuania to the EU, who hosted the event, wrote: ‘ *In conversations with colleagues…in Warsaw, Minsk or Moscow, I gathered references …acknowledging the quality and impartiality of \[Frost’s\] insight: to the practitioners of international relations it is of a long and lasting value...History made relevant to the public. History shaping our public discourse; History inspiring different walks of life…were the features at full display in the Edinburgh discussion*’ \[S10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Farming is the UK’s most dangerous occupation with an average fatality rate 18 times higher than any other industry. A team at Aberdeen, led by Dr Irwin addressed this challenge by applying the principles identified in her research to define the non\-technical skills \(NTS\) necessary for safe farm practice. The findings were used to develop a range of practical resources, educational tools encompassing online training, a checklist tool and safety and mental health guides, which have been adopted by key agricultural stakeholders.  The research has influenced organisations, businesses and practitioners in the farming industry, through the adoption of new learning provision, and new guidance and tools, resulting in the introduction of non\-technical skills for safety in the farming industry.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Non\-technical skills \(NTS\) at work fall into two categories – cognitive \(such as decision\-making and situation awareness\), and social \(including leadership, teamwork and communication\) – both of which are key to ensuring safe and effective job performance. Originally identified as crucial for safety in aviation \(where NTS training is now mandated\), training on NTS awareness and NTS improvement is applied across a range of high\-risk industries with the aim of reducing work\-place injuries and fatalities. Farming is the UK’s most dangerous occupation with an average fatality rate 18 times higher than any other industry and 14,000 non\-fatal injuries in 2018/19. The aim of the Aberdeen research was to apply NTS principles to farming **for the** **first time**, to bring understanding of these skills to farmers and change risky behaviours. 

 Dr Irwin’s research focused on understanding NTS in aviation and healthcare \[ **R1**; **R2**\] prior to turning her focus to farming – an industry with little previous understanding of the importance of NTS and no training provision on NTS. Drawing on expertise in behavioural research assessing NTS from both a social and cognitive perspective, Aberdeen researchers \(the NTSAg research group\) conducted mixed\-methods research \(both qualitative and quantitative elements\) investigating NTS in agriculture. 

 The first step was the evaluation of skills used during safety\-critical incidents in farming.  Interviews were conducted with 32 Scottish and Irish farmers to examine skill use and lapses during incidents.  Analysis revealed NTS were important for safety, and that failure to share information and lack of awareness of surroundings were particularly linked to farm accidents \[ **R3**\].  These findings formed the basis for an agriculture non\-technical skills framework which informed further research and the development of practical tools. 

 The next stage of research involved considering the relationship between psycho\-social context and attitudes towards NTS, specifically the impact of stress, safety climate and safety motivation.  A questionnaire study \[ **R4**\] surveying 170 farmers from the UK and Ireland indicated a link between a work climate prioritising safety and a positive attitude towards NTS. It was apparent that NTS culture and practice was highly variable across different farms and highlighted the importance of specific individual and environmental characteristics to feed into developing NTS training for agriculture. This study revealed a knowledge\-gap in agriculture about the link between stress and safety which directly influenced the development of a new mental health practitioner guide. 

 A subsequent study evaluated tractor driver decision\-making by 148 farmers \[ **R5**\] across various risk scenarios such as illness or equipment failures.  Results indicated that safety messaging around tractors would be better accepted if framed in the context of positive financial outcomes or effectiveness of work practice. This has been incorporated in the interventions developed by the team including the pocket guide \- see Section 4. A final qualitative study \[ **R6**\] surveyed 57 UK and Irish farmers specifically on situation awareness requirements for tractor driving.  Key situation awareness skills needed while driving a tractor include a mental map of their surroundings, the locations of other workers, the status of the machine and environmental conditions.  Factors that can lead to situation awareness lapses included fatigue, distraction, and stress.  This research was used to create a tractor checklist tool to support farmer situation awareness. 

 Results from these studies have led to the widespread development and dissemination of resources and training for NTS to improve farm safety, which have been adopted by key agricultural stakeholders around the UK and internationally.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Impact has been achieved through the development of freely available online courses; tractor safety checklist; a smartphone safety app; leaflets; videos; and a pocket guide. Adoption of these resources by key agricultural stakeholders has led to benefits to organisations, businesses and practitioners in the farming industry, bringing a recognition of the importance of non\-technical skills for safety in the farming industry. 

 **Training for farmers** 

 The research outlined in Section 2 led directly to provision of NTS training for farmers, for the first time. To achieve this, the Aberdeen team initiated a collaboration with Lantra, a leading educational provider for UK and Ireland offering training and certification across farming tasks, including eLearning. They produced two new eLearning modules on NTS \[ **S1i**\]. The training offers practical advice and guidelines to implement NTS in farming. Since the first module launched in June 2018, 474 farmers have completed the training, making it the 3rd most popular eLearning course at Lantra, with post\-study surveys indicating improved understanding and awareness \[ **S1i**\]. Resources developed from the research have been adopted by the Royal Agricultural University to embed health, safety and mental health awareness in their induction programme and curriculum for circa 400 agricultural students \[ **S1ii**\]. 

 **Safety for tractor drivers** 

 The Aberdeen team developed a tractor checklist – a practical tool for daily practice \- focusing on situation awareness; checking and preparation; vigilance and anticipation whilst driving \[ **S2i**\], based on their research \[ **R5**; **R6**\]. The checklist is available for farmers from the research team as a free laminated hard copy, can be downloaded from the team’s website, and has been developed into a free smartphone app. Its creation was led by the Aberdeen research group in association with Teagasc \(Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority\), Lantra, and Elizabeth Creed Consulting; and supported by the Institute of Safety and Health \(IOSH\) and Women in Agriculture \(Scottish Government\) \- all of whom were brought together to an NTS event organised by Dr Irwin in 2018, and have since been regular collaborators \[ **S1i**; **S2ii**; **S2iii**; **S3**\].  Chief executive of NFU Scotland \(NFUS\), speaking on behalf of Farm Safety Partnership Scotland said: “ *Practical measures that help to improve safety on farm is welcome. The tractor checklist helps farmers and crofters be aware of the potential risks they face as they go about their work. This has the potential to reduce accidents and I would encourage all to adopt it as part of their routine*” \[ **S4i**\]. Lantra provide the checklist alongside existing eLearning courses \[ **S1i**\]. The laminated checklist was issued to 1000 UK farmers by 2020. The smartphone app \[ **S2iv**\] was launched in June 2020 for use within the tractor cab, where the majority of farmers have a smart phone or tablet.  The app webpage had 231 views in the first 7 months with the response overwhelmingly positive: an NFU policy advisor reported *‘” have just got off the phone with a farmer who employs a range of tractor drivers\- predominantly from the Czech Republic or Poland. He has downloaded the app and is delighted with it – already discussing it with his H&S manager about how to use it in their H&S toolbox”* \[ **S4ii**; **S4iii**\]. 

 **New wellbeing guidance for farmers** 

 The research on stress impacting farmer’s wellbeing and safety \[ **R4**\] highlighted mental health issues in farming. To tackle this, the Aberdeen team developed a free downloadable guide \[ **S5i**\] \- promoted by the NFU since September 2018 \[ **S5ii**\] \- focusing on stress management for safety in farming. The Lincolnshire Rural Support Network adopted the guide for presentations about their services and for use by their nurses at health screening and outreach clinics \[ **S5iii**\]. The guide was promoted in the Farmers Weekly Fit2Farm campaign \[ **S5iv**\]. Content from the guide was included in *The little Book of Minding Your Head* released in 2019 in collaboration with the Farm Safety Foundation charity, on farmer mental health \[ **S5v**\- **vii**\]. As a result of this work, Dr Irwin was invited to join the National Rural Mental Health Forum \[ **S6**\], a group of public, private and third sector organisations, supported by the Scottish Government, brought together to tackle rural mental health issues. 

 **Raising awareness of the importance of NTS for safe farm practice** 

 In order to ensure widespread reach and uptake of NTS training and support in agriculture, the Aberdeen team has engaged extensively in dissemination of their research findings. The research team’s website \[ **S7i**\] and twitter page \[ **S7ii**\] host project outputs, tools and videos. Information on the research and resources developed by the team have been disseminated widely through TV, radio, print and blogs; including BBC Landward; and Farmers Weekly \- a major industry publication \[ **S8**\]. These activities led to invitations for Dr Irwin to present at 3 industry events since 2019 and to lead NTS events for attendees from the Scottish Government; IOSH; Health & Safety Executive; Scottish Rural Colleges; Young Farmers Association; NFU; Lantra; with stakeholders attending from Australia, USA, Canada and Europe \[ **S7iii**\]. 

 **National and international reach of NTS resources for farmers** 

 As a result of the extensive engagement of the Aberdeen team with key stakeholders within and outside the UK, resources developed from the research have been adopted by agriculture organisations around the UK and internationally. A user\-friendly *Farmer Resource Management* pocket guide \[ **S7iv**\] was developed by the Aberdeen team to make use of the research findings and provide practical tips to farmers for implementing NTS. The pocket guide was provided free to 1300 members and clients of: Farmers Union of Wales; Scottish Young Farmers Association; Scottish Rural Network; safety consultants in New Zealand \[ **S9i**\] and Canadian Centre for Health and Safety in Agriculture \[ **S9ii**\]. The UK Farming Forum, representing 40,000 members, hosts the *Farmer Resource Management* pocket guide along with six other leaflets produced by the Aberdeen team on its safety page, which has been viewed 24,000 times \[ **S10i**\- **ii**\]. 

 The Aberdeen resources are endorsed by other major agricultural partners: IOSH; NFUS; Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland; and Teagasc \[ **S10iii**\- **vi**\]. The Chair of IOSH Rural Industries Group said of Dr Irwin’s NTS research and resources: “ *As a consequence of its relevance, usefulness, novelty and extensive promotion, I am aware that the advice and techniques are already being used by Occupational Safety and Health \(OHS\) consultants providing advice and training, and others managing health and safety in the industry*” \[ **S11**\]. The NFUS Vice\-President said: “ *Undoubtedly, early engagement with the agricultural community through the “conducted with farmers, for farmers” approach from Dr Irwin’s team and has enabled the final tools to be more impactful. Industry engagement with the outputs has been far reaching, and uptake of the various NTSAg tools has been seen across Scotland and the wider UK*” \[ **S4iii**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 We have **stimulated and informed policy** and **adaptation strategies** to protect Atlantic salmon populations, worth £80M annually to the Scottish economy, from the impacts of climate change. We have **transformed the management of environmental** **risk** from rising temperature on freshwater fish and their habitats by implementing the first\-ever strategic, national\-scale, quality\-controlled river temperature monitoring network that has led to the targetted bankside **planting of >200,000 native trees** to provide river shade. Our approach was advocated by the **inter\-governmental conservation efforts** of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation \(NASCO\) review group and is now being **replicated in other nations**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Scotland’s economy benefits greatly from its high quality natural resources with freshwater fisheries contributing £80M each year \( [PACEC, 2017](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/3000/https:/www.gov.scot/Resource/0051/00514801.pdf)\). Scottish rivers account for 75% of UK and 30% of European wild salmon production, and these fisheries support >12,000 jobs in rural locations. However, climate change is increasing the temperature of rivers, with risks for native fish that are unable to adapt or compete with invasive species. In 2018 \(the equal warmest summer on record\), 69% of Scotland’s rivers experienced temperatures exceeding thermal stress for juvenile Atlantic salmon — conditions expected every other year by 2050. 

 University of Birmingham \(Prof. David M. Hannah; UoB\) and Marine Scotland Science \(Dr Iain Malcolm; MSS\) have collaborated for more than 15 years. They have provided the evidence to identify the processes and circumstance under which riparian \(riverside\) tree cover can reduce water temperature extremes \[R2–R3\]. In particular, the cooling **effects of riparian woodland on river water temperature** \[R1–R3\] together with approaches to **predict the river temperature** \[R4–R6\]. 

 Following a call by the Coordinated Agenda for Marine, Environment & Rural Affairs Scotland \(CAMERAS\) for a bespoke monitoring network to improve understanding of river temperature at a national scale, UoB and MSS co\-designed and implemented the **Scotland River Temperature Monitoring Network** \(SRTMN\). The network comprised of an initial 223 dataloggers across 13 catchments delivered in collaboration with nine local fisheries organisations \[R4\]. It represents the world’s first strategically designed, quality\-controlled, national\-scale river temperature network — yielding unprecedented data and demonstrating the financial and logistical feasibility of such large\-scale monitoring \(Fig.1\). 

 
Fig. 1. SRTMN and predicted maximum daily river temperature \(Jackson *et al*., 2018 \[R6\]\). 

 By combining data from SRTMN with **new statistical approaches for river temperature modelling** \[R5\], it was possible to assess variability in river temperature at an unprecedented scale \(Fig. 1\), providing the means to better understand the transferability of models between catchments. Fundamentally, the research revealed the locations **where rivers are hottest and most susceptible to changing climate at a national scale** and the **conditions under which riparian shading has a maximum effect on water temperature** at the river reach to sub\-catchment scale \[R6\]. The key findings \[KF\] from the body of work are as follows: 

 **\[KF1\]** There are numerous controls on river temperature that need to be quantified to provide the evidence base to prioritise management interventions \(i.e. riparian tree planting\) to mitigate the impact of climate change on freshwater fish and their habitat \[R1–R3\]. 

 **\[KF2\]** The feasibility of large\-scale thermal monitoring of rivers has been proven as a means to better understand the consequences of climate change on river temperature pattern. The extensive datasets now available can provide the underpinning basis for adaption efforts by the natural resources and freshwater fisheries sectors \[R4–R6\]. 

 **\[KF3\]** Models of the water\-air temperature relationships, which vary by season and landscape, can now be reliably implemented now as a series of user\-friendly tools \[R5–R6\] **.**

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 KF1–KF3 have underpinned policy and management interventions to mitigate high river temperature under climate change and protect freshwater fish. The high\-profile nature of these activities has led to greater public understanding of rivers and freshwater fish under climate change. 

 <ins>Impacts on public policy by changing conservation practice of Scottish rivers</ins> 

 The SRTMN \[KF2\] has **stimulated debate and influenced policy** in Scotland where **research evidence has underpinned guidance** to use riparian tree planting to protect the river thermal habitat of salmon \[KF1; E1\]. Following a response to Scottish Parliament consultation and questions, SRTMN featured both in *The Environment Strategy for Scotland* and the *Scottish Budget 2020–2021* \[E2\]. Both policy documents reference directly SRTMN, for example: 

 \[the means\] to mitigate high temperature extremes \[…using\] a suite of tools to plan and prioritise bankside tree planting \[…to\] protect young salmon and trout from high temperatures associated with climate change. \[E2\]. 

 The SRTMN approach \[KF2\] was also advocated in **inter\-governmental conservation efforts** of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation \(NASCO\) review group \[E3\]. This has led since to other nations replicating our network design principles \[E4\]. 

 <ins>Impacts on the environment by changing river management and preserving fish stocks</ins> 

 Fisheries and other natural resource managers access the SRTMN online **decision\-making tools** \[KF3\] using Marine Scotland’s National Marine Planning Interactive portal \[E5\]. We have also produced a series of **best practice Scottish Government leaflets** for use by practitioners and the public \[E6; 77 active enquiries to date\]. 

 The availability of these resources has **transformed the management of the environmental risk** of rising temperature \[E7\] by enabling managers to identify sections of river networks that are most likely to be impacted negatively by climate change \[KF3\] and in need of additional tree planting \[KF1\]. Uptake of SRTMN tools has been extensive with organisations including: The Tweed Foundation, River Dee Trust, Spey District Salmon Fisheries Board, Ayrshire Rivers Trust, Cromarty Firth Fishery Board and Kyle of Sutherland District Salmon Fisheries Board. 

 SRTMN outputs \[KF2–KF3\] are used to provide the evidence base to underpin **fisheries management plans** \[E8\] and **funding applications to support new riparian tree planning** \(e.g. Cairngorms National Park Green Recovery Fund\). In a high\-profile example, it has resulted in the **planting of >200,000 native trees** along the river banks of the upper Dee where “SRTMN outputs \[were\] instrumental in helping target \[…\] efforts” \[E7\]. The tools have also guided **decision\-making on** **woodland restructuring** by Scottish Natural Heritage \(the lead public body responsible for advising Scottish Ministers on all matters relating to the natural heritage\) and resource allocation from the Biodiversity Challenge Fund \[E8\]. Fisheries Management Scotland \(the representative body for Scotland’s fishery and rivers boards/trusts\) recognised the use of SRTMN in supporting fishery boards and riparian tree planting projects by river trusts to “be a valuable tool in targeting these efforts so that we can maximise the beneficial impact on our rivers” \[E9\]. As also stated by the Scottish Environment Secretary: 

 \[SRTMN\] help\[s\] fisheries managers target work to protect stocks and increase the resilience of freshwaters. \[E9\] 

 <ins>Impacts on understanding, learning and participation</ins> 

 **Practitioner and public awareness** of the sensitivity of rivers and freshwater fish to climate change has been heightened through broad **media exposure**. STRMN \[KF2\] has featured on both national \(Dr Faye Jackson on BBC2’s ‘The Adventure Show’ in December 2017\) and international television \(Fuji TV News, Japan, in December 2018\) as well as in national newspaper articles and specialist magazines \[E9\]. The tools \[KF3\] are discussed widely on social media and generate many practitioner and public enquiries to Marine Scotland Science for further information/ advice \[E10\]. At the time of writing, the STRMN webpage was accessed >8449 times. Increased understanding and learning about issues \(including attending our SRTMN user workshops and information events\), has motivated multiple stakeholders to take actions \[E9\] towards protecting fish and their habitats from high river temperature under climate change \[E10\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Innovative multi\-disciplinary research by Professor Abbe Brown \(Law\) in collaboration with Professor Marcel Jaspars \(Chemistry\) has embedded consideration of intellectual property \(IP\) rights in the negotiation process of an emerging new United Nations \(UN\) legal agreement, regarding the two thirds of the ocean, which is beyond the control of states. 

 Problems can arise in relation to marine genetic resources \(MGR\) and technology transfer. Prior to the involvement of Brown and Jaspars, negotiators had limited understanding of the challenges and opportunities that different approaches to IP could generate to delivering provisions in the agreement relating to MGR and to technology transfer. Brown and Jaspars have raised awareness through active engagement including a policy brief and contributing to commentary on the draft agreement. They have increased understanding amongst negotiators and wider publics of what is a fundamental issue in the management of the world’s oceans. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Two\-thirds of the world’s ocean lies in areas beyond national jurisdiction \(ABNJ\). These areas are home to unique species and delicate ecosystems and the degradation of these threatens marine genetic resources \(MGR\). Current, fragmented international legal frameworks leave biodiversity in ABNJ highly vulnerable and uncertain. There is considerable tension relating to how states should balance the drive for MGR based research, which can bring about economic and medical advancement, with impact on the environment and the sharing of benefits \(including financial\) which arise. 

 To address this governance gap, negotiations are currently underway to create a new international instrument under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea \(ratified in 1982\), which will provide a global framework for the ABNJ. This Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction process \(BBNJ\), seeks to facilitate inclusive scientific research, to enable equitable sharing of benefits from MGR and to enhance technology transfer. However, a potential barrier to the delivery of equitable sharing and to technology transfer is intellectual property \(IP\).  IP confers power on private actors \(not states\) and could lead to a monopoly being held by a commercial interest over the results of innovation, and in some cases over the MGR and information about them. If the BBNJ negotiations do not engage appropriately with IP, then the practical delivery of the final agreement and its wider benefit for health and science, could be blocked by IP owners. 

 Early stages of the BBNJ process demonstrated a limited understanding of the impact of IP rights amongst the negotiators and others involved. Professors Brown and Jaspars have sought to address this by bringing together their globally recognised expertise in IP rights and its intersection with other fields \(Brown\) and in marine biodiscovery \(Jaspars\). Through building a detailed understanding of the scientific aims of the BBNJ process, they have identified the need for strategies to prevent IP frustrating the sharing of benefits accruing from information and technology transfer. Brown and Jaspars raised awareness of this problem and developed solutions that could be included in the BBNJ agreement. These seek not to change IP law, but rather engage with opportunities which exist within IP law for states to introduce some permitted exceptions and require sharing \(of resource\) \[5\]. Brown and Jaspars shaped a new ecosystem\-focused approach to IP that would restrict the ability of IP owners to control the activity of others in some cases, and would encourage inclusive innovation through open sharing of the results of research cruises used to collect and analyse MGR. Their proposals also encouraged a pragmatic approach to tracing the use of MGR and developed new strategies to facilitate the development and to share the benefits of ecologically sustainable technologies \[5\]. 

 Brown has an international reputation exploring the intersections and conflicts between IP rights, which reward and share the benefits of innovation, and other regimes which seek to address societal challenges more directly. She illuminates the tensions between the legal structures in these different regimes, and the potential for private IP rights to restrict the steps, which states can take to respond to health and climate change challenges through technology. In turn, she has created frameworks for this to be managed by crossing barriers between fields, including in developing economies \[2,3\] and by learning from different forms of regulation \[1\].  This expertise maps directly on to the opportunities identified in the BBNJ process. As a former chair and member of multiple legal and policy committees exploring the role and impact of IP and other regimes \(including Privacy Advisory Committee of the National Services Scotland \(2013\-15\), Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care of NHS Scotland \(since 2015\),  TSB Director's Ad Hoc Group on Intellectual Property Rights of the International Telecommunication Union \(2010\-2013\),  Committee of the Licensing Executive Society \(Scotland\) \(2008\-2015\)\) and being a former IP litigator with 10 years’ experience, Brown’s research expertise is underpinned by extensive policy and commercial know\-how. 

 Jaspars has an international reputation as a scientist, an entrepreneur and as a policy influencer. He has been closely involved in the BBNJ process since its start in 2015 working alongside Intergovernmental Organisations \(IGOs\), Nongovernmental Organisations \(NGOs\), and the European Commission. In particular, he was Scientific Project Leader of the EU FP7 Project ‘PharmaSea’, which explored how to make the use of marine microbial derived compounds a more attractive proposition to the pharmaceutical industry \[P3\]. Jaspars was also part of the team that developed the concept of ‘ *Mare Geneticum’*, a means of bringing about a fair and effective regime for benefit\-sharing of MGR in the BBNJ based on better cooperation, coordination and sharing of research, results and results and financial benefits \[4\]. From these bases, Brown and Jaspars have worked together to develop their innovative multi\-disciplinary approach and to present the suggested solutions noted above \(e.g. inclusive innovation; \[5\]\). 

 In order to disseminate these solutions and to enhance awareness of the need to engage with IP, in 2018 Brown and Jaspars held an event in Aberdeen with negotiators and others involved in the BBNJ process in advance of its first intergovernmental conference \(IGC\). In 2019, Brown and Jaspars attended the second and third IGCs events at the United Nations in New York and held accredited side events in collaboration with an IGO and NGO. In 2020 funding was obtained from the Royal Society of Edinburgh \[P1\] to undertake engagement activities with negotiators and others involved in the BBNJ process and with wider publics \(in Edinburgh\). Funding was obtained from the Wellcome Trust \[P2\] to support the creation of online content \(podcasts, online explainer videos\) and engagement activities \(a musical composition and performance\) to promote the reasoning behind their ideas and the means by which they can be used by government and business as well as by wider publics to understand the role of IP in benefit sharing of MGR and in technology transfer.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Overview** 

 The combined expertise, activity and influence of Brown and Jaspars regarding IP and science has changed the negotiating landscape of the emerging BBNJ agreement and has led to IP being embedded in the BBNJ process and new approaches to it being put forward.  This is a landmark change in that IP has now become a stable, if still contested, part of the dialogue. Brown and Jaspars achieved this through sharing their ideas at events hosted at the UN and elsewhere, and contributing directly to commentary as authors \(link to commentary:  [https://bit.ly/3st1gxp](https://bit.ly/3st1gxp)\) on the evolving agreement as part of the delegations of the International Union for Conservation of Nature \(IUCN\). Their contributions have informed delegates, negotiators, IGOs, NGOs, and industry experts about the problems as well as opportunities, which can arise from IP rights. They have further entrenched the place of IP in the BBNJ process by developing possible solutions, which are effective and viable within the confines of international IP law, scientific practice and needs, and the realities of the negotiation of international agreements.  Brown and Jaspars’ public engagement activities have provided a complementary form of pressure on BBNJ negotiators and others involved in the BBNJ process regarding the importance of engaging with IP. 

 **Identifying issues and providing solutions** 

 Prior to Brown’s involvement from late 2018, BBNJ documents did not focus on the high\-level question of how to engage with IP. The formal document considered at IGC 2 and the draft agreement considered at IGC3 \(A/CONF.232.2019/6, link: https://bit.ly/3bySTJG\) do now include suggested text relating to the grant of patents, disclosure of origin in relation to patent applications and benefit sharing, the relationship with IP agreements and some limited references regarding technology transfer. Brown and Jaspars identified additional issues, which warranted consideration, notably the prospect of databases, innovation building on MGR and marine technology being developed by and under the control of private sector IP owners.   This ultimately can limit access to and sharing of MGR, and of information and benefits arising \- even if the BBNJ agreement attempts to address this through referring to open access and open source approaches. 

 Most of the BBNJ delegates, policy makers, advisers and activist groups involved in and assisting the BBNJ process are experts in marine biodiversity, international law, environmental protection and science, rather than IP.  There are a small number of private sector actors involved, and negotiators from some states, who have a deep respect for IP and a strong resistance to fettering its power. There is also a perception by some that any relevant IP issues are being dealt with elsewhere \[S1\]. This combination of limited awareness and unwillingness led to a lack of engagement on the part of most states with the full range of IP issues identified by Brown and Jaspars above as relevant to the BBNJ process. 

 Brown’s input has demonstrated the lack of focus in other fora – including the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the World Trade Organization – on IP and MGR within ABNJ and has emphasised the need for the BBNJ process to find its own solutions to its IP problems. Brown and Jaspars developed solutions for inclusion in the BBNJ agreement limiting the power to prevent activity of others held by IP owners, notably in relation to research and sharing of databases. This would result in BBNJ goals being delivered in a manner, which is consistent with international IP treaties. 

 **Mainstreaming IP** 

 Brown and Jaspars, working in collaboration with organisations including the Deep Sea Ocean Initiative \(DOSI\) and the IUCN, delivered a structured and interactive programme of briefings and events to embed a new awareness of IP and possible approaches to it.  Brown’s contribution began when Jaspars hosted a workshop with DOSI in June 2018 in Aberdeen \[S2\] with the aim of building bridges between experts, academics and country representatives in seeking a pragmatic solution to access and benefit sharing in respect of MGR in the BBNJ drawing on the ideas set out in *Mare Geneticum*. The event was attended by 17 delegates, including representatives of the permanent UN missions of Algeria, Belize, Egypt \(representing the African Group, acted as Facilitator for MGR and as part of G77/China\) and New Zealand; members of the IUCN; the Facilitator of the MGR negotiations; UK Maritime Policy Unit, Foreign and Commonwealth Office; the Office of Ocean and Polar Affairs, United States Department of State and EU representatives. During the workshop, discussions relating to the challenges which arose from IP and lack of engagement with it in the BBNJ process became evident and Brown argued for this to be addressed \[S2\]. 

 As noted, Brown and Jaspars then attended IGC2 and 3 and in collaboration with both IUCN and DOSI, they coordinated formal accredited side events. Such events take place in parallel streams when the main negotiations are not taking place, and are an opportunity for informal and interactive discussion. The event at IGC2 ‘Mare Geneticum and an Ecosystem Approach: Power, Openness and Sharing’ was attended around 15 people \(country delegates and advisers\), and a complementary podcast was provided in advance on the University of Aberdeen, BBNJ project website.  Around 20 people participated in the event at IGC3 ‘Developing Mare Geneticum:  notifying, sharing, rewarding and sustaining’. The IGC2 side event was referred to in the *Earth Negotiations Bulletin* published each day during the conference, and blog posts were shared after both events for wider engagement. 

 At IGC3 IP was much more visible than in the past and IUCN made a point of highlighting to IGOs and NGOs \(such as UNESCO, Greenpeace \- members of the High Seas Alliance\) and negotiators \(from countries of different levels of development and perspectives\) that they had an IP lawyer in their delegation. The \(then\) Deputy Permanent Representative, Permanent Mission of Jamaica to the UN, in attendance at IGC3, has since said: 

 *I have found Abbe’s work in the BBNJ process \(individually and in conjunction with Marcel\) in relation to IP to be invaluable in providing clarity on what is otherwise a very complex, divisive and sometimes controversial issue with which many negotiators are unfamiliar* \[S5\]. 

 Brown also provided guidance to the rest of the IUCN delegation, country and other delegates about the importance of IP, including commenting on points made in the chamber, advising on the need for points to be raised by countries and the IUCN. She contributed to IUCN’s formal written contributions on MGR submitted in August 2019 for IGC3 \[S4i\]. Brown also took a leading role in the IUCN contribution on MGR made in October 2020 to the online intersessional forum led by the President of the negotiations \[S4ii\] The \(then\) Senior Legal Officer of the IUCN has stated that: 

 *It is important to emphasize that IP was not initially part of the BBNJ discussions, and received very little attention in the preparatory committee process. The incorporation of IP in the current discussions in its current form can be attributed in significant part to Abbe's work* \[S4iii\]. 

 The Facilitator of the MGR negotiations held an “informal informal” meeting \(this is a key part of the formal negotiation process\) specifically on the topic of IP rights during the IGC3. This was done after the IGC3 had begun and it is an indicator of the growing presence of the issue.  Estimated attendance was around 60. The Head of the Maritime Policy Unit in the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office stated: 

 *Abbe’s contribution has in my view led to IP being recognised as an important point in the BBNJ process. This can be seen from the inclusion in the two draft texts of increased references to IP, there being a special suggested clause regarding IP and some aspects of access and benefit sharing, the holding of an informal informal meeting on IP at IGC3 and increased interest from delegates about IP issues in corridor discussions and in one to one meetings.* \[S6\]. 

 In January 2020, Brown and Jaspars coordinated a two\-day informal workshop held at the Royal Society of Edinburgh, working again with DOSI \[P1\]. This was attended by 20 participants from country negotiators, IGOs, NGOs, industry and academics. In February 2020, Brown presented by invitation on IP and benefit sharing to the ‘STRONG’ High Seas Dialogue Workshop in Lima 2020 as part of the inter\-ministerial National Dialogue organised by the Government of Peru to discuss the BBNJ process. This was attended by 58 people including  academics, industry, NGOs in particular from Latin and Southern America and  ministry representatives from Foreign and Environmental departments and including from Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Panama, Columbia \[see S7\]. In July 2020, Brown and Jaspars led the preparation of a DOSI policy brief to inform and stimulate discussion among delegates and the wider BBNJ community notably regarding the extent to which the restrictions on IP suggested above could bring about a stewardship approach to IP \[S8i\]. 

 Brown and Jaspars complemented this by engaging with publics as voters, shareholders and activists. The January 2020 workshop in Edinburgh was accompanied by a sold\-out public event with over 100 members of the public alongside workshop participants, jointly exploring the BBNJ process with a panel of experts from the Deep Ocean Stewardship Initiative, EU\-Atlas and iAtlantic, France, and Greenpeace. The event involved an active question and answer session as well as discussion about how members of the public could get involved in campaigning and engaging with negotiators and their influencers, to protect the ocean and deliver an approach based on community and sharing, not private control \[S8ii\]. Co\-lead of DOSI stated: 

 *Abbe’s leadership, expert explanations and innovative ideas have been instrumental in enabling DOSI to engage scientists with the legal issues of IP and advocate for consideration of innovative approaches to address IP issues, based on Abbe’s novel ideas for stewardship approaches to IP that promote science advancement and equity* \[S8iii\]. 

 The event provided an opportunity to reach out to the wider public in new and novel ways and involved co\-creation of the ‘Song of the Oceans’, with the internationally acclaimed poet, Dr Grahame Davies, and renowned composer Professor Paul Mealor. The video of the performance on the ‘Sharing the Benefits of the Ocean’ website, promotes Brown and Jaspars’ work in relation to the BBNJ. The site provides introductions to marine biodiscovery and intellectual property, and on the relationship between them and the BBNJ. It is designed to be of use to all beneficiaries, including negotiators. Since its launch in January 2020, the video has been viewed over 500 times.  The focus on working with the public has continued throughout 2020, notably with the launch of a new podcast for the University of Aberdeen’s PodFest in May 2020 \(112 listeners\) \[S9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Heavy menstrual bleeding \(HMB\) is a common condition that significantly compromises the quality of life of women worldwide. Work from the University of Birmingham assessing the benefit of fitting a simple hormone\-releasing intrauterine coil, termed the levonorgestrel\-releasing intrauterine system coil \(LNG\-IUS\), has improved care for women suffering with HMB. 

 Specifically we have: 

1.  **Improved the physical and psychological health, and well\-being of women.** 

1.  **Changed national and international clinical guidelines** in the UK, Australia and USA which now define LNG\-IUS as the first\-line treatment. 

1.  **Changed clinical practice** as LNG\-IUS becomes the first\-line treatment for HMB. 

1.  **Reduced healthcare costs** as medical management options for HMB are four\-to\-five\-fold cheaper than hysterectomy. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Heavy menstrual bleeding \(HMB\)** is a common condition that significantly compromises the emotional and physical well\-being of women worldwide, having a negative impact on their personal, social and working routine. HMB also places a significant burden on healthcare systems. In the UK, 1 in 20 women aged between 30–49 years \(400,000 women\) consult their GP each year for menstrual disorders, of which HMB is the most common, and menstrual disorders account for 12% of all referrals to UK gynaecology services. 

 Several oral hormonal and non\-hormonal medical treatments are available to treat HMB but are associated with systemic effects. Hysterectomy, surgical removal of the womb, is also an option but makes the patient infertile, has a long post\-operative recovery period and can lead to postoperative complications including pain, infection, scarring and increased susceptibility to osteoporosis. 

 The side\-effects of medical therapy might be reduced, and efficacy increased, by local delivery using intrauterine devices. The levonorgestrel\-releasing intrauterine system coil \(LNG\-IUS\) is a T\-shaped plastic device that is fitted in the womb to deliver a continuous low dose of local levonorgestrel \(progestogen\) for up to five years. However, until the work of Gupta, it was unclear if \(1\) LNG\-IUS was the optimum first\-line medical treatment for HMB or \(2\) if the benefits persisted beyond the short term. 

 To establish the **clinical effectiveness and economic benefit of LNG\-IUS** compared with standard oral medications for the management of HMB in a primary care setting, Gupta designed and led the multicentre randomised controlled trial, **ECLIPSE** \(<ins>E</ins>ffectiveness and <ins>C</ins>ost\-effectiveness of <ins>L</ins>evonorgestrel\-Containing <ins>I</ins>ntrauterine System in <ins>P</ins>rimary Care against <ins>S</ins>tandard Tr<ins>E</ins>atment for Menorrhagia\). 

  

 ECLIPSE was the **largest ever clinical trial conducted to assess medical management in HMB** and was undertaken in 63 centres. Over 570 women were recruited between February 2005 and July 2009, randomised to receive either LNG\-IUS or usual medical treatment and followed up at two \[R1\] and five \[R2, R3\] years to assess the effects of treatment on women’s quality of daily life, which encompassed family life and relationships, physical health, work and daily routine, practical difficulties, psychological health and social life. The research delivered the following key findings \(KF\): 

-  **KF1:** Both LNG\-IUS and standard oral treatments improve the quality of life of women with HMB. \[R1\] 

-  **KF2:** LNG\-IUS significantly improves the quality of life of women with HMB compared to standard oral medications and this continues for over 5 years. \[R1, R2, R3\] 

-  **KF3:** Women with LNG\-IUS are less likely to change from their assigned therapy. \(68% of the LNG\-IUS group were still on assigned therapy at 2 years vs 38% for standard oral medication and this difference persisted at 5 years \(47% LNG\-IUS vs 15% standard oral medication\). \[R1, R3\] 

-  **KF4:** LNG\-IUS and standard oral medications have equally high surgery\-free survival at 5 years \(80% LNG\-IUS vs 77% standard oral medication\). \[R2, R3\] 

-  **KF5:** LNG\-IUS is a more cost\-effective treatment for HMB than standard oral medications and fulfils National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) cost\-effectiveness guidelines for recommendation into clinical practice in the UK. \[R2, R4\]

###  4. Details of the impact 

 We have **improved the management of HMB**, a debilitating condition that compromises the quality of daily life for many women. With LNG\-IUS, women with HMB **experience improved quality of daily life** both physically and psychologically compared with those taking standard systemic medication. Women who have this treatment experience less disruption to their daily routine, their work and their social life. Furthermore, only 20% of patients proceed to hysterectomy, which removes fertility and can lead to multiple other morbidities \[R1–R3\]. A recent study of women’s views toward treatment for HMB attests that women are “thrilled on learning that the \[LNG\-IUS\] \[…\] put there for five years \[…\] could help \[their\] condition” \[S1, participant 15\]. Specifically, we have **changed guidelines** and **changed clinical practice** in the following ways. 

 <ins> **1. Clinical guidelines have changed for the management of HMB**</ins> 

 **\(i\)  UK clinical guidelines and recommendations have changed to adopt the treatment LNG\-IUS for HMB.** 

 **The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) clinical guidelines** for the management of HMB were updated in March 2018. A key change is recommendation 1.5.2 which advises \(based on \[R2\]\) to “ **consider an LNG\-IUS as the first treatment for HMB** in women with no identified pathology or fibroids less than 3 cm in diameter \[…\]” \[S2, p. 11\]. This represents a **step change in the rationale and certainty of the UK clinical practice guideline**; the previous 2007 guideline listed LNG\-IUS as a treatment to “consider” for HMB when either hormonal or non\-hormonal treatments are acceptable \[S3, p. 8\]. The systematic review that advised the recommendation found that “alternative drugs \(NSAIDs, tranexamic acid and combined oral contraceptives\) were no better than LNG\-IUS in terms of effectiveness” \[S3, p. 66\]. At the time, NICE indicated that this might need revising: referring to our ECLIPSE trial that was in progress they stated, “the direct comparison data comparing LNG\-IUS with other pharmaceutical treatments may prove useful for determining the place of LNG\-IUS in the treatment of HMB” \[S3, p. 56\]. Accordingly, to inform the 2018 update, NICE commissioned another review on treatment for HMB \[S4i\]. Five ‘High quality’ Cochrane systematic reviews, including Lethaby 2015 \[S4ii\] and 18 additional publications, including R2, contributed evidence \[S4i, p. 11\]. R1 was one of only seven studies comparing LNG\-IUS with medical treatments that informed S4ii \[S4ii, p. 16\] and of these it was the only study described as a “large good\-quality pragmatic trial” \[S4ii, p. 19\]. Heavily underpinned by our findings, the 2018 review \[S4i\] agreed with S3 that LNG\-IUS should be the first treatment for HMB for health economic reasons — “offering the best balance of benefits and costs” \[S2, p. 22\-23, S4i\]. It also added further rationale for **defining LNG\-IUS the first\-line treatment through** **providing evidence of clinical effectiveness** including “improved health\-related quality of life \[KF2\] and satisfaction with treatment” \[S2, p. 22\-23, S4i; KF3\]. 

 In the 2018 guideline update, NICE explicitly recommended that **LNG\-IUS should be prescribed in preference to other drugs by**: 

 \(1\) Describing it as the “first treatment”; 

 \(2\) Isolating it from the other drugs which are listed separately in recommendation 1.5.3; 

 \(3\) Removing order of consideration from among the other drugs, and 

 \(4\) Making offering the alternative drugs conditional upon the woman either declining an LNG\-IUS or being unsuitable. 

 To aid clinician uptake of their recommendations, NICE featured their guidance on the use of LNG\-IUS in the June 2018 issue of their monthly prescribing bulletin ‘NICE Bites’ \[S5\]. 

 **\(ii\) Internationally clinical guidelines and recommendations have changed to adopt the treatment LNG\-IUS for HMB.** 

 Specifically: 

-  In the USA, the 2015 **American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists \(ACOG\)** gynaecology expert review on the medical management of abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive\-aged women concluded LNG\-IUS has “high efficacy” for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding and lists LNG\-IUS first among eight therapies for HMB without underlying systemic cause. It states that “in women with HMB, quality of life is improved remarkably when the LNG\-IUS is used” \[S6i; R1\]. 

-  In Canada, the 2016 **Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series**, said that “The LNG\-IUS works well and costs less compared with other options to treat heavy menstrual bleeding \[…\] Funding the LNG\-IUS to treat heavy menstrual bleeding would result in cost savings to the Ontario health care system” \[S6ii; R1, R2\]. 

-  In Australasia, **The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists \(RANZCOG\)** said in 2018 “the most effective hormone method is the intrauterine device \(LNG\-IUS\)” \[S6iii; KF2\]. 

-  In New Zealand, University of Auckland Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Co\-ordinating Editor of Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility said: “The mainstay of treatment \[for women with HMB\] used to be hysterectomy. With the introduction of the LNG\-IUS device there are now several other options \[besides hysterectomy\] for women with HMB” \[S6iv; R1\]. 

 <ins> **2. Clinical practice for the management of HMB has changed.**</ins> 

 We have **changed clinical practice** across the UK. **NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups \(CCGs\) and Trusts revised the guidelines in their policy statements** on the use of hysterectomy for HMB following our findings \[S2; KF1, KF2\] so that **hysterectomy for HMB** **would only be funded if several criteria were met, including the trial of an intrauterine system or LNG\-IUS for at least six months** \(unless contraindicated or declined by the patient\) \[S7\]. 

 A National Institute for Health Research \(NIHR\) **‘Signal’ report** \[S8\], accompanied by an expert commentary from Gupta, assisted the making of these decisions by communicating to the public and policy makers the message that *“*The LNG\-IUS is more effective than oral medication as a treatment for HMB” \[S4ii, S8; KF2\]. The guidance was made **nationwide policy for clinical practice** when the **NHS released a verifying statement** in November 2018 directing all CCGs across England to follow the latest NICE guidance for HMB assessment and management \[S2\] and only consider hysterectomy when “other treatment options have failed; are contradicted; there is a wish for amenorrhoea \(no periods\); the woman \(who has been fully informed\) requests it; the woman no longer wishes to retain her uterus and fertility” \[S9, p. 30\]. 

 Implementation of this change to practice has important **economic benefit by reducing treatment costs** as LNG\-IUS and other medications are four\-to\-five\-fold lower in cost than hysterectomy \[R4\]. As evidence of **uptake into practice** a statement from the Royal College of General Practitioners \(RCGP\) has confirmed that “GPs across the country are using these treatments \[i.e. LNG\-IUS\] within primary care” and the clinical policy lead herself reported having “fitted 45 LNG\-IUS over the last year, even continuing through the pandemic” \[S10\]. In New Zealand, the LNG\-IUS is now under government\-subsidised funding, so is free in that country \[S1\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research by Dr Joyce \(Zhe\) Jiang, a specialist in employment relations at the University of York, increased understanding of the plight of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\) as a form of modern slavery. It also demonstrated how ‘participatory art’ can help groups such as MDWs mobilize themselves and acquire collective identity and purpose. MDWs in London worked with Jiang to develop a video documentary highlighting their experiences, which was exhibited at galleries and museums across the UK. Through participatory art, Jiang has helped MDWs: raise public awareness of their plight; empower themselves and their associations towards improving terms and conditions; and advance the campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Research by Jiang at the University of York \(UoY\) has significantly contributed to understanding the experiences of migrant domestic workers \(MDWs\), and how they might use participatory art to collectively organize themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions and influence policy. In the UK, there is growing concern that the decline in traditional labour organizing and collective bargaining has left large numbers of workers vulnerable to intensified forms of exploitation. This is especially the case with MDWs, such as, nannies, cooks and cleaners who live in accommodation provided by their employer. Typically, MDWs are not members of unions and do not benefit from the protection of domestic employment laws. 

 Drawing on insights from employment relations and the sociology of work, Jiang’s research has helped to understand the experiences of these workers as a form of modern slavery. A survey of MDWs conducted in early 2019, by Jiang at UoY, revealed that 59% suffered from physical, verbal or sexual abuse at work, and also that a majority of employers did not comply with the National Minimum Wage **\[A\]**. In the employment relations literature, it is often assumed that groups such as MDWs, isolated in the homes of their employers, lack a collective identity and are hard to organize in conventional ways that could improve working conditions, for example, through membership of unions. However, in earlier work \(prior to joining York in 2016\), Jiang \(with Korczynski, University of Nottingham\) had challenged the assumption that MDWs were ‘un\-organizable’ and highlighted ways in which these workers can mobilize themselves to articulate their shared experiences and pursue collective interests. 

 Research conducted at York by Jiang built on these ideas to explore how ‘participatory art’ can be a powerful tool in collective organizing. Key ideas were developed in *‘The art of labour organizing’*, published in the leading journal *Human Relations* **\[B\]**. Jiang explores the role that ‘participatory art’ can play in supporting and enhancing *‘flat organizing,’* which she defines as a process that emerges from social relationships between workers interacting with each other in the wider community. Examples include social movements or grassroots protest groups that \(initially at least\) have no formal leadership or structure. In the employment context, flat organizing might occur when groups of workers come together informally and develop a sense of community, initially without the help of trades unions. Jiang’s interest in participatory art was partly inspired by the critical mass of researchers at York, led by Professor Stephen Linstead, interested in the role of aesthetics for understanding organizations and the relationships between art and research. Using an in depth case study, Jiang uncovered how ‘art practices’ \(e.g. workshops on singing, drawing, painting, writing, acting and constructing and presenting satirical sketches\) can have a significant impact on the ability of groups such as MDWs to associate and develop a collective sense of purpose. Based on these observations she developed an ideal type model for understanding the ‘ *art of flat organizing’* consisting of six elements: participatory art practices; tutor activist roles; distributed leadership; safe spaces; knowing and questioning through art; and empowerment through art. 

 In 2019, Jiang applied and further refined her ideas about the art of flat organizing through a co\-produced project with The Voice of Domestic Workers \(VoDW\), for whom she acts as a trustee. This project involved a participatory video in collaboration with Tassia Kobylinska \- a filmmaker from Goldsmiths \- and a group of MDWs associated with VoDW **\[C\]\[D\]**. Funded by an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant awarded by UoY, twelve MDWs were trained in video production. Organised by Jiang and Kobylinska, this group co\-produced a short documentary video, *Our Journey* **\[D\]**, and curated exhibitions *\(My Home is Not My Home\)* that presented a combination of video installation, photography, artworks and documents in different museums and galleries across the UK \(including: in London, L’etrangere, Stephen Lawrence Gallery, Cubitt Gallery Goldsmiths and Unite the Union; in York, Norman Rea Gallery; and in Manchester, People’s History Museum\). As a form of ‘participatory art’ in action, the co\-produced film, *Our Journey* **\[D\]** and the associated exhibitions helped MDWs organize themselves and to articulate their interests to politicians and public audiences. 

 In research terms, observations and insights from the VoDW project enabled refinement and increased understanding of the process and outcomes of ‘participatory art’ in supporting flat organizing and the working lives of MDWs **\[E\]\[F\]**. Most recently, this work has continued with additional funding awarded in 2020 by Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women \(GAATW\) to further research the plight of MDWs, their experiences of modern slavery and the ways they are organizing themselves to campaign for improved terms and conditions.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 To date Jiang’s research has had an impact in three key areas: **\(a\)** raising public awareness of the plight of MDWs; **\(b\)** using participatory art practices to empower MDWs and help them organize to improve their terms and conditions; and **\(c\)** informing the ongoing campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system. 

 <ins>Enhanced public awareness</ins> – Following exhibitions in multiple galleries and museums between 2019 and 2020, Jiang’s research has helped to raise public and media awareness of the plight of MDWs. By December 2020 Jiang’s exhibitions had attracted 1,300 visitors nationally, despite the cancellation of events after March 2020, due to the COVID\-19 pandemic **\[1\]**. Evidence from feedback interviews and surveys reveals that the exhibitions have improved public understanding of the plight of MDWs and the need for reforming the system **\[1\]**. In exhibition questionnaires, a majority of visitors \(in some cases 100%\) responded positively to questions such as: *‘I felt moved or inspired’, ‘I was exposed to new ways of thinking about things’, ’It made me want to know more about what I was seeing’ and ‘I will use/share things learnt today*’ **\[1\]**. Words that recur in visitor’s comments’ books and interviews are *‘moving’, ‘important’, ‘enlightening’, ‘insightful’, ‘powerful’, ‘shocking’ and ‘informative’*. Some visitors expressed astonishment that ‘modern slavery’ still existed in the UK. One visitor, for example, stated: *‘I think it’s so surprising and disgraceful in this age that people are treated in a way that these workers have been treated. They are not considered as workers really. They are considered as slaves in modern society.’* A different visitor remarked on how it was: *‘a really shocking exhibition. I had an idea of what has been happening…\[the\] abuses, but not to this extent’*, while, according to another, it was: ‘ *A very inspiring and mind\-blowing exhibition that reveals an aspect of modern life that has always been overlooked’*. Others were able to connect the exhibition to their own immediate family experiences and recognised the importance of collective organizing: *‘my mum left the Philippines as a domestic worker – I don’t think she has had the opportunity to share her story and her pain with people who have been through the same – I can only imagine how much it helps to join in solidarity through organisations like VoDW’* **\[1\]**. An article published in the *Guardian* on the L’Etrangere exhibition and a feature on Resonance FM radio both assisted in raising public awareness of the exhibition and the issue **\[2\]**. 

 <ins>Empowering MDWs through participatory art</ins><ins>:</ins> In line with her foundational research **\[B\]**, the participatory art project directed by Jiang to produce the documentary video and exhibitions has supported ‘flat organizing’ by giving the MDWs a voice \- as individuals, through unionization and by connecting them to non\-traditional actors, such as museum curators. 

 First, it helped to empower the 12 individual MDWs who were directly involved in the art project, raising their willingness and ability to campaign on behalf of other co\-workers. Feedback suggested that for many it was a transformative experience which significantly improved their skills and confidence. A typical comment from participants was: *‘We learnt a lot. It's priceless, knowledge and bonding every week.*', while another remarked: *‘to be part of this project…I was so grateful because at last, we can express ourselves. We let other people hear our voices, our struggles.*' **\[3\]**. Five participants subsequently became active campaigners, representing their community by volunteering and speaking at public events. As the chair of VoDW stated: *‘Some women have developed important media skills from the participatory video series. They have become very active in representing the community in various media platforms. The skills learnt in the workshops have been spilled over to other progressive activities.*' **\[4\]**. 

 Second, the video and exhibitions helped to raise the awareness of a wider constituency of MDWs, mobilising support for the VoDW which campaigns for equal employment rights and reform of the visa system \(see below\). Jiang’s research helped boost membership of VoDW to 1500 by December 2020. This is confirmed by the VoDW Chairperson, who noted: *‘The video training has attracted…new members for us. We have also received enquiries from domestic workers who wanted to join our organization after visiting Joyce’s exhibition.’* **\[4\]**. Amongst these new members are the 12 MDWs involved in the video, one of whom is now leading the media and communication working group within VoDW. 

 A further way in which Jiang’s research has helped to empower MDWs is by facilitating union membership and changing the way that unions engage with this group: As the VoDW Chairperson explained: *‘Joyce’s research has informed our discussion with Unite the Union to establish a domestic worker branch within the union...Without her research, this will not happen so quickly’* **\[4\]**. These discussions led to a week\-long event \(starting Monday 9 March 2020\), just prior to the first Covid\-19 lockdown, hosted by Unite the Union at Unite House in Holborn \(London\). This event, attended by Unite Executive Council members, included a screening of the film followed by presentations by Jiang and MDWs themselves. Feedback from it noted how the exhibition had raised awareness and also advanced Unite’s own campaign to organize MDWs and achieve equal employment rights. According to the National Officer for the Hospitality Service Sector within Unite the Union: *‘This video will increase awareness and elicit wider support for their campaign to be afforded the same fundamental rights as any other worker’* **\[5\]**. The Unite Assistant General Secretary also writes: *‘This event raised awareness and strengthened union organisation, demonstrating to migrant domestic workers that they are not alone, and that they are supported by the union alongside a wide alliance of organisations and individuals.*’ Furthermore, she notes how: *‘The film has played, and is playing, a vital role in union campaigning with migrant domestic workers...supporting union organising...and bringing together all those who want to make change’* **\[5\]**. The impact of Jiang’s work in helping to empower and mobilize MDWs is further acknowledged by a spokesperson for the Trades Union Congress, who states: *'Allowing domestic workers to tell their stories themselves in her \[Jiang’s\] video starts to give these workers the power to challenge the injustices they have suffered and shows how workers organising in unions has helped to overcome their exploitation’  \[10\]**. Overall, Jiang’s work is significant in helping to broaden the focus of unions which, traditionally, had not sought to recruit and organize marginalized groups such as MDWs. 

 Third, the research directly supported flat organizing by helping to forge new links with non\-traditional actors such as gallery and museum curators who are now supporting the work of VoDW. As the curator from Cubitt Gallery stated: *‘The film brought new audiences and conversations to Cubitt and is a great example of how art can work across and with different communities.’* **\[6\]**. Cubitt gallery and Raven Row gallery have also agreed to provide free venues for VoDW’s meetings and workshop activities in the future. Curator of the Cubitt gallery stated, *“studio spaces have been made available to support the group’s \[VoDW\] ongoing work”* and this *“sharing space at Cubitt is key to developing forms of solidarity and knowledge exchange in relation to work, education, precarity and collective organizing”* **\[6\]**. 

 <ins>Campaign to reform the Overseas Domestic Worker Visa system:</ins> Jiang’s research and work on the video has informed and energized a wider campaign led by VoDW, Unite the Union, Kalayaan and Anti\-slavery to reinstate the pre\-2012 Overseas Domestic Worker Visa \(ODW visa\). Before 2012, MDWs were allowed to renew their visa provided that they would be continuously hired as full\-time domestic workers and, after five years, apply for indefinite leave to remain and eventually UK citizenship. However, in 2012, the UK Government removed these rights to renew, greatly increasing the insecurity and vulnerability of MDWs. The campaign to reverse this decision has achieved national media attention, partly as a result of the film and exhibitions that have raised awareness **\[2\]**. Jiang’s survey report, commissioned by VoDW **\[A\]**, provided robust evidence of modern slavery which also directly informed this campaign. Specifically, the exhibitions and film increased politicians’ awareness of the plight of MDWs in the UK. As the EU & Europe manager of Anti\-Slavery International noted, ‘ *The film gives space to individuals to tell their story in their words, with dignity...it is also a homage to all that domestic workers themselves have achieved and continue to fight for’* **\[7\]**. Similarly, the former Labour MP Fiona MacTaggart noted: *‘the wonderful thing about this exhibition and the video…is a very intimate description of the horrible exploitations which so many migrant domestic workers are subjected to. They are forced to a form of slavery which is not acceptable in the UK today. All of us should do more to help them.’* **\[8\]**. 

 As a result of increasing publicity arising from Jiang’s report **\[A\]**, the participatory art project and growing media attention, in late 2019 Jiang was asked to help draft a Parliamentary Briefing to inform MPs and policy makers of the vulnerability and marginality of MDWs in the UK and the problems associated with the current ODW Visa **\[9\]**. This led to Jiang being invited to speak at the campaign launch event hosted and chaired by Labour Party MP Jess Phillips. Originally planned for April 2020 in the House of Commons, this event was postponed due to Covid and finally held, virtually, on 17 November. It was attended by 115 people including MPs and the Prevention Policy lead of the Modern Slavery Unit within the Home Office. Feedback from the meeting further highlighted the impact of Jiang’s work in raising awareness and how this was helping to boost the campaign to reinstate the ODW visa. Jess Phillips \(MP\), for example, remarked: *'It has been incredibly insightful ... we will certainly try to improve the situation which I don't know how anyone who hears this could think it's not wrong.'* **\[10\]** The Policy Officer \(Rights, International, Social and Economics department\) for the Trades Union Congress \(TUC\) further commented on how *‘Joyce Jiang's video and research’* not only represented *‘an important resource’* to raise awareness, but also ‘ *supports the TUC's advocacy to change UK law to end the tied overseas domestic workers' visa and end the criminalisation of undocumented workers.'* **\[10\]**. Although this campaign to reinstate the visa was interrupted by the pandemic, it is regaining momentum and political support following the parliamentary event in November. This is due in large part to Jiang’s research and wider public engagement. As the Director of VoDW stated: *''Joyce presented her research findings and video on migrant domestic workers in our online parliamentary event chaired by labour MP Jess Phillips on Nov 17 2020. We have also used Joyce's policy report in our call to action in writing letters to MPs to support the reinstatement of rights of domestic workers. **Joyce's study has significantly improved parliamentarian awareness of the plight of migrant domestic workers in the UK, mobilised wide support and advanced our campaign on the Overseas Domestic Worker visa''** **\[10\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Sussex researchers have designed a new global climate technology policy approach to address historic failures in meeting the needs of poorer developing countries. Globally, this new approach has: informed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s review and future direction of its climate technology policy; been adopted as a funding mechanism by the USD10.3 billion Green Climate Fund \(GCF\); and informed the World Bank’s review of its climate technology approach in developing countries. At a continental level, the policy approach has been adopted by the African Union to train African government and intergovernmental policymakers in leveraging international climate funding. At a national level, the approach is being implemented by 16 policy organisations from nine different African countries, framing national policy and practice and underpinning GCF proposals, which have so far secured almost USD10 million to fund work towards meeting international climate change goals. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Facilitating the transfer of technologies that help to mitigate or adapt to climate change \(such as drought\-resistant farming and low\-carbon energy\) to developing countries has been a core aim of global climate policy for the last three decades. It is, however, widely viewed to have failed, benefiting only richer developing countries and international companies who supply the technologies. For example, under the Clean Development Mechanism – one of the core global policy mechanisms that fund climate technology transfer – China accrued around 60% of total investment and India around 11%. Africa, including South Africa and the relatively richer countries of Northern Africa, accrued only 3% \[ **R1**\]. 

 Based on a combination of long\-term empirical analyses in Sub\-Saharan Africa \[ **R2, R3**\], India and China and inter\-disciplinary conceptual work \(developed over a decade and summarised in \[ **R1**\]\), Sussex research has both demonstrated how climate technologies can be successfully transferred, and designed a new policy approach to make this happen \[ **R4**\]. The research focused mostly on energy technologies, but also developed conceptual and practical policy insights of relevance to climate technologies more broadly. The key research insights that underpin this policy approach are: 

 1. Traditional climate technology policy addresses only two dimensions of the problem, namely technology and finance, reflected in the dominance of engineering and economics in technology and development literature \[ **R1, R3**\]. This ignores the importance of attending to socio\-cultural \[ **R5**\] and political \[ **R2**\] dimensions that help or hinder technology transfer, and the need to build indigenous innovation systems in developing countries to foster broader change around new technologies \[ **R1, R4**\]. Even where policy interventions have focused purely on the financial dimension, Sussex research has shown that aligning financial approaches with existing socio\-cultural practices of paying for technology services \(for example, light\) amongst poor individuals and communities can explain the success and longevity of initiatives \[ **R5**\]. 

 2. The research has highlighted the relevance of insights from the broader body of literature on national systems of innovation and applied this to show that, where climate technologies are successfully transferred, it is due to long\-term processes of building indigenous technological capabilities and strengthening the systemic contexts through which sustained uptake of new technologies can be nurtured \[ **R1, R4**\]. National systems of innovation provide the context within which all processes of technology development, transfer and uptake occur. They encompass the network of actors \(for example, firms, universities, government departments, NGOs, suppliers, consumers\) within which innovation occurs, and the strength and nature of the relationships between them. In developing countries, particularly around newer climate technologies, these systems are often either weak or non\-existent and need to be actively nurtured \[ **R1, R4**\]. 

 3. Importantly, by combining a ‘national systems of innovation’ theory perspective with conceptual insights from the strategic niche management literature, the research demonstrated that the ‘national systems of innovation’ perspective needed to be extended to also attend to the social contexts and the political and economic impediments to new technology uptake \[ **R1, R2**\]. This led to a new theoretical contribution, which is based on understanding successful climate technology transfer as requiring the development of ‘socio\-technical innovation system building’ in developing countries \[ **R1**\]. 

 The researchers used this understanding – grounded in new empirical analysis in Sub\-Saharan Africa \[ **R2, R3**\] – to formulate a concrete policy approach. The result was the Climate Relevant Innovation\-system Builders \(CRIBs\) policy approach \[ **R4**\]. This asserted that successful climate technology transfer requires key actors \(individuals and institutions with knowledge of local contexts and people’s needs\) to focus on actively building the innovation systems that provide the context within which new technologies are adopted, along the whole supply chain from importers to suppliers, vendors, and consumers. This should be done in ways that are aligned with, or can evolve, poor people’s existing socio\-technical practices \[ **R1, R4, R5**\] and existing political interests \[ **R4**\]. 

 The research is based on a long\-term intellectual collaboration between Byrne and Ockwell \(UoA 14 – Geography and Environmental Studies\) that began in 2009, with Ockwell originally focusing more on innovation studies and energy geographies literatures in the context of climate technology transfer and Byrne focusing more on strategic niche management literature. The new empirical, theoretical and policy insights described above represent joint intellectual contributions that have emerged from over a decade of close collaboration, joint thinking and research, including co\-convening the energy and climate research domain of the £9m ESRC Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability \(STEPS\) Centre.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The Sussex research that led to the CRIBs policy approach has had significant impact on policy and funding at global, continental and national levels. 

####  4.1 Global climate policy impact 

 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s \(UNFCCC\) Technology Executive Committee – the political body responsible for implementing climate technology policy under the UNFCCC and the Paris Climate Agreement – used the CRIBs approach to evaluate its existing climate technology policy and inform its agreed way forward to improving it \[ **S1**\]. In particular, it adopted the CRIBs recommendation that future technology interventions under the UNFCCC act as “innovation system builders” \[ **S1**\]. The resulting recommendations were officially adopted by the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Implementation \[ **S1, S2**, pp.12, 16, 18, 20, 21\]. The significance of this is highlighted by \[text removed for publication\] of the UNFCCC Secretariat, who acknowledged that the Sussex research: 

 *“…*has been adopted as a key concept in the technology development and transfer work and advice of the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism… It was also relevant in the context of the evaluation of the GEF \[Global Environment Facility\] Poznan strategic program on technology transfer \(PSP\) undertaken in 2018/19, as the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network and the PSP pilot regional centres operate as new climate innovation system builders, that connect actors and networks, provide technical and policy support and mobilize climate finance for climate technology projects *.”* \[ **S3**\] 

 One mode through which the UNFCCC recommends climate technology transfer be achieved is via collaborative research, development and deployment. UNFCCC used CRIBs to frame its assessment of how to fund collaborative research and development through the Green Climate Fund \(GCF\). The GCF is a USD10.3 billion fund set up by the UNFCCC to finance global efforts towards attaining international climate change goals in developing countries. The GCF board acknowledged CRIBs as a policy approach and agreed to fund its implementation. It also used the analytical categories set out in Sussex’s CRIBs paper \[ **R4**\] to frame how the GCF would target its funding \[ **S4, S5**\]. This includes whole sections of these GCF policy documents \[ **S4, S5**\] that attend to “building innovation systems” and “understand\[ing\] and respond\[ing\] to context\-specific conditions and needs” in recipient countries, as per the CRIBs paper \[ **R4**\]. The policy documents \[ **S4** pp.3\-4, **S5** pp.16\-17 & 32\] also directly cite the CRIBs paper and mention the CRIBs approach multiple times. \[text removed for publication\], UNFCCC Secretariat, confirms that the CRIBs approach “was central in advising the Green Climate Fund in 2018” \[ **S3**\]. 

 The CRIBs work was also used to inform a change in direction in the World Bank’s Climate Technology Programme. This programme originally focussed exclusively on traditional mechanisms, such as supporting entrepreneurs and business incubation, but insights from CRIBs introduced the value of building innovation systems to achieve broader change. \[text removed for publication\] at the World Bank, confirmed that: 

 *“*Evidence, insights and recommendations from David Ockwell and Robert Byrne's publications on Climate\-Relevant Innovation\-systems Builders were valuable inputs to the strategy of the World Bank infoDev Climate Technology Program and to the development of its program activities. The publications provided a strong policy rationale and a convincing practical framework for the role of institutions in building innovation systems that advance climate technology goals in developing countries. \[They\] advance unique ideas that cannot be found elsewhere in the literature and therefore were a significant resource for the Climate Technology Program.” \[ **S6**\] 

 As a result, the programme now includes “market ecosystem creation” as the first of its five core activities \[ **S11**\]. 

####  4.2 Continental\-level African climate policy impact 

 In the light of the difficulties faced by African countries in leveraging international climate finance, the African Union \(AU\) recognised the CRIBs approach as an opportunity for African countries to access GCF funding. It commissioned Sussex’s key research partner in Africa – the African Centre for Technology Studies \(ACTS\), which hosts the Africa Hub of the ESRC STEPS Centre’s Global Sustainability Consortium, convened by Byrne and Ockwell – to provide CRIBs training to 41 African and international climate policy makers \[ **S7**\]. The training focused on equipping participants with the knowledge and capacity to advise their governments on using the CRIBs approach to leverage climate finance via the GCF and on using CRIBs to improve the implementation of climate technology policy in their respective countries. 

 18 African countries were represented at the AU training, including representation from: 14 African government ministries; four intergovernmental organisations, including the AU, World Bank, and African Development Bank; and 16 organisations with formal roles in advising and implementing national climate policy in their constituent countries \[ **S7**\]. \[text removed for publication\] at the AU concluded that: 

 “CRIBs presents a paradigm shift for the participants in these processes as articulated in most of their comments in the evaluation after the meeting \[AU CRIBs training event\]. This methodology will open gateways for easy access to climate funds. The African Union continues to get more requests for continuation of similar trainings in different regions of the continent *.”* \[ **S7, S8**\]. 

 He also asserts that the training “triggered the development of the AU Green Innovation Framework” \[ **S8**\], which helps member countries transition to green economies for sustainable development in line with AU’s Agenda 2063 – a plan for inclusive and sustainable development. The Green Innovation Framework, which builds directly on the CRIBs approach, is now complete, with a public launch expected in 2021 \(having been delayed by COVID\-19\) \[ **S9a & b**\]. 

####  4.3 National\-level African climate policy impact 

 At a national level, as a result of the AU\-commissioned CRIBs training and two further training and capacity\-building programmes run by Sussex researchers with their partner ACTS, 16 policy organisations from nine different countries have now developed \(or are developing\) funding proposals to the GCF to implement CRIBs in their countries, or are using the CRIBs approach to inform climate policymaking and implementation processes \[ **S7**\]. Both Kenya and Burundi have submitted CRIBs\-based GCF funding proposals \[ **S10**\]. To date, this has resulted in USD9.99 million in GCF funding to Burundi \(leveraging USD21.73 million in match funding\), with an estimated 573,500 beneficiaries \[ **S12a & b**\]. Kenya also has two proposals at advanced stages of approval, worth a total of USD20 million \[ **S12a**\]. This national\-level uptake of the CRIBs approach represents a significant shift towards focusing policy and practice on building innovation systems around climate technologies based on understanding the context\-specific needs and political realities of different countries and their people. 

 Kenya’s National Environment Trust Fund \(NETFUND\) supports the implementation of the AU’s action plans and is designated by the Ministry of Environment to apply for GCF funding. It has adopted the CRIBs approach in all programme design, as the research director explains: 

 *“*We have adopted this as the approach in developing ministerial projects and programmes… so far we have developed 12 programmes under this approach and they are under consideration for funding within government budgets… One of the concepts… was shared with GCF and they have sent back very positive comments.. *.* The concept was on supporting policy and regulation enforcement on GHG emission and air pollution control. *”* \[ **S7**, p13\] 

 This funding proposal has since been submitted and is currently under its second round of review by the GCF \[ **S10**\]. Similarly, Dr Kelvin Khisa, Head of the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute \(a state corporation under the Kenyan Ministry of Industry, Trade and Cooperatives\) states that his organisation is “currently developing a GCF readiness proposal for Kenya on the development of energy efficiency regulations following the 4 CRIBs goals” \[ **S7**, p16\]. 

 In Uganda, Mildred Namwiira, economist at the Ministry of Water and Environment, states: 

 *“*We have really made progress after the CRIBS training and we have changed the way we think in terms of applying for GCF and AF \[UNFCCC Adaptation Fund\] funds. The theory of change that the CRIBs approach advocates for has improved our skills in writing bankable proposals. \[We\] are currently building on the knowledge I attained from the training to develop GCF and AF fundable proposals *.”* \[ **S7**, p15\] 

 Further national\-level examples from Ghana, Egypt, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Nigeria and Malawi are described in **S7**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Addressing United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities, Woodcock’s design and ongoing leadership of three European interdisciplinary research projects \(totalling over €9m\), has impacted on policy and implementation of new mobility strategies that encourage cleaner, safer and more inclusive transport. The research has led to: \(1\) implementation of cleaner and safer innovative transport solutions; \(2\) new processes and policies within cities to increase sustainable transport measures; \(3\) increased LA capacity in sustainable mobility planning; \(4\) improved inclusion and representation in sustainable transport planning and contribution to wider SUMP \(sustainable urban mobility planning\) uptake in Europe. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Woodcock’s research is driven by her vision for safer, inclusive, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems. Integrated sustainability planning is a major focus for European cities under the SUMP initiative. Supporting Local Authorities \(LAs\) in this process is critical. They control multimillion\-euro budgets \(e.g. beneficiary Transport for West Midlands \(TfWM\) has operational and capital expenditure of £300m p.a.\), with master plans mapping long\-term city development and the health and wellbeing of citizens. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and leadership of over 20 European partners, Woodcock’s research has combined design thinking and organisational change to help LAs deal with global challenges, meet climate and inclusivity targets and improve the quality of active and public transport. Central to her research, has been the application of systems\-thinking, empathy and user\-centred design to understand people’s mobility needs and the development of resources \(training materials, tools and processes\) for stakeholders to apply this information to mobility planning, measurement and implementation \(R1\). 

 In FP7 METPEX \(2012\-2015\) \(G1\), Woodcock recognised the need to 1\) shift perceptions of public transport \(R1\), 2\) widen definitions of hard to reach groups to include women, travellers with dependents, the elderly, young people, commuters, those on low incomes, with communication and mobility difficulties so their journeys could be recorded, 3\) standardise data collection. METPEX developed a whole journey \(from planning through to arrival at destination\) multimodal measurement instrument to capture travel experiences \(R2, R3\) across 8 European cities, and derive and validate 25 Key Performance \(Passenger\-related\) Indicators \(R2\). 

 H2020  [CIVITAS SUITS](https://www.suits-project.eu/) \( *Sustainable Urban Integrated Transport Systems: Transferable tools for small \- medium Local Authorities*\) \(2016\-2020\) \(G2\) built on METPEX, by increasing the capacity of small to medium cities to plan sustainable, inclusive, safe and integrated transport. Without one agency responsible for the whole journey experience \(R2\) and a plethora of new service providers, LAs need additional support to understand and plan appropriate, integrated, safe and inclusive transport innovations \(such as e\-bikes, drones\) to reach environmental targets and make their cities healthier and attractive. Working with 9 EU cities, ranging in size from about 17k to 2.3M citizens \(total population 5.4 million\) SUITS developed a range of tools \(R5\), based on LAs requirements to support organisational change \(Nienaber\) \(R4\), citizen engagement, capacity building, collaboration, innovative financing and procurement, data collection and integration and inclusivity. SUITS outputs \(R4\-5\) have had a significant and direct impact on LA organisation, planning, awards of new tenders and safer, more inclusive measures benefiting all citizens. 

 Following a thread in her work since 1999 and building on previous projects, TInnGO \(Transport Innovation Gender Observatory\) \(2018\-2021\) \(G3\) addresses the need for a paradigm shift in the transport sector to remove gender and diversity gaps in transport education, employment and usage. TinnGO’s Pan\-European website is a one\-stop shop for tools, resources, data and information about gender and transport \(R5\). It incorporates an Open Innovation Platform \( [www.tinngo.eu](http://www.tinngo.eu/)\) for ten national design and research hubs to gather intersectional and gender disaggregated data, and uses citizen science and codesign to engage hard to reach groups and promote tools to improve workforce diversity. The Hubs thereby act as beacons of engagement to collect and increase awareness of women as employees, entrepreneurs and transport users, and facilitate the development of gender sensitive transport innovations \(R5, R6\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The research has led to the implementation of sustainable transport measures and changes in public transport policy in six European cities: Alba Iulia, Romania \(S1\), Kalamaria, Greece \(S2\), Turin, Italy \(S3\), Valencia, Spain \(S4\), Coventry \(S5\) and the West Midlands region, UK \(S6\). Benefits have been realised through \(1\) implementation of cleaner and safer public transport solutions; \(2\) new processes and policies within cities to increase sustainable transport measures; \(3\) increased LA capacity in sustainable mobility planning; \(4\) improved inclusion and representation in transport planning. 

###  Implementation of cleaner and safer public transport solutions 

 Woodcock and Nienaber’s research has accelerated sustainable transport planning and the implementation of new technology to improve safety. In Kalamaria, the research has provided a process and tools \(G2\) to help implementation of solar\-powered, smart pedestrian crossings near four schools leading to a reduction in accidents and increased awareness of speed and sustainability issues amongst drivers \(S2\). An intelligent parking scheme has also been agreed for the centre of Kalamaria \(due end 2021\) to reduce pollution and congestion: 

 “Initially 50 spaces were agreed, but the arguments we were able to present \(through increased understanding brought about by the SUITS capacity building programme\) along with our research findings helped us influence perceptions within the municipality and persuaded them to expand the plan to accommodate 150 spaces”. \(S2\) 

###  New processes and policies within cities to increase sustainable transport measures 

 Application of innovative financing and procurement processes \(G2; R5\) has increased the capacity of cities to finance and implement sustainable transport measures \(S1, S3, S5\-6\). In Alba Iulia, this enabled procurement of cleaner vehicles equipped to monitor pollutants: 

 “*Alba Iulia will be one of the first cities in Romania with electric buses in 2022.* *Through an innovative public tender with the Ministry of Development, the city has procured 15 new buses installed with air quality monitors, enabling the monitoring of pollutants in the city”* \(S1\). 

 Through innovative procurement \(R5\), Turin has implemented sustainable freight delivery, with incentives introduced for the acquisition of clean vehicles. As a result, freight operators have experienced a 20% increase in productivity, with a 90% reduction of common air pollutant emissions \(S3\). This increase in transport operator productivity has enabled the municipality to demonstrate to other operators and stakeholders the value of investing in technologies with zero emissions. 

 Implementation of the research \(R4\-5\) through a new organisational change process has optimised trust and skill\-sharing within, and between LAs, and influenced transport policy \(S1, S3\-7\): 

 *“The biggest impact was adopting Professors Woodcock and Nienaber’s approaches to organisational change and trust. Increasingly, we have adopted a ‘bottom\-up approach’ where the management listen to employees and there is daily contact with citizens and the wider society and transport sector.” \(S4\)* 

 The research \(G1, G2\) has directed the refresh of the Statutory Transport Plan for the West Midlands \(S6\) and helped shape Valencia’s people\-centric and sustainable approach outlined in their new Mobility Regulation and associated documentation: ‘ *Towards a \(\+\) sustainable mobility in València. Policies and objectives in the area of mobility and public space of the City Council of València. ’* \(S4\). 

###  Increased LA capacity in sustainable mobility planning 

 Application of Woodcock’s research \(G1\-3\), has increased knowledge and developed capacity in citizen engagement, and the use of data informed approaches to planning, implementing and assessing sustainable mobility measures \(S1, S2, S4\-7\): 

 *“Employing a data driven approach and the METPEX measures developed by Professor Woodcock, has enabled an understanding of community diversity in Coventry in respect to public transport. Following SUITS guidelines, there has been wide consultation with vulnerable road users, which has led to a more effective implementation for the new e\-Scooter and smart crossings schemes.” \(S5\)* 

 The use of mobility data \(R2, R3\) has enabled cities to demonstrate progress against their sustainability plans, gain recognition, benefit from the award of new related projects \(S1, S2, S6\), and grow internal LA capacity \(e.g. S2, S6\): 

 *“Professor Woodcock’s focus on intelligent mobility and the METPEX measurement instruments … have informed our approach to data usage and enabled the measurement of public satisfaction with transport safety and security and public transport. Adopting these principles, TfWM has established the Data Insight Service to collect a raft of data to inform transport decision\-making* \(S6\). 

###  Improved inclusion and representation in transport planning. 

 New approaches to improve the inclusion of marginalised groups in transport planning have been embraced \(G1\-3\). Woodcock’s inclusive and participatory approaches to strategy development and implementation have been embraced by the LAs is each of the 6 cities \(S2\-8\): 

 “*Two sets of lights have been installed in areas selected following consultation with people who are impaired”* \(S2\). 

 Impact is clear in the city of Alba Iulia, where a change in thinking and policy is evident in the adoption of the’ European Charter for Equality of Women & Men in Local Life’ in November 2020 \(S8\). The charter aims to balance participation of women and men in political, social and public decision\-making and was promoted and sustained by the Romanian Hub of the TInnGO project \(R6, G3\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The collaborative art project Cumbrian Alchemy* \(CA\) has influenced the discourses surrounding *Nuclear Cultures/Nuclear Anthropocene*, highlighting the role and contribution of art practices to the management of nuclear sites and in developing suitable markers to warn civilizations about nuclear waste \(potentially thousands of years in the future\). This has included CA contributing to guidance issued by the Nuclear Energy Agency \(NEA\) to reduce inadvertent human intrusion of nuclear repositories and to support future society to make informed decisions about these sites after closure \(NEA members account for 85% of global nuclear capacity\). Further, CA has influenced nuclear practice and discourse in Cumbria \(the site of the UK’s first nuclear power station\), and through public engagement, has increased understanding around nuclear cultures and enhanced cultural preservation of artefacts, folklore and myths. Selection in the Arts Catalyst funded *Perpetual Uncertainty* programme, enabled CA to tour in Sweden and Belgium reaching 187,112 exhibition visitors and 11,182 through engagement/outreach.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 British artist Robert Williams and American artist Bryan McGovern Wilson worked collaboratively with Mark Dion \(Mildred’s Lane Projects \[MLP\], Pennsylvania\) on the *Alchemists Shack* \(R2\) project *,* which developed a range of outcomes between 2009\-2013 relating to ideas of alchemy \(R2/R3\), speculative fictions, oral traditions, narratives and folkloric relay \(R2/R4/R5\), working with ‘impossible’ materials such as alchemy, ghosts and ‘otherworld’s’ \(R2/R4/R5\), with notions of *deep time* \(subterranean, archaeological & geological deposits in R2/R4/R5\) and nuclearity in reference to the atomic, long\-term geologic storage of nuclear waste and environmental issues \(R1/R3/R5\) *.* 

 Emerging from this work and research territory Williams and Wilson developed a major project in the UK – *Cumbrian Alchemy* \(CA\) between 2012 and 2014. Funded by Arts Council England \(ACE\), CA \(R1\) was an enquiry which uniquely drew together relational strands between the nuclear, mining and renewables industries of the north\-west *Energy Coast*, with the landscape, archaeology and folklore of North Lancashire and Cumbria. The enquiry addressed issues arising from the debate concerning long\-term geologic nuclear repositories, the problems of *deep time* with respect to what the international nuclear industry refers to as RK&M \(Records, Knowledge and Memory\), and stewardship of land and place. Strategically, the project developed its archival collections to form complex relations and correspondences between the three strands of the enquiry: nuclear and other power industries, archaeological monuments, and folkloric traditions; these invoked the research and speculation about RK&M, and acted out themes in relation to the different elements of the enquiry. 

 With the intention of forming the basis for exhibition and publication, Williams, as part of the research phase, investigated and engaged with a number sites, including nuclear facilities at Heysham; the Sellafield training centre for vitrification; Drigg and Barrow; a variety of archaeological monuments including at Heysham; *Long Meg* \(Penrith\); cursus monuments at Brough; *Castlerigg* stone circle; Heysham and Halton Mesolithic sites; and castles at Lancaster and Carlisle. Dialogue with museum curators and specialists at Lancaster \(City & Maritime\); Penrith; The Beacon, Whitehaven; Tullie House, Carlisle, and other art venues such as Florence Mine, Egremont; ArtGene, Barrow and Storey Arts in Lancaster, were followed by Wilson’s residency at the Fine Art Campus \(University of Cumbria\) in Carlisle. 

 These activities led to creation of new collaborative art works featured in a series of exhibitions and talks \(S8\) and the publication ‘Cumbrian Alchemy’ \(R1\). Works include large scale *Diasec* photographs, a series of drawings, and sculpture involving the collection of stones from folkloric sites in Cumbria which were sent to New York, cast in Uranium glass, and presented in a studio overlooking Pupin Hall at Columbia University \(where the Manhattan Project began\). These were then returned to Cumbria as part of the sculpture *Ghost Stones*. A film, *Gryss\-hryggr,* was produced with Mr. John Disney \(deceased\), Chief Guide at St. Peter’s, Heysham, who narrated the *Volsünga Saga* associated with the Heysham Hogback Stone. Materials associated with the *Energy Coast*, archaeology and folklore of the region, were also collected within purpose\-built archival cabinets and vitrines. 

 One aspect of the work speculatively enacts the American\-Hungarian folklorist and semiotician Thomas Seboek’s famous paper for the American Office of Nuclear Waste, the 1984 publication *Communication Measures to Bridge 10 Millennia*. Here, a ‘Folkloric Relay System’ uses speculative fictional narratives and oral language traditions, as well as sequences of signs and signifiers \(drawing on religious traditions\) to create an ‘Atomic Priesthood’. This ‘Priesthood’ would function as a means of passing nuclear warnings to future generations. Our *Atomic Priest* \(depicted and enacted by Wilson\) was invoked to test Seboek’s strategies for the marking of nuclear sites and repositories. We took our *Atomic Priest* around the archaeological monuments of the region as a sort of magical, alchemic tourist, adding to the repository of hermetic nuclear knowledge, which informed the construction of the art work as a whole.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CA, and the associated publications, industry engagement, conferences, talks, and other academic and artistic activities, have facilitated awareness of the contribution of arts practices to nuclear sites and changed understanding around *nuclearity*, place and land amongst artists, curators, nuclear practitioners, members of the public, and across cultural and industrial sectors. 

 **Impact 1: Influencing the nuclear sector to utilise artistic approaches to nuclear warnings** 

 The long\-term storage of nuclear waste is a major international concern. Some facilities such as the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, in the US, are expected to store highly radioactive materials for 10,000 years. The potential danger of disrupting one of these sites needs to be communicated and understood by civilizations across *deep time* \(time on a geologic scale\), potentially thousands of years into the future. Nuclear ‘semiotics’ was coined by the Human Interference Task Force in 1981, and is concerned with how these messages are crafted and placed in\-situ. This task is now carried forward by the Paris\-based Nuclear Energy Agency \(a specialised agency within the OECD\) through its initiative on the Preservation of Records, Knowledge and Memory Across Generations \(RK&M Initiative\). The initiative began work in 2011 as part of a ‘Phase 1’ to 2014, and included scoping workshops, project fieldwork and studies and concluded with a major ‘International Conference and Debate’ in Verdun, France. Williams was invited to this conference to present work related to CA, to 168 global experts and nuclear agencies from 17 countries: “ *The conference \(RK&M, Verdun\) is being designed more to stimulate new thinking than to report on progress… Strands of interest to the \(RK&M\) project include the use of visual arts… It is in this context that I am extending you an invitation to exhibit at the conference, as your varied collection could form a particularly valuable input to the discussions”* \(S9\). 

 William’s contribution, as an artist, to this conference provided new opportunities for nuclear practitioners and decision makers to consider the concept of the *Atomic Priest,* and how this can serve to inform future generations about nuclear hazards \(S1\). Each delegate also received a copy of the CA illustrated book \(R1\). Subsequently, and as a result of contributions to the RK&M Initiative from a diverse group of individuals \(including Williams\), phase 2 was approved and funded to April 2018 to develop practical tools for implementing RK&M preservation. 

 The final ‘tool\-box’, published by the OECD and NEA, contained 9 approaches and 35 mechanisms as ‘Key Information Files’ \(S2\) which nations can use as part of a ‘menu’ and ‘systemic strategy’ to preserve RK&M about radioactive waste disposal facilities. One of these mechanisms – ‘Art’ – states that *“Art can support RK&M preservation as it can help and stimulate the exploration of speculative futures and the visualisation of the immaterial and invisible,”* and directly cites CA through the conference *RK&M conference* proceedings p110\-136 \(S2\). *The Nuclear Cultures Source Book*, \(The Arts Catalyst/Bildmuseet Umeå\) \(S7\) includes CA as a contributor to the RK&M debate, where CA is cited within the nuclear cultures discourse. The CA conference paper is now listed on the International Nuclear Information System \(part of the International Atomic Energy Agency\), which is one of the world's largest collections of published information on the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology \(S3\). 

 **Impact 2: Raising public awareness about long\-term nuclear repositories** 

 More recently, Williams and CA was cited as part of an article on *BBC Future* \(S6i\) *\(“a home for slowing down, delving deep and shifting perspectives”\),* and a *BBC Future Facebook* post of the article had 51 comments and 19 shares. Earlier articles in *The Atlantic* \(S6ii\) and *Financial Times* \(S6iii\) refers to CA’s work in generating oral traditions around nuclear sites. These diverse publications have enabled the public to engage with the issue of long\-term nuclear repositories. 

 It was Williams’ collaboration with an Arts Catalyst Curatorial Researcher \(S11\) that additionally enabled curatorial objects related to CA to reach a wider audience through inclusion in the exhibition series: *Perpetual Uncertainty: Contemporary Art in the Nuclear Anthropocene* \(S4\), part of an Arts Catalyst Funded initiative – *Nuclear Cultures*. For *Perpetual Uncertainty,* the Curatorial Researcher \(S11\) selected specific artists from Europe, Japan and the USA to investigate, as part of a community of practitioners, questions of nuclear technology, radiation and the transmission of knowledge over *deep time* futures \(S4\). 

 The inclusion of CA in these significant international exhibitions and fora extends the reach of this project to audiences at internationally renowned galleries and museums. Attendance figures were significant, with associated outreach and public programmes increasing engagement and discourses around nuclear issues.

 **Impact 3: Contributing to discussion and debate with industry, the public and practitioners** 

 CA additionally influenced the nuclear sector in Cumbria, including Dr Paul Abraitis \(S10\), Director of Eden Nuclear and Environment: “ *Cumbrian Alchemy has stimulated significant interest and been useful as a discussion point within Eden Nuclear and Environment’s consultancy business… this work has undoubtedly widened horizons by exposing the interfaces between the sciences, which are often core to Eden NE’s work, and the contemporary arts in a way that explores the relationship between the nuclear, environment and society.”* 

 This ‘relationship’ is particularly important in Cumbria as the industry supports around 12,000 jobs at Sellafield Ltd., as well as via an extensive supply chain. Sellafield Ltd represents 59.4% of Copeland District’s GVA, and this, coupled with Copeland’s high deprivation \(12.2% of Lower Super Output Areas are in the highest decile of indices of multiple deprivation\), means that ways of preserving RK&M and promoting debate about nuclear more generally are important for local people. Cumbria itself has been considering a long\-term nuclear waste repository for a number of years, and a series of public exhibitions \(2014\-2015\), including at Rheged Centre, Penrith, The Beacon, Whitehaven, and Tullie House Museum, Carlisle, enabled timely public engagement around nuclear cultures at a time of contentious debate and consideration \(S8\). 

 R1 \(print run 1,000 copies\) has helped to improve understanding of the relationship between nuclear, folklore, and archaeology by bringing contributors from different fields who do not typically collaborate. It includes contributions from Dr David Barrowclough \(Dept. of Archaeology University of Cambridge\), considering the concept of *deep time* in Cumbria and the future archaeology of long\-term storage of nuclear waste; Dr Paul Abraitis \(nuclear practitioners with Environment Agency/Eden Nuclear & Environment\) exploring the natural history of radiation in the region; and Alan Cleaver \(journalist\) providing cultural and local folkloric perspectives, and insights into the mythic spaces of Cumbria. The introduction is by renowned American environmental artist Mark Dion, and Nick Thurston \(Information as Material, 2014\) states: *“The book represents a project formed at the juncture of the speculative imaginary and a future so real not even science\-fiction could foresee it.”* 

 CA therefore highlighted the role of the arts, and in particular this *Cumbrian Alchemy* project, in offering important contributions to the speculations, debates and strategies involved in the communication of risks of extant nuclear facilities and repositories, the relationship to the communities and environment\(s\) living near nuclear sites; and the broader discourses of nuclearity for the near and far future.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Scots law contains a requirement for corroboration, requiring two sources of evidence in support of every “crucial fact” in a criminal trial. In 2012, the Scottish Government proposed to abolish the corroboration requirement. From 2013 onwards, Chalmers and Leverick’s research: 

 \(1\) Persuaded the Government to put on hold its proposal until additional safeguards against wrongful conviction—such as reform of the jury system—had been identified. 

 \(2\) Persuaded the Government to adopt an evidence\-based approach to jury reform, which led to the first major programme of jury research ever undertaken in Scotland. 

 \(3\) Produced the evidence that will ultimately lead to the introduction of a number of jury reform measures. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Scots law contains a requirement for corroboration, which acts as a safeguard against wrongful conviction. Its presence has been used to justify the absence of other safeguards, such as a rule requiring unanimous jury verdicts. 

 In 2010, following a UK Supreme Court decision that certain aspects of the treatment of detained suspects in Scotland were incompatible with human rights, the Scottish Government launched a major review of criminal procedure. The review was led by High Court judge Lord Carloway, who published his report in late 2011, recommending several reforms including the abolition of the corroboration requirement. The Scottish Government took forward this recommendation in the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Bill, which included provisions for abolition of the corroboration requirement when it was introduced on 20 June 2013. 

 Chalmers and Leverick drew on their expertise in criminal procedure to write a critical evaluation of the Carloway proposals **\[O1\]**. They welcomed many of Carloway’s recommendations relating to procedural safeguards at pre\-trial stage, but warned, having systematically reviewed the available research evidence and comparative practice, that removing the corroboration requirement without replacing it with alternative measures would risk the Scottish criminal justice system lacking substantive safeguards to protect against wrongful conviction. 

 This insight led the Government to remove the provisions abolishing the corroboration requirement from the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Bill before it was passed by the Scottish Parliament, and to set up the Post\-Corroboration Safeguards Review \(PCSR\), aimed at identifying additional safeguards that would be required if the corroboration requirement were abolished. The PCSR commissioned a team led by Chalmers and Leverick to undertake research into safeguards against wrongful conviction **\[G1\]**. This culminated in the publication of an Expert Report **\[O2\]**. Chalmers and Leverick were responsible for project design and management and researching and writing key chapters of the Report. They identified key causes of wrongful conviction **\[O2.1\]** and found that a number of these would be aggravated by the abolition of the corroboration requirement. Chalmers undertook comparative research into Scotland’s use of simple majority jury verdicts and found it to be out of line with comparable practice elsewhere **\[O2.2\]**. He argued for a Code of Practice for the recording of police interviews **\[O2.3\]**. Leverick undertook an evaluation of juror comprehension of judicial directions and found that while directions could potentially safeguard against wrongful conviction, there is evidence that jurors struggle to understand directions, making their protective effect limited **\[O2.4\]\[O3\]**. 

 The PCSR recommended a number of possible safeguards, one of which was undertaking research into jury reasoning and decision making to inform future decisions. Chalmers and Leverick were part of the team that carried out this research \(commissioned by the Government in 2017\) **\[G2\]**. The project had two relevant components: \(1\) a review of existing research evidence on the most effective approaches for aiding jury comprehension of legal issues \(completed in 2018\) and \(2\) a major mock jury research study \(completed in 2019\). 

 The jury comprehension evidence review undertaken \(solely\) by Chalmers and Leverick **\[O4\]** found that jurors face considerable challenges in recalling and understanding the legal directions they are given. The deliberation process—whereby individual jurors pool knowledge—improves memory but has little effect on comprehension. Chalmers and Leverick found that the most effective methods in terms of enhancing memory and/or understanding of legal directions are juror note\-taking, pre\-instruction, plain language directions \(especially if given in writing\) and structured decision aids \(routes to verdict\). Routes to verdict are a series of primarily factual questions that lead jurors to a legally justified verdict. 

 Further evidence that jurors sitting on Scottish criminal trials would benefit from additional guidance to aid their discussion came from the mock jury component of the study **\[O5\]**. This was the largest mock jury experiment ever conducted in the UK, involving a total of 64 mock juries with either 15 or 12 members, and the first of its kind in Scotland. It took extensive steps to recreate—as far as is possible—the experience of sitting on a real trial. Jurors watched a highly realistic trial video, which involved professional actors in the roles of witnesses and advocates and a senior judge \(Lord Bonomy\) giving legal directions, taken from the Judicial Institute’s Jury Manual to replicate the directions juries would hear in a real trial. They then deliberated for up to 90 minutes \(filmed, but without a researcher present\) in an attempt to reach a verdict. Analysis of the deliberations demonstrated that jurors did not always recall legal tests accurately and were sometimes confused about their meaning.

","
###  4. Details of the impact 

 **4.1. Persuading the Government to reconsider its proposal** 

 The proposal to abolish the corroboration requirement was taken forward by the Government in the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Bill. The Bill was scrutinised by the Justice Committee in 2013\-14. Chalmers and Leverick’s Modern Law Review article **\[O1\]** was referred to repeatedly during proceedings of the Committee when it took evidence from Lord Carloway \(as recorded in the Official Report **\[E1\]**\). Chalmers and Leverick submitted written evidence \(with Farmer\) and gave oral evidence to the Committee \(8 October 2013, Chalmers and Leverick; 10 December 2013, Chalmers\). Their evidence warned of the dangers of abolishing the corroboration requirement without alternative safeguards against wrongful conviction. The Committee drew on this evidence in recommending to the Government in 2014 that the provision on corroboration be removed from the Bill and that there be “an independent review of what other reforms may be needed to ensure that the criminal justice system as a whole contains appropriate checks and balances” \(Stage 1 Report on the Bill **\[E2\]**\). The Government followed this recommendation. 

 The impact of retaining the corroboration rule is considerable. Corroboration is required in the vast majority of criminal cases progressing through the Scottish criminal justice system \(a small number of exceptions apply in respect of relatively minor statutory offences\). This means it is applied in: \(a\) decisions on whether or not to prosecute taken in over 170,000 reports to the public prosecutor each year; \(b\) over 100,000 criminal cases registered in court, and \(c\) over 11,000 trials. 

 **4.2. Persuading the Government to adopt an evidence\-based approach to jury reform** 

 The next phase of the reform process involved Lord Bonomy, a former High Court judge, being appointed to lead the Post\-Corroboration Safeguards Review \(PCSR\), an independent review into safeguards against wrongful conviction. He contacted Chalmers for advice, being aware of the work that Chalmers and Leverick had carried out \(as evidenced by the letter from Lord Bonomy **\[E3\]**\), and subsequently commissioned Chalmers and Leverick to lead a programme of academic research to inform the PCSR **\[G1\]**. Chalmers was also appointed to the PCSR Reference Group. 

 The findings of the academic research led by Chalmers and Leverick were published in an Academic Expert Report. This formed the basis for the discussions of the PCSR Reference Group which led in turn to a Consultation Paper. The Expert Report was published alongside that Consultation Paper. In the Consultation Paper **\[E4\]**, Lord Bonomy states of the Expert Report that it “forms the foundation of the Review’s work… respondents are strongly encouraged to refer to the relevant parts of this Report in considering their responses” \(at page 5\). In the PCSR’s Final Report **\[E5\]**, Lord Bonomy refers to the Expert Report’s “immense contribution to the work of the Review” \(at para 1.2\). 

 Based on one of the sections of the Expert Report written by Chalmers **\[O2.2\]**, which set out the difficulties of drawing lessons for Scotland from jury research around the world given the peculiar characteristics of the Scottish jury \(see pages 155\-156\), the PCSR recommended that a major programme of jury research should be undertaken \(confirmed by **\[E5\]**, para 12.29\). The research was commissioned by the Scottish Government in 2017, who also drew on Chalmers’ work to justify committing almost GBP0.5m to fund the project \(confirmed by the Scottish Government’s Invitation to Tender **\[E6\]**, para 2.5\). It was the first major programme of jury research to be conducted in Scotland and one of the largest jury research projects ever to be undertaken worldwide. The Invitation to Tender further evidences the extent to which the chapters of the Expert Report authored by Chalmers and Leverick shaped the Scottish Government’s thinking, stating that the research should build “on the findings of the Safeguards Review and accompanying Report of the Academic Expert Group” \(confirmed by **\[E6\]**, table 1\). Chalmers and Leverick were part of the team conducting this research \(which reported in October 2019\). 

 **4.3. Reforms to the Scottish jury system** 

 The PCSR drew on the chapter of the Expert Report authored by Leverick **\[O2.4\]** to recommend that the way in which information is conveyed to juries should be improved \(confirmed by **\[E5\]**, particularly the references to Leverick’s work at paras 13.4\-13.5\). The PCSR recommended that the Judicial Institute, the body in charge of judicial training in Scotland, “note the research produced in the Report of the Academic Expert Group, the views of the Reference Group relating to the use of plain language, and the other suggestions noted in this Report and made by respondents to the Consultation, and to devise appropriate training programmes and guidance” \(confirmed by **\[E5\]**, para 13.14\). 

 Chalmers and Leverick were invited to brief the Judicial Institute on jury communication methods in October 2018 \(confirmed by the email from the Deputy Director of the Judicial Institute **\[E7\]**\). Chalmers and Leverick drew on the Evidence Review **\[O4\]** they undertook as part of the Scottish Government funded jury research **\[G2\]** to recommend changes to the way in which juries are directed, including the use of written directions instead of only directing juries orally, which applies to over 1,300 trials per year, all for the most serious offences. 

 The mock jury study **\[O5\]** has also provided the evidence base that may result in further impact on the Scottish criminal justice system. At the time of writing, the Scottish Government is consulting on changes that should be made to the jury system following from the research, which may include changes to the “not proven” verdict \(Scotland, uniquely, has both “not proven” and “not guilty” as potential acquittal verdicts in criminal trials\). At the launch event for the jury research, the Justice Secretary described the research as “ground\-breaking”, noting that it “will be used to inform discussion and consideration around potential changes to our system in the future” and that “\[t\]here is no doubt that the quality of these discussions will be substantially improved by the publication of the jury research today” \(confirmed by transcript of the Justice Secretary’s speech **\[E8\]**\). Shortly before the end of the assessment period, the Scottish Government had commenced a series of engagement events designed to obtain views on potential reforms. This work was paused due to the coronavirus pandemic but is expected to resume when it is safe to do so. 

 **4.4. Additional impact: police interviewing** 

 Finally, one further completed impact additional to those noted above is that, following Chalmers **\[O2.3\]**, the PCSR recommended that there should be a statutory provision requiring the creation of a code of practice for police interviewing. This was implemented by section 57 of the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Act 2016. The Code, once in force, will provide improved protection against wrongful conviction to over 100,000 suspects interviewed by Police Scotland annually \(confirmed by para 5.18 of **\[E5\]**; 108,000\-162,000 interviews take place per year\).

 UK nursing trainees are better prepared to deliver patient\-centred care as a result of ‘Taking Care’ \(TC\), a mixed methods drama research project. TC has so far benefited nursing educators at 16 HEIs, and over 2,500 trainees, by bringing the tools and resources to teach ethical care and communication skills into their nursing curricula. TC is also shaping pedagogical conversations in the sector as an exemplar of the utility of performance\-making methods in healthcare education more generally, and has brought arts and health practitioners and policymakers together to their mutual benefit. Consequently, TC has made a systematic incorporation of arts\-based approaches to healthcare education a much higher priority, and triggered the formation of the new, nationwide Performance and Care Working Group.

 **2. Underpinning research** 

 The 2013 Francis Report, investigating the failures of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust, detailed the negative impact of inadequate nursing care and hospital understaffing on patient health outcomes, most notably increased mortality rates. Its key recommendations included an ethos of ‘putting the patient first’, and training to ensure prospective nurses are sufficiently ‘caring’ individuals. ‘Taking Care’ \(TC\), a body of drama research undertaken by Kingston University \(KU\) and Guildhall School of Music & Drama \(GSMD\), identifies and addresses two significant challenges faced by nursing educators in the face of these imperatives: a\) how to teach the sensitive and effective communication of ‘care’, and b\) how to prepare students for the demanding emotional labour required by their profession. TC’s central output is the series of performances *Careful* \[R1\], and the project also draws upon and feeds into a body of research comprising reflective \[R2; R3; R4\] and pedagogic \[R5\] works. Because this project operates iteratively and in conjunction with its stakeholders, the underpinning research and its impact are interwoven. 

 The use of arts\-based tools in the pedagogy of other fields is fairly well established, especially in medical education, but is under\-researched and \-utilised in nursing training specifically. The Nursing and Midwifery Council’s response to the Francis Report’s criticisms promoted nurses’ cultivation of ‘compassion’ and ‘care’ to embed patient\-centred practice. However, a focus on ‘compassion’ overlooks the skilled nature of this practice, and the emotional toll it takes on the caregiver. Disregarding the first leads to low recruitment and the second to burnout, manifested in high attrition rates, ultimately resulting in poor patient outcomes. Within the existing nursing curriculum there is little attention to how trainees might ‘care’ for patients in demanding workplaces without compromising their own emotional wellbeing. 

 Nurses occupy a distinct position in healthcare due to their increased emotional exposure and the perceived lack of skill and professionalism attached to ‘care’, and for hospital patients and their families nurses are the most frequent point of contact with staff. Small gestures such as word choice, tone of voice and stance can carry strong emotional significance, especially in vulnerable moments. This was observed first\-hand by TC’s principal investigator, drama researcher\-practitioner Alex Mermikides, while caring for a seriously ill close relative. Thus there are parallels between nursing and theatrical practice, as in clinical interactions nurses and patients watch each other as audiences watch performers, attuned to the ‘meaning’ of their actions. Drawing on these similarities, TC explores the relationship between drama and healthcare education. 

 TC began with a five\-month residency in KU’s Nursing School \(summer 2016, supported by Arts Council England\). Mermikides used ethnographic and archival research methods \(including access to unpublished interviews with nurses who trained or worked at St George’s Hospital, regular meetings with nursing teaching staff and lesson observations\) to explore how nurses learn to perform care. Following this, Mermikides conducted research workshops with a team of professional performers, nursing trainees and educators. These combined practical activities to test different uses of performance skills, analysis of existing dramatic representations of nursing, and discussions and focus group interviews. These workshops form a wing of the research practice at the heart of TC: ‘devising’ \(a collaborative, democratic tool for performance\-making, its ethos underpins TC in both subject and methodology\). 

 During the devising process, Mermikides’ ensemble created fictional scenarios based on the five central themes emerging from the background research: caring too much; being unable to provide adequate attention; ‘difficult’ patients, vigilance exhaustion; and \(following the Francis Report\) fear of being judged. The ensemble used physical theatre techniques to get ‘under the skin’ of nurses by observing and embodying basic nursing procedures, and translating them into choreographed movement. Rehearsals and early work\-in\-progress performances took place in a simulated ward, with the audience in beds to accentuate the theatrical nature of nurse\-patient interactions. This device foregrounded nurses’ perspectives while putting viewers in the patient’s position, highlighting the intersubjectivity and embodied aspect of clinical encounters and demonstrating care as a *skill* \[R3; R4\]. These expressionistic and immersive elements mean that the resulting performance is distinct from the ‘naturalistic’ style more commonly used in healthcare education. Each subsequent performance has developed the show further, in response to audience feedback \(post\-show discussions, focus groups, questionnaires\) and ongoing desk research. 

 The process of devising *Careful* revealed that care can be understood as a skilled practice rather than an inherent virtue. Like performance, it depends on subtle orchestrations of words, gestures, bodies and space in order to convey emotion and meaning. Approaches used to train physical theatre performers are therefore shown to be adaptable for nursing education, to help nurses manage the unique emotional content of their clinical encounters. Above all, TC research led to a reconception of care as a relational feedback loop, countering the pervasive view that compassionate care is conferred from nurse to patient \[R4\]. 

 Initial performances of *Careful* were staged in KU’s simulated hospital ward \(September 2016\), Rose Theatre Studio \(November 2016\), and at the University of Surrey’s Ivy Arts Centre \(March 2017\), mostly to trainee nurses. Positive audience response led KU nursing department to invite Mermikides to teach the insights and techniques arising from TC via a practical class for year 1 BSc Adult Nursing students at KU \(June 2017\). Following Mermikides’ move to GSMD in July 2017, two further classes for years 2 and 3 \(launched in summer 2018 and 2019\), a headline performance in the main house at the Rose \(summer 2018\), digital workpacks \(May 2020; \[R5\]\), and a *Careful* tour \(postponed due to Covid\-19\) have been commissioned, researched and developed. Dissemination activities also include a major symposium, Performance for Care, co\-convened by Mermikides.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 The most direct impact has been on the estimated 2,500 trainee nurses exposed to performances of the show and/or its associated learning resources. Linked is the impact on pedagogy more broadly, with 15 higher education institutions \(HEIs\) and 1 NHS hospital committing to integrate TC’s findings into their training in the form of performances, practical classes or uptake of remote resources. There is also a developing impact at a national arts and healthcare education policy level with early signs of buy\-in from several key stakeholders. 

###  Impact on Trainees/Professionals: ‘Sometimes nursing is like theatre’ \(student quoted in \[E1\]\) 

 To date, TC research findings have been rendered into later iterations of *Careful* \[R1\], 3 practical classes for KU students \(one for each year of study\) and a pair of interactive digital workpacks \[R5\] created in response to the move to online learning due to Covid\-19. 

 Over 600 nursing students at KU have participated in the classes, with one cohort of 200 students having participated in a class in each year of their degree programme. Participants reported enhanced awareness of the embodied, interpersonal and affective dimensions of their role, and increased confidence about managing both their own and their patients’ emotions \[E1\]. The learning from these classes has had a lasting effect on participants’ clinical practice. According to an article in the Nursing Standard: ‘ *around 90% of those taking part think the workshops will have a positive effect on their practice, while around 85% said they had drawn on the learning during their next placement*’ \[E2\]. Likewise, reports suggested ‘ *In each* \[class\] *a potential impact of awareness or implementation was recorded for at least 90% of participants*’ \[E1\]. As one student reported, the classes also help to bridge the gap between theory and practice: “ *I really understand what I am writing about communication in my essay instead of just reading about it*” \[E1\]. 

 Trainee and established professionals report changes of perspective about their professional practice as a result of viewing *Careful*, the live performances of which have been seen by 600 trainees in addition to over 1,200 views of the recording. A trainee reflects, ‘ *there were elements of dance in the performance, which is obviously physically demanding.* \[…\] *It made me realise that, as nurses, we are also on our feet for 12 hours. Our priority is to meet everyone else’s physical needs but we don’t have that empathy towards ourselves. It felt like a reality check’* \[E2\]. Even very experienced nurses have found that TC’s findings have changed their perspectives: ‘ *one of the reasons I stopped being involved with nursing is because I’ve been trying to talk about these things* \[the findings of Mermikides’ research\] *for years and nobody cared.* \[…\] *There’s something here, in* \[Mermikides’\] *work, that allows us to reinterrogate what we fail to do for* \[…\] *people who have decided to lend us their heart* \[i.e. nurses\] \[…\] *and that somehow we still collectively and culturally abandon’* \[E3\]. 

 An estimated 1,300 students at 9 UK and European institutions have received digital workpacks created in response to the Covid\-19 pandemic. Initially developed for KU, where 600 trainees have engaged with them, 3 other HEIs subsequently requested access to the packs. On the basis of this interest, they were offered to and taken up by another 5 HEIs, 2 of which appointed Mermikides to lead online classes centred on the packs as a result. The first workpack ensured that findings from *Careful* \(sensitising students to the ways their embodiment can affect patients’ feelings\) can be delivered through remote learning. The second adapts strategies used by performers to cope with the demands of performance to help students who entered practice earlier than anticipated due to Covid\-19 handle stress. 

###  Impact on Nursing Curricula: ‘A hugely significant contribution to nursing pedagogy’ \[E4\] 

 Mermikides’ research, and the sustained collaboration it involved with two nursing lecturers at KU, has led to the expansion of the Adult Nursing degree programme to include TC workshops as core curriculum in all year groups. This is especially significant given the ‘crowded’ and highly\-regulated nature of the nursing curriculum. 

 The utility of Mermikides’ research for nursing pedagogy has also been recognised by other HEIs; 11 Heads of Department committed to host performances of *Careful* together with post\-show discussions and staff development events in 2020. This includes Edinburgh Napier University, which secured a Teaching Fellowship for Mermikides with a value of approximately GBP10,000 to enable more extensive consultation. The resulting tour of *Careful* was disrupted due to Covid\-19, but the firm commitment to these activities in itself signifies impact on the established practice of nursing education. Several of these institutions have sustained the relationship despite this disruption, through uptake of the digital workpacks. An example is the University of the West of England \(UWE\) where ‘ *the online resources* \[Mermikides\] *provided are being used in two nursing modules*’ \[E5\]. UWE also appointed Mermikides to run a webinar introducing TC performance\-based approaches to healthcare lecturers \(20 September 2020\). This attracted 40 participants from UWE and beyond, reflecting the fact that ‘ *discussions around the use of arts\-based approaches to teaching and learning in the Department of Nursing & Midwifery* \[at UWE\] *have increased since we have become aware of* \[Mermikides’\] *work’* \[E5\]. 

 Two of the most important nursing skills, as identified by Marie Curie \(2016\) and the Royal College of Nursing \(2016\), are sensitive and effective communication and emotional resilience. However, these are both difficult to teach and often squeezed out of a curriculum that prioritises medical knowledge. TC’s research processes and findings offer practical, research\-backed methods and insights, which have been ‘ *transformational to the teaching staff and nursing students it has involved*’ \[E2\]. TC has provided the nursing education sector with meaningful pedagogical tools that can support the development of overlooked skills. TC also offers a model for how collaborations across the arts and humanities and healthcare might develop to deliver similar outcomes in other areas. 

###  Impact on Arts and Health Policy: ‘This work has advanced thinking’ \[E6\] 

 In March 2020 Mermikides convened a virtual symposium, ‘Performance for Care’ \( [www.performanceforcare.com](http://www.performanceforcare.com/)\), in partnership with King’s College London and The King’s Fund, designed to pursue the policy implications of the TC project. This attracted over 400 healthcare educators and arts and health practitioners and policymakers internationally. The President of the Royal College of Nursing wrote that ‘ *the Performance for Care event revealed the need for more systematic survey of how performance is being used in nursing education across the UK’* \[E7\]. As a result of the symposium, the Deputy Head of Research and Evaluation at Public Health Wales set up the Performance and Care Working Group, ‘ *developing a new national group that is bringing together people working across nursing, performance and the arts to start doing a lot more work in that area* \[…\] *. ‘Dr Mermikides has been the group’s anchor in terms of its theoretical and philosophical underpinnings’* \[E4\]. Mermikides was invited to be a core member of this UK\-wide group and to give a keynote presentation at its inaugural event ‘Performing for Real’ in November 2020. 

 Performance for Care also alerted the UK’s All\-Party Parliamentary Group \(APPG\) for Arts, Health and Wellbeing to the ‘ *considerable*’ policy implications of TC \[E6\]. As a result, Mermikides had several meetings with an APPG representative, which served to inform and re\-prioritise their strategy to address recommendation 8 of their Creative Health report 2017 \(‘that the education of clinicians, public health specialists and other health and care professionals includes accredited modules on the evidence base and practical use of the arts for health and wellbeing’\). For them, ‘ *Mermikides’ research is helping to shape the conversation about how the arts can enhance interpersonal skills within the healthcare workforce, thereby improving patient satisfaction and, in some cases, health outcome*s’ \[E6\]. Mermikides was invited to present the TC project at a roundtable event on the theme of care in November 2020. 

 One of TC’s biggest successes is its evaluative underpinnings, which prove the efficacy of physical theatre as an educational tool. As noted by the APPG, ‘\[t\] *here is a significant evidence gap around the arts’ role in health and wellbeing, specifically for nursing education.* \[…\] *Mermikides’ work is helping to fill that gap’* \[E6\]. The evidence base built in to TC’s research design has also been praised by Public Health Wales: ‘\[p\] *roving that it works as a contribution to* \[these\] *pedagogical challenge*\[s\] *for nursing studies has been core’* \[E4\]. 

 The impact on the ‘arts in healthcare’ sector through changed perception and reception of such initiatives is further underscored by Clod Ensemble, a pioneer of arts\-based medical education that has engaged with Mermikides’ research since 2014. They write that: ‘ *by showing how the practice is underpinned by theory from applied arts and performance studies, Dr Mermikides’ work has helped to make the case for the growth of practical interventions of these kinds.* \[…\] *Mermikides’ research has profoundly influenced the sector within which our work exists’* \[E8\]. 

###  The cherry on top: ‘Elevating nursing’ \[E9\] 

 The necessity and power of TC’s tools of representation is significant not just for increasing staff retention and enabling more ‘care\-ful’ clinical encounters, but for morale and professional integrity; as one student nurse audience member of *Careful* \(who also participated in research workshops and is now in practice\) reflected in The Guardian, ‘ *elevating nursing to the level of art gave me another reason to be proud of the choice I have made to become one*’ \[E9\].

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The first wave of the COVID\-19 pandemic in the UK highlighted the vulnerability of care home residents and staff to the virus. Research led by Dr Laura Shallcross at the UCL Institute of Health Informatics provided critical insights into care home practices associated with infection and outbreaks. This work then informed key policy decisions regarding the care home sector: the prioritisation of limited testing capacity to focus on staff rather than residents; limiting of movement of agency staff between care homes; and provision of an infection control fund to enable staff to self\-isolate when unwell. Data gathered from this research were also combined into a single interactive dashboard which continues to function as the main UK care home data tool, informing all levels of government from local authorities to 10 Downing Street. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Research led by Dr Laura Shallcross at UCL has addressed a key challenge faced by care homes in the UK: that they lack routine surveillance of outbreaks and infections that might enable preventative measures to be taken. Since 2017, Shallcross has co\-directed the GBP2m, ESRC\-funded ‘Preserving Antibiotics through Safe Stewardship \(PASS\)’ research programme and led its data science work package. This project is a collaboration between Shallcross and colleagues across UCL; primary and secondary health providers; social researchers at the University of Leicester; designers at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Inclusive Design; and one of the UK’s largest care home chains, Four Seasons Healthcare. Its aim is to design antibiotic stewardship interventions that are tailored to specific healthcare settings to counteract the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance \(AMR\) caused by the over\-use of antibiotics. Findings have so far included the identification of the most impactful interventions around behaviour and organisational change in antimicrobial stewardship in care homes \(a systematic review, **\[R1\]**\) and mapping the frequency, patterns and risk factors of antibiotic prescribing for elderly residents via a large dataset derived from the partner care home chain **\[R2\]**. Shallcross led the data science and research design and analysis underpinning these publications, addressing the lack of routine surveillance of care homes in the UK via a retrospective analysis of the administrative records of this large care home chain. Shallcross’ work on PASS has given her unparalleled knowledge of the data available on prescribing, infection and outcomes among elderly residents via care home administrative records, and experience of working with care sector providers to access this data in an efficient and ethically sound way. As a consequence of this research, at the outbreak of the COVID\-19 crisis, Shallcross and the PASS project had access to the only large\-scale, individual\-level infection transmission and control dataset in UK care homes. 

 In March 2020, Shallcross was awarded GBP200,000 from UKRI to undertake a mixed methods study to investigate SARS\-CoV\-2 infection and mortality in care homes using data from Four Seasons Healthcare and qualitative interviews with staff. This project was called ‘COVID\-19: Burden and Impact in Care Homes \(CATCH\-19\)’. Shallcross tracked active infection, hospitalisation and mortality rates among the elderly residents of 179 Four Seasons Healthcare long\-term care facilities between March and June 2020 to identify factors associated with infection transmission and mortality. The emerging findings from this study showed that lower staffing rates and higher occupancy were the main risk factors in infection, and that actual infection rates of elderly residents within these sites was considerably higher than Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) assumptions at the time. The study also highlighted the high mortality rate in people who were not tested for COVID\-19, indicating the urgent need for a rigorous mass testing strategy in residential care settings **\[R3\]**. 

 Shallcross’ work on CATCH\-19 and PASS led to her being approached by Public Health England \(PHE\)/DHSC in Spring 2020 to lead a surveillance study in care homes that investigated COVID\-19 infection, immunity and its duration in English care homes. The VIVALDI\-1 study focused on care homes in England that mainly provided dementia care, or care to residents aged >65 years. There were two main objectives: to estimate the proportion of staff and residents who had been infected with COVID\-19 since the start of the pandemic; and to identify risk factors for infection and outbreaks in care homes. 

 Between 26 May and 19 June 2020, 95% of all care home managers were contacted by researchers from Ipsos MORI, and 56% \(5126/9081\) agreed to participate, with 160,033 residents and 248,594 staff becoming involved. The estimated proportion of residents and staff who reported being infected between 1st March and June 19th was 10.5% \(95% CI: 9.9\-11.1%\) and 3.8% \(95%: 3.4\-4.2%\) respectively. A total of 2,724 \(53.1%\) care homes had at least one case \[ **R4**\]. 

 The likelihood of infection and/or outbreaks was reduced in facilities that paid sickness pay, that had cohorted staff \(i.e. where staff caring for infected residents did not care for other residents\), that did not employ agency staff, and which had higher staff to resident ratios. The likelihood of infection and outbreaks was increased in facilities with higher numbers of admissions, poor compliance with isolation, ‘for profit’ status, and lower frequency of cleaning in communal areas. 

 The most significant implications of these findings were: 

-  Half of the care facilities surveyed had no known cases and therefore remained very vulnerable to outbreaks. 

-  Reducing transmission from staff required: a\) provision of financial support to the workforce to incentivise testing and self\-isolation when sick; and b\) investment to reduce reliance on agency staff and to increase staff to bed ratios. 

-  Available evidence supported the use of disease control measures such as cohorting and isolation. 

 Transmission from residents was associated with the number of admissions to the facility, highlighting the need to test and isolate new and returning residents **\[R5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There are approximately 410,000 older people \(>65\) resident in UK care homes, all of whom are significantly vulnerable due to mental and/ or physical ill\-health. They are cared for by a residential adult care sector that is diverse and complex: there are 11,300 care homes for the elderly alone, 95% of which are independent providers and 80% of which operate only one site. 

 Initial UK Government COVID\-19 guidance for the adult care sector stated that no special measures need be taken, and that *“it is very unlikely that anyone in a care home will be infected”* **\[S1\].** By the beginning of April 2020, modelling from the University of Manchester and DHSC based on early care home COVID\-19 infections showed this assumption to likely be unsound: a prevalence of 75% was projected if policy remained unchanged. On the basis of her earlier research, Shallcross was asked in early May 2020 to work with NHS England, the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) and DHSC to set up the VIVALDI\-1 study and provide a robust evidence base with which to plan a response to protect this large, varied and highly vulnerable care sector and its residents. Shallcross’ research was initiated explicitly to supply the critical epidemiological data needed to identify the likely most effective policy measures for protecting care home residents and staff \[ **S2**\]. 

 Shallcross presented the study’s findings **\[R4\], \[R5\]** and their implications to the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\) Social Care working group in June 2020. These findings were provided directly to senior UK decision makers in the Department of Health and Social Care, SAGE, and 10 Downing Street, thus delivering crucial insights into the risk factors driving the first wave of the pandemic. The Chair of the UK Government Social Care Sector COVID\-19 Support Taskforce writes in a letter that: “ *this research influenced my views on how to protect care home staff and residents from COVID\-19. The research findings informed recommendations that were published in the Social Care Sector Taskforce’s report, and subsequently largely accepted by Government and translated into practice through the Adult Social Care COVID\-19 Winter Plan.*” \[ **S2**\] 

 Referring to the early policy influence of VIVALDI\-1, UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance wrote in a testimonial letter to the Provost of UCL: *“This work informed key policy decisions in June/July 2020 regarding the frequency of care home testing, and strategies to reduce the spread of infection as detailed below:* 

 *• **Whether limited testing capacity should be used for staff or residents, and which care homes to prioritise for testing.** VIVALDI\-1 showed that per capita people in small care homes were equally as vulnerable \[as those in large ones\] and this changed the proposed testing strategy so that all care homes were tested, not just large care homes, as testing capacity increased.* 

 *• **Limiting movement of staff between care homes.** VIVALDI\-1 \[…\] results had a major impact on policy decisions/discussions with the care sector about how to ensure sufficient staffing ratios whilst limiting the number of staff who work across multiple sites.* 

 *• **Payment of staff sickness pay to ensure that staff could self\-isolate when unwell.** Findings from VIVALDI\-1 supported the decision to establish the Infection Control Fund \(ICF\)… This has led to a substantial increase in the proportion of care homes that report paying sickness pay to their staff.”* **\[S3\]** 

 **Implementing the recommendations of the VIVALDI\-1 report: impacts of testing, staffing and sick pay in the adult residential care sector.** 

 **Testing strategy in care homes:** Shallcross’ research directly informed the current approach of mass weekly testing for all staff in all homes \(currently hundreds of thousands of tests a week\). Each of the \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] positive tests between 29 June and 31 December 2021 among care home staff and residents represented a case that could have led to a dangerous outbreak in at least one residential care setting, in every instance infecting many of the UK’s most vulnerable people, placing extra burden on healthcare systems and potentially resulting in deaths, as shown in UK national COVID\-19 Pillar 1 and 2 test results **\[S4\].** 

 **Take up of Infection Control Fund \(ICF\) support for the residential care sector and workforce:** The ICF is a GBP6m fund to support adult social care providers, to reduce transmission within the sector and increase workforce resilience **\[S5\]**. The ICF was targeted at two of the VIVALDI\-1 recommendations to minimise COVID\-19 transmission in residential adult care: that movement of care workers between sites should cease, and that worker sick pay should be topped up by government. It was deployed in two tranches: the first \(of GBP300m\) ran until 23 July 2020, and the second half of the funding was released on 24 July 2020. In the period to 23 July 2020, GBP257,601,441 had been allocated by English local authorities to 14,156 residential care providers, and of that figure 24.7% \(across 8,411 providers\) had been spent on limiting worker movement between sites. A further 18.72% \(across 7,898 providers\) had been used to pay staff full wages following a positive COVID\-19 test **\[S6\]**. As noted by several of the corroborating sources here, without Shallcross’ research and the VIVALDI\-1 project neither of these factors in COVID\-19 transmission in care homes would have been identified and prioritised, and the scale of the problem \(as evidenced by the majority of care providers making use of the ICF for these purposes\) would not have been apparent. On 18 September 2020, the UK Government published the ‘Adult Social Coronavirus Winter Care Plan 2020\-2021’, in which the ICF was extended until March 2021, with an extra GBP546m available **\[S1\].** 

 **Ongoing impacts of VIVALDI\-1 on DHSC’s response to COVID\-19** 

 In addition to providing an evidence base for key policy decisions, the VIVALDI\-1 study also contributed improved data\-gathering and reporting mechanisms around COVID\-19 testing in care homes. VIVALDI\-1 linked information derived from care homes to the UK national COVID\-19 testing Pillar 2 results that were being collected through the national care home testing programme. Shallcross and her colleagues were the only team who were accessing and analysing Pillar 2 data in this way. In mid\-2020, Shallcross realised the potential of this data, which could be used to monitor SARS\-CoV\-2 prevalence in care home staff and residents by region and over time. She started producing short reports based on the dashboard for DSHC. These reports were presented to the DHSC Adult Social Care team and to Ministers via the Data Debrief Group, chaired by the DHSC Director of COVID\-19 Response. The interactive dashboard was being used up to the end of the REF 2021 period and beyond by DHSC to monitor the burden of infection in care homes, explore factors associated with outbreaks and mortality, and is shared with local directors of public health. The Director of the Adult Social Care Team at DHSC states: \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] **\[S7\].** 

 The insights into COVID\-19 infection in care homes have also directly informed vaccination policy and shaped the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation in December 2020 to prioritise the vaccination of care home residents and residential care home staff **\[S8\]**. In November 2020, the government further recognised the importance of the VIVALDI\-1 project by announcing plans to expand the study and provide an even more detailed picture of COVID\-19 infection in care homes **\[S9\]**. 

 The Director of Strategy for Private Testing, DHSC, concludes: *“As a direct result of \[Dr Shallcross’s\] findings, and thanks to intelligent and diplomatic pressure from \[her\], SAGE and DHSC changed their advice, and rolled out mass repeat weekly testing of staff across all care homes for the >65s in England. \[…\] Motivated by public service, \[Dr Shallcross\] showed real intellectual and moral bravery in her approach, and it is increasingly clear that her actions are likely to have contributed to saving many hundreds of lives.”* **\[S10\]** 

  

 The impact of the VIVALDI\-1 study – the speed with which it was established and its effectiveness in shaping and informing policy – has been recognised in its 2021 nomination for a Civil Service Award.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Accessibility and affordability of medicines is a global challenge. El Said’s research has had a significant impact by mapping the current global standards of intellectual property \(IP\) protection and by making recommendations about adopting strategies which resulted in creating IP regimes incorporating the necessary legal tools needed to improve access to medicines. As a result, policy debate \(internationally and nationally\) has been stimulated and informed by the research evidence, leading to policy decisions and changes to patent legislations, such as in the case of \[text removed for publication\] and \[text removed for publication\] patent laws. The research has impacted on the policy approaches of international organisations such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation \(WIPO\) and Unitaid and upon debates in several developing countries.  This has resulted in legislative change in individual jurisdictions, including \[text removed for publication\] and \[text removed for publication\].  It has informed current debate in other countries such as \[text removed for publication\] and \[text removed for publication\], where the research has been utilised to both advance a set of rationales for legal intervention and to promote legislative changes. These changes make medicines more affordable and accessible, which in turn improves the health of citizens.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Accessibility and affordability of medicines and new health technologies has attracted considerable attention from governments, international organisations, civil society groups, and specialised United Nations \(UN\) agencies. As such, accessibility and affordability of medicines is viewed as a global challenge. Statistics indicate that one third of the global population lacks reliable access to medicines. More than 13% of Americans, about 34 million people, say a friend or family member recently passed away in the last five years after being unable to afford treatment for a condition, according to a recent poll from Gallup and West Health. A recent study in the UK found that total NHS spending on medicines in England has grown from GBP13,000,000,000 in 2010/11 to GBP17,400,000,000 in 2016/17 – an average growth of around 5% a year. The situation is even worse in the poorest countries of Africa and Asia, where as much as 50% of the population lacks such access. While some 10 million lives a year could be saved by improving access to essential medicines and vaccines, 4 million in Africa and South\-East Asia alone, a major obstacle to achieving this has been the price. In 2016, the United Nations Secretary\-General’s High\-Level Panel on Access to Medicines highlighted the negative impact arising from strengthened levels of IP on access to medicines and medical health technologies. The current global outbreak of the COVID\-19 pandemic has also raised considerable challenges at the global level, giving El Said’s work higher recognition and relevance. El Said’s research addresses these issues within the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \(SDG\) with a focus on SDG3, Good Health and Well Being and SDG10, Reduced Inequalities. 

 Research undertaken by El Said has informed research, policy makers and international agencies on the relationship between IP and patent laws and access to medicines through focusing on raising awareness and proposing solutions to improve access to medicines nationally, regionally and globally \[3\]. In 2010, El Said solely authored a policy guide for the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) on the impact of IP and free trade agreements on access to medicines. This was the first publication of its type in the Eastern Mediterranean Regional office of the WHO \(EMRO\) targeting policy makers and government officials \[5\].  El Said was also the legal lead for the REWARD project \(2014\-2019\) which is funded by the European Research Council \(ERC\). The objective of REWARD was to create an ethically and legally sound performance\-based reward tool for pharmaceutical innovation, which complements the existing patent regime, yet mitigates its considerable disadvantages for the global poor \[2\]. 

 El Said has been the sole author of publications and policy documents for the WHO \[5\] and co\-author of United Nations Development Programme publications \(UNDP\) \[6\] in both English and Arabic languages. The research was initiated in 2005. There has been continuing international impact with important developments within the current REF period, impacting on legislatures, policy makers, international organisations, civil society groups and researchers in countries where reform of the patent regime has taken place or is being considered. The global COVID\-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of access to medicines. El Said’s research has become increasingly relevant as Lower Middle\-Income Countries \(LMIC\) struggle to deal with the impacts of the pandemic \[1\]. 

 El Said’s involvement in international high\-level policy research with international organisations has contributed to international debate.  He has advised policy makers in several countries on the reform of their patent legislation, with the aim of improving access to medicines and public health. 

 Since the publication of the Policy Guide by WHO in 2010 \[5\], El Said continued to be actively involved in the global debate on IP and access to medicines. In 2011 he co\-authored \(with one other international expert\) a working paper on the role of IP Law and Policy on Access to Medicines for the Global Commission on HIV and the Law which was published by the United Nations Development Programme \(UNDP\) \[4\]. El Said’s contribution in the working paper was significant in terms of analysing current global IP norms and in making recommendations about reforming the global IP regime \[A\]. 

 Since 2010, El Said has been approached by a number of leading global organisations to share his research insights on policy approaches and agendas. For example, El Said’s research **‘contributed to setting the ground for the implementation work that has been undertaken’** by the World Intellectual Property Organisation \(WIPO\) \[G\]. El Said’s research was sought by Unitaid \(of which the UK is a founding member\). Unitaid is a global health initiative that works with partners to develop innovation in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of major diseases in LMICs. The initiative states the importance of El Said’s contributions as: **‘’his inputs and suggestions have helped shape Unitaid’s approach to intellectual property rights and access to medicines’’** \[H\]. In addition, the work of El Said has been recognised by other organisations such as the South Centre, an intergovernmental organisation of developing nations that undertakes research and analysis on various international policy areas which are considered key to the protection and promotion of the interests of developing countries. The South Centre recognised El Said’s research as: **‘‘useful for policy makers to address those issues at the national and regional level, notably with relation to process of reform of patent laws’’** \[I\]. 

 In January 2017, El Said was invited by the UNDP to edit the Arabic language version of the UN High\-Panel Report \[J\]. The impact of the translation for the Arabic speaking countries is vital in assisting these countries in keeping up with international developments and in taking a more active role in policy debates nationally and internationally. As stated by UNDP: **‘‘the significance of the report’s availability for the Arabic speaking countries was highlighted to us through the positive feedback we continue to receive from officials in these”** \[J\]. 

 El Said’s research has led to national training, policy decisions, proposals and amendments to legislations in \[text removed for publication\]. It has been used to advance a set of rationales for legal intervention and legislative reform through national workshops with policy makers and led to policy recommendations. This has already led to legislative reform in \[text removed for publication\] and \[text removed for publication\] \[I, J\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 El Said’s legal research and policy publications have stimulated and informed national policy and public debate in several countries. Moreover, El Said’s research was adopted by international agencies and organisations in addition to making a significant contribution to national and international policy debate. This has led to policy decisions and changes and amendments to legislation in individual jurisdictions in the field of IP and access to medicines. El Said’s research has contributed to raising awareness, stimulating national and international debate on the issue of access to medicines \[G, H, I, J\] and prompted legislative reform \[I, J\].  It has also facilitated the uptake of tools that drive innovation \[G, H\]. 

 <ins> **Stimulating and informing international and national policy debates**</ins> <ins>*</ins> 

 El Said’s 2010 policy guide for the WHO \[5\] was the first ever publication of its type directed to the EMRO region. WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region comprises 21 Member States and Palestine \(West Bank and Gaza Strip\), with a population of nearly 583 million people. It presently remains the leading document for policy makers and stakeholders concerned with public health and access to medicines in the region. The document was distributed officially to all concerned member states and has been widely cited beyond the region. 

  

 The final report of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law referenced and cited El Said’s co\-authored publication \[A, 6\]. The Global Commission is an independent body convened by the United Nations Development Programme to interrogate the relationships between legal responses, human rights and HIV. The UN High\-Level Panel Report aims to address the role of intellectual property law and policy in access to medicines. In November 2015, the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki\-Moon, convened the High\-Level Panel on Access to Medicines with the aim “to review and assess proposals and recommend solutions for remedying the policy incoherence between the justifiable rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules and public health in the context of health technologies”. El Said acted, in February 2016, as an adviser to a member of the High\-Level Panel on Access to Medicines \(H.E Awn Al Khasawneh, an ex\-prime minister of Jordan and former Judge at the International Court of Justice ‘ICJ’\) and was invited to participate at the High\-Level Panel’s hearing which was held in London in March 2016 \[J\]. The published UN High\-Level Panel Report \[B\] included reference to and citations of El Said’s published work, which highlights the development of the global IP regime in recent years by referencing the case of Jordan which El Said had extensively examined. The UN High\-Level Panel Report is in many ways a milestone achievement since it calls upon governments, international organizations, the private sector, the science community, research institutions and civil society to adopt new approaches to the way in which innovation and access are addressed within and beyond the intellectual property protection regime. In addition, in January 2017, El Said was requested by the UNDP to edit the Arabic language version of the UN High\-Level Panel Report \[J\]. 

 Since 2010, El Said has been approached by a number of leading global organisations to share his research insights on policy approaches and agendas. For example, El Said’s research contributed to **‘setting the ground for the implementation work’** that has been undertaken by the World Intellectual Property Organisation \(WIPO\) \[G\]. Since 2017, El Said’s research was sought by Unitaid, in formulating and drafting its IP policy on access to medicines \[H\]. El Said’s research was also recognised by the South Centre to be **‘useful for policy makers to address those issues at the national and regional level, notably with relation to process of reform of patent laws’** \[I\]. 

 At the national level, El Said has also been involved in providing national training workshops for policy makers in \[text removed for publication\] at the request of the UNDP on the protection of IP and the internet in April 2020. The training is part of the country’s IP implementation strategy. Beneficiaries include the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court, the Academy of Justice; the General Prosecutor Office, the High Judicial Council and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 

 El Said’s research has also been widely cited in many official documents and policy publications by leading UN and other global organisations such as WIPO, WHO, WTO, UNDP, UNAIDS & the South Centre \[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J\]. 

  

 <ins> **Improving public health in LMICs through legislative change**</ins> <ins>*</ins> 

 El Said’s research has had an impact on national legal debates within \[text removed for publication\] and \[text removed for publication\] \[I,J\]. El Said was invited to a series of national stakeholder meetings and seminars organised by official authorities and international organisations \(such as WHO, WIPO, UNDP, Unitaid, the South Centre, Max Plank Institute for Competition\) \[G, H, I, J\] to share the findings of his research. These meetings included representatives of civil society, patient groups, parliamentarians; policy makers, lawyers, academics, and researchers. More importantly, El Said provided technical reports and legal analysis and advice for patent law reform for several countries \(including \[text removed for publication\]\) \[I, J\]. The objective of amending these legislations was to incorporate greater flexibilities into the IP and patent regimes. There is recognition from both \[text removed for publication\] and \[text removed for publication\] of the impacts of El Said’s research on the legislative change of the patent laws \[I, J\]. The implementation of these provisions enables the introduction and supply of cheaper medicines to the domestic market and contributes substantially to improving the public health of the population. 

 El Said’s research has led to legislative change and this represents an important milestone in improving access to medicines. This has resulted in an increase in the number of patients having access to medicines and on public providers’ ability to cater for the needs for more patients. The stakeholders benefiting from the impact are multiple including patients, NGOs, public health providers, practitioners, academics and politicians.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research by Murphy and Carlin at Ulster University has had wide\-reaching influence in setting public health guidelines for physical activity in the UK and worldwide. The contributing research into the health effects of brisk walking, directly led the UK government to develop a mobile app, Active 10, to encourage inactive people to exercise more. Based on research conducted at Ulster, Murphy led an expert group tasked with reviewing evidence for the benefits of activity in adults. The results of the review were then used to update the UK’s public health guidelines for physical activity \(2019\) and in the UK’s COVID\-19 messaging and communication. Ulster’s research has also been used as evidence in the setting of international physical activity guidelines in the USA and the Netherlands. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Physical inactivity is a leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality, and is the target of many public health interventions. The starting point for such interventions is an understanding of the duration, frequency and type of exercise required to improve health, and the development and dissemination of evidence\-based physical activity guidelines. 

 Research conducted at Ulster by Murphy and Carlin revolves around the duration, frequency and type of exercise required to improve health. It has played a major part in informing public health physical activity guidelines worldwide, and has shaped interventions designed to increase population level physical activity. 

 This internationally recognised body of research into the health effects of walking incorporates investigations of the effects of differing lengths of time and intensities on health outcomes. Crucial for the impact of this research are studies into what constitutes sufficient activity to provide a health benefit, and how best to communicate that activity. 

 In 2002 the team at Ulster investigated how the term “brisk walking” was interpreted by individuals. The research showed that instructing someone to walk briskly actually resulted in an intensity of effort which would bring health and fitness benefit **\(R1\)**. 

 Subsequent research considered the utility of a number of short bouts of exercise rather than a single extended session. The findings showed no difference in health or fitness outcomes between those exercising in a number of shorter bouts, compared with exercising 

 in a single longer session **\(R2\).** Murphy and colleagues revisited this theme in 2009 and again in 2019 with a systematic review and meta\-analysis of all studies into the effects derived from continued versus accumulated bouts of exercise. In most cases, a health benefit was observed irrespective of the exercise pattern; this was an important finding in terms of offering advice to inactive people and setting physical activity guidelines for public health **\(R3, R4\).** 

 The physical activity research team at Ulster also investigated the importance of the intensity and regularity of walking in contrast to the practice of counting daily steps \(which has no implied intensity\), to consider the differing health benefits of gentle walking versus walking at a brisk pace. This research has highlighted that even self\-paced exercise perceived as ‘moderate’, such as brisk walking, can have significant health benefits in sedentary individuals, including lowering blood pressure and keeping weight stable **\(R5\).** 

 More recently, after being tasked by the UK’s four Chief Medical Officers \(CMOs\) to advise on and prepare guidelines for health practitioners and members of the public, Murphy, Carlin and colleagues from the UK and Europe undertook a systematic meta\-analytic review looking more closely into the benefits of accumulated versus continuous exercise **\(R4\).** They concluded that for adults, the health benefits \(fitness, blood pressure, lipids, insulin and glucose\) were the same whether their exercise was done continuously or accumulated over several sessions; indeed for weight loss, splitting an exercise session into several short bouts across a day may provide extra benefits. These findings bolster the argument for advising the public to take short, frequent exercise sessions. 

 Finally, a 2015 meta\-analysis undertaken by Murphy and updated in 2018 \( **R6\)** looked more deeply into the question of whether walking is a useful intervention for improving health. These studies collectively showed that regular walking improved cardiovascular health, underscoring the importance of walking as a cornerstone intervention in public health.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The health benefits derived from physical activity impact not only the individual, but also wider society and the economy. Evidence shows that regular physical activity reduces risk of, and can help manage approximately 20 non\-communicable diseases or conditions, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity, breast and colon cancer, and hypertension. In addition, physical activity contributes to improved mental health, increasing mood, wellbeing and quality of life, reducing depression, and preventing cognitive decline including dementia. Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. It is estimated to be responsible for 16.6% of all deaths in the UK, and costs the NHS GBP0.9bn per year. 

  

 Ulster’s research into the differing types of exercise, their duration and distribution, and contributions to health has directly influenced the guidelines for public health in the UK, USA and Netherlands **\(C1, C10, R2, R4, R6\).** The research has also been used to develop successful government\-led initiatives for encouraging people to be more active **\(C3\).** 

 <ins> **Impact on UK and International Physical Activity Guidelines, and Development of Active 10 App for Health Professionals:**</ins> 

 Murphy was a lead author of the 2011 UK Physical Activity Guidelines, *Start Active, Stay Active*, which was commissioned by the CMOs of the UK’s four constituent countries. In 2018\-19, Murphy led the review of evidence for the updated guidelines and was the lead author for the guidelines for adults **\(C1\).** As stated by the CMO for Northern Ireland, “ *Our understanding of the relationship between physical activity and health has grown significantly over the last ten years. This is down to academics and researchers like you generating and translating the evidence into policy advice and guidelines that inform the people we serve, health professionals and policy makers.”* **\(C4 **\)** 

 For the purpose of developing health guidelines for the chronically inactive, walking has been identified as one of the most likely modalities to be taken up and maintained over the course of life. The CMO commissioned Murphy to be part of a small team to consider how to encourage inactive people to meet the physical activity guidelines. Murphy was tasked to gather evidence in a review, to determine what health benefits came from brisk walking for just 10 minutes **\(C2\).** From this rapid review, which included research from Murphy, Public Health England developed the Active 10 app, available to anyone free of charge and launched in September 2017. 

 Active 10 encourages people to undertake at least 10 minutes of brisk walking per day, in addition to any other activity they were routinely doing. The expectation was that once 10 minutes of brisk walking was achieved, those individuals would then continue for longer periods, and more frequently. Consequently more individuals would meet the activity levels set out in the UK guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activity per week. Free to download on the UK’s National Health Service website, Active 10 allows users to track their walking over a week or longer, and to interact with other users. The app provides encouragement in the form of motivational messages and online forums **\(C3\).** 

 Since its launch, the Active 10 app has been downloaded approximately <ins> **1 million</ins>** times **\(C5\)**. The initial success of the app led to a newer version being developed and launched in September 2019. Independent evidence has shown a cohort of approximately 129,000 users who used the app for over 8 weeks had a 10\-fold increase in their brisk walking, with 54% of the most inactive \(showing virtually no brisk walking activity in week 1\) achieving the guideline of 10 minutes of walking per day within 8 weeks **\(C5\).** 

 Murphy’s research also fed into a range of infographics developed for health professionals in 2016. The infographics allow health practitioners to communicate effectively the benefits of even short bursts of activity. The message “ *sit less move more*” underlines the advice. The infographics offer different advice for differing demographics. Murphy’s specific involvement was in developing the advice for adults and children, but other advice for pregnant women and disabled people was also depicted **\(C6\).** 

 Following this work on the infographics and Active 10 app, the UK CMOs asked Murphy to help review the evidence for, and to update, the 2011 guidelines **\(C4\).** The team responsible for recommending activity levels for adults was chaired by Murphy, and those recommendations included Murphy and Carlin’s 2019 meta\-analytic review into the health effects of continuous versus accumulated exercise **\(C1, R4\).** Moreover, Murphy’s specific research contribution to this series of public health interventions on physical activity was characterised by the CMO for Northern Ireland as constituting “ *a very significant contribution at a national level.”* **\(C4\)** 

 Murphy has contributed to informing physical activity policy in Northern Ireland. Aligned to a collaboration between the policy think tank Pivotal and Ulster **\(C7\)**, where Murphy carried out a policy audit on physical activity in Northern Ireland government policy, Murphy has been co\-opted on to the Department for Communities Strategic Board tasked with developing a 2021\-2030 Northern Ireland Physical Activity and Sport Strategy **\(C8\).** 

 In January 2020, Murphy participated in an episode of the BBC’s *Trust Me I’m a Doctor* \(Series 9, episode 1\) *,* which conducted an experiment to compare 10,000 steps per day versus brisk walking to the beat of music. In the show, all volunteers displayed health benefits, but the ones who did brisk walking, rather than step\-counting, lost more body fat **\(C9\).** The programme was watched approximately <ins> **1 million**</ins> times **\(C9\).** 

 Reaching beyond the UK **\(R4\),** Murphy’s research has also been cited in US \(2018\) and Dutch \(2017\) physical activity guidelines \( **R2, R6, C10\).** Collectively, and through each set of international guidelines, Murphy’s work helped to emphasise the importance of accumulated physical activity to health and disease prevention, aligned to setting national public health policy via recommendations for physical activity in individuals across all ages \(children, young people and adults\) and abilities. The public health impact of achieving physical activity guidelines is substantial, ranging from reduced risk of death and reduced risk of common and costly diseases \(such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes\) to a more general improved physical function and enhanced quality of life **\(C10\).** 

 <ins> **Impact of Physical Activity on COVID\-19 Health Messaging:**</ins> 

 In November 2020, as part of the CMOs Physical Activity Guidelines Expert Group for Communication, Murphy contributed to the wording for COVID\-19 related public health messaging to ensure a consistent approach across the four UK nations. This was a revised set of evidence\-based COVID\-19 physical activity messages for the UK CMOs to use as part of their briefings and communication with the media and public. An extract from the guidance provided to the Government reads as follows: “ **As things return to normal \-** The benefits of regular physical activity are for all ages and all stages of life \- **be as active as you can as often as you can**. <ins>Avoid</ins> mentioning the minimum threshold of 150 minutes each week of moderate activity … Note 5: Experimental evidence… suggest that adults are likely to accrue similar health benefits from exercising in a single bout or accumulating activity from shorter bouts throughout the day.”* **\(R4, C11\)**

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 This case study reflects on engagement in academic, political, public and policy debate, around homelessness and in particular how the housing needs of those involved in the criminal justice system are addressed.  The underpinning aims of the research focus has been to highlight the experiences of those who find themselves homeless/homeless and involved in the justice system, explore how needs are met within current systems; contribute to the debate regarding the social costs of homelessness; stimulate debate on how needs associated with homelessness  are currently, and might in future be better,  addressed. The impact has been in relation to Welsh Government policy and practice in relation to addressing homelessness especially, but not exclusively, as it relates to prison leavers. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The case study draws on a long standing interest in issues of homelessness within the team, given form initially as a result of Hughes’s research into homelessness in Wrexham. Publications from this project  provided the platform in 2016 for Madoc\-Jones to collaborate with University of Salford in a Welsh Government funded Post\-implementation evaluation of Part 2 of the Housing Act \(Wales\) 2014 \(dealing with homelessness\) \( **reference 3.1**\).  Subsequently there was a successful team bid to Evaluate Homelessness Services to Adults leaving  the Secure Estate \(Wales\) \( **reference 3.2**\).  More recently, members of the team were part of a Cardiff University/Herriot\-Watt University led, Welsh Government funded review of Priority Need \(for housing\) in Wales \( **reference 3.3**\). 

 The underpinning research has largely been of a qualitative nature, involving co\-ordinating and conducting  large numbers of  interviews and focus groups with stakeholders \(service providers and potential beneficiaries\) in the field of housing and homelessness across Wales. The research has often involved: engaging with hard to reach groups e.g. homeless people \( **reference 3.1**\) and  offenders inside and outside of prison establishments \( **reference 3.2**\); policy makers and practitioners in the field of housing and homelessness in Wales \( **references 3.2;3.3** \) and translating the findings into policy recommendations for Welsh Government ministers \( **references 3.1;3.2 and 3.3**\). 

 Key insights from our work relate to the experience of homelessness and the efficacy of social policy to address homelessness \(especially amongst prison leavers\) in the context of new ‘preventative’ duties having been placed on local authorities to address homelessness in Wales.  Key insights from our work relate to the experience of homelessness and the efficacy of social policy to address homelessness \(especially amongst prison leavers\) in the context of new ‘preventative’ duties having been placed on local authorities to address homelessness in Wales.  our research found a group of prison leavers were caught in a revolving door of serving short prison sentences followed by relatively brief periods in the community before they reoffend or are recalled and are imprisoned again. They presented as having multiple needs and likely to be difficult to house because they had a history of substance misuse, tenancy failures and exclusions.  The research found shortcomings in practice regarding housing advice on reception, pre\-release assessment of housing needs and the timing of housing referrals \(largely made in the last 2\-6 weeks before release, rather than 12 weeks before release as stipulated in the National Pathway, leaving insufficient time for responsible officers to provide risk assessment information and for local authority housing staff to engage with a prison leaver to help them find accommodation before they were released\).  In the time available they prioritised assessing eligibility for priority need as opposed to helping prison leavers to secure accommodation. In that regard, the eligibility bar for being assessed as vulnerable and potentially in priority need was too high. Key recommendations for specific stakeholders were made as outlined below. In our testimonials we provide information in relation to whether the recommendations as accepted and actioned. 

 The Welsh Government should: 

-  Continue to evaluate and promote implementation of the National Pathway. 

-  Review Prison Link Cymru delivery contracts to ensure they adequately reflect workload demands and contain contingencies in relation to staff absences. 

-  Remove ‘intentional homelessness’ as a disqualification criterion for housing. 

 The Ministry of Justice and Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service should: 

-  Review Community Rehabilitation Companies \(CRC\) contract compliance and how the needs of prison leavers are being managed under the Transforming Rehabilitation agenda. 

-  Ensure that housing referrals are completed only by professional staff. 

-  Review the inclusion criteria for Integrated Offender Management \(IOM\) to ensure ‘revolving door’ offenders, who move quickly into and out of prisons are provided with the most intensive and potentially most supportive access to services. 

-  Develop Approved Premises facilities for High Risk females. 

 The Wales CRC and NPS Wales should 

-  Develop auditing processes that include a timeliness and quality assessment of housing risk assessment \(Annex 9\) practices. 

-  Link with local women centres to ensure access to gender specific services that can contribute to addressing the complex and multiple needs that most female prison leavers have. 

-  Explore the advantages of having dedicated staff \(SPOC\) to work with prison leavers as per the ‘throughcare’ team model. 

 Local Authorities should: 

-  Develop individualised plans \(PHPs\) for all prison leavers which link them into meaningful housing options in the community prior to release. 

-  Review the thresholds and evidential requirements associated with conferring priority need status paying particular attention to the relevance of the harm attendant on repeat prison sentences. 

-  Train staff in principle of good offender motivation and engagement. 

 The research has been disseminated in reports published on the Welsh Government website \( **references 3.1;3.2;3.3**\). Madoc\-Jones has co\-edited a  themed section in the  Journal of Social Policy and Society\- an international academic journal sponsored by the UK Social Policy Association, which was devoted to the findings and implications of the team’s research into homelessness\) to the international audience of the journal \( **indicative reference 3.4**\); and, in total, ten separate articles focusing on homelessness and policy responses to this issue have been published by the research team  in peer reviewed national and international academic journals \( **exemplar reference 3.5**\). Members of the team were also invited to discuss their research about the housing experience of prison leavers’ when giving evidence to the Commission on Justice in Wales and Welsh Affairs Committee Inquiry into Prison Provision in Wales. Finally, results of our research into homelessness have been disseminated at a number of national and international academic, policy and practitioner led conferences to which the research team have been formally invited \( **indicative reference 3.6**\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 One aspect of the impact relates to increasing the profile of the issue of homelessness and the challenges of addressing it to a national and international practitioner and academic audience. Our work has been cited in national and international publications \( **references 1; 2**\) and has informed a number of subsequent reports and reviews of arrangements to address homelessness \( **reference 3**\). It has been used in local and regional training programmes \( **reference 4**\) and by the groups campaigning to end homelessness \( **reference 5**\) Media reporting can be influential in shaping the views and priorities of decision makers and members of the public. Our engagement with the media has therefore also had the potential to impact on how homelessness is perceived and addressed \( **reference 6**\). 

 In terms of the impact, the majority of our recommendations in our evaluation of “The National Pathway for Homelessness Services to Adults leaving the Secure Estate \(Wales\)” were accepted by the Welsh Government. In response to our report, three regional resettlement meetings were established in order to look to rebuild relationships between housing and criminal sector officers \( **references 7; 8**\).  Funding was then allocated to recruit a series of six co\-ordinators who work within the National Probation Service Local Delivery Units across Wales to address the barriers to implementation of the National Pathway indicated in our report. As of 01.06.19 – all officers were in place \( **references 7; 8**\). 

 As per our recommendations, the Welsh Government developed new systems for monitoring housing outcomes for prison leavers and have instigated a review of Prison Link Cymru delivery contracts to ensure they adequately reflect workload demands and contain contingencies in relation to staff absences. In the latter regard, additional funding was allocated to both the North and South projects to increase capacity in the project, which in turn, will help to overcome issues around implementation of the Pathway \( **reference 7**\). 

 In terms of wider impact, and as a result of our report, Welsh Government have jointly funded an Accommodation Officer who is working with the criminal justice sector to examine the practicalities of implementing the recommendations from our report which fall outside the powers of Welsh Government. Welsh Government have also recruited a secondee into the Homelessness Prevention team to focus and lead on this key issue \( **reference 8**\). 

 In terms of local authority recommendations, our report, alongside the larger report into Homelessness with colleagues at Salford, has provided evidence for a review of the Statutory Code of Guidance associated with the Housing \(Wales\) Act. \( **reference 7**\). 

 As a result of our work, there has been additional investment in activities to address homelessness from Welsh Government and Her Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service \(HMPPS\). The evaluation informed a number of pieces of work in HMPPS in Wales – one of these was the creation of the role of Senior Project Officer for prisoner resettlement\- who is leading on how the service implement the recommendations from the evaluation. Beneficiaries of this and the research will be Welsh Government ministers and staff in Government and HMPPS \(Probation/prison\) contexts with responsibility for policy development and implementation. Ultimately this feeds through in terms of an impact of service beneficiaries\- in this case, in particular, prison leavers \( **references 7;8**\). 

 The specific and wider impact of our research on Welsh Government and HMPPS policy was cited and reported in the Welsh Affairs committee report on prison provision in Wales, where it was stated HMPPS in Wales is working with partners to take the recommendations forward and ensure that those leaving custody are given the best opportunities to secure suitable housing on release. Reference is made to jointly funding a post with Welsh Government to drive this work forward, and to the fact HMPPS in Wales are also working closely with Welsh Government to develop and implement Housing First and Housing Led pilots in Wales, specifically targeting offenders leaving custody. \( **reference 9**\) 

 In the academic literature there  have been suggestions that governments worldwide could learn from the Welsh homelessness prevention model, with Mackie \(2015: 41\) proposing that it ‘might offer a replicable solution to the challenges of preventing homelessness across the rest of the developed world’. In that context, our research is likely to have international implications albeit the idiosyncrasies of the policy transfer and development process make that hard to quantify. 

 At present Madoc\-Jones is involved with colleagues at  Cardiff University; The Institute for Social Policy, Housing, Equalities Research \(I\-SPHERE\) at Heriot\-Watt University; The Centre for Homelessness Impact in London; along with a team of International Expert Advisors at York University \(Canada\); University of Ottawa \(Canada\); University of Chicago \(USA\); University of Girona \(Spain\); and The Danish National Centre for Social Research \(Denmark\) in drawing up an ESRC bid in relation to establishing a research centre to explore and  advance the UK evidence base to prevent and end homelessness.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 In March 2020 the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization \(WHO\). That same month, King’s researchers together with ZOE Global \(a King’s spinout\) rapidly adapted a successful King’s digital health App into the COVID Symptom Study App. This was used to capture real\-time data on known and potential symptoms of COVID\-19 from residents of the UK, USA and Sweden. Endorsed by the Welsh, English and Scottish Governments, over 4,000,000 people signed up to the App in the UK, with 2,000,000 of those registering in the first two weeks it was available. Analysis of the data generated led to: 

 1. The World Health Organisation, Public Health England and the UK Office for National Statistics updating their guidance on anosmia and delirium as key symptoms of COVID\-19. 2. Identification of rate and location of new infections in real time, which informed the UK Government’s national strategy for containing infection. 

 3. Identification of the symptoms and duration of Long COVID for the first time in a non\-clinical population, informing UK government policy and NICE guidelines. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background:** Since 2018, King’s researchers leading the Wellcome funded Longitudinal Population Study with a large set of volunteers from the well\-established King’s adult twins registry \(TwinsUK\), which have  pioneered the use of “digital cohort” App\-based approaches to collect detailed longitudinal datasets on diet and health from large numbers of participants, in real time, and at low cost. We applied artificial intelligence to analyse profiles of the twins and identify and predict biological responses to food. When the COVID\-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, little was known about the symptoms of the virus: King’s researchers saw an opportunity to rapidly redirect their existing technology and scientific expertise, by shifting from logging information on diet and health, to collecting daily data about potential symptoms, risk factors and consequences of COVID\-19 in real\-time. 

 **King’s researchers combined AI technology with cohort data to look at ways to improve human health through precision personalised nutrition.** Following the success of King’s work in relating health to gut microbiome differences **\(2, 3\),** in 2018 King’s spun out Health technology company ZOE Global and set up the largest in\-depth nutrition study in the world: PREDICT.In collaboration with the Biomedical engineering department at King’s, we used AI tools to show that people respond differently to food and that these differences could be predicted using several unique physiological and metabolic variables such as microbiome diversity and glucose levels **\(1\).** Most importantly, this breakthrough enabled us to develop App based tools to engage with the study participants in a new way, feeding back personalised insights on which foods may help that individual reduce dietary inflammation, improve gut health, and help users reach a healthy weight. 

 **Based on this underpinning research, King’s researchers responded to the COVID\-19 pandemic: with insight into how App technology could reach the wider UK population and gather daily reports on symptoms, they used AI methods on time\-series and geographical data to map the spread of disease.** In early 2020, King’s researchers designed the COVID Symptom Study App, collaborating with ZOE to put the content into a smart\-phone based platform enabling rapid dissemination. Combining information/observations drawn from the clinical experience of treating COVID\-19 patients of the team and their international network, King’s researchers designed the App to accurately target key symptoms. The App was launched on 23<sup>rd</sup> March, and between 24<sup>th</sup> March and 21<sup>st</sup> April 2020 alone, 2,450,569 UK and 168,293 US individuals began reporting symptoms through the smartphone App **\(4, 5\).** Deepening the existing collaboration with King’s School of Engineering enabled intensive, rapid development of software to use this huge dataset to understand and map COVID\-19, and estimate national and local COVID\-19 cases based on algorithmic prediction. The App was free and widely available for any UK resident to use and by December 2020, more than 4,000,000 people were using it. Participants were asked to log daily health updates and record a wide range of risk factors, symptoms \(temperature, tiredness, coughing, breathing problems, headaches etc\), whether or not they had tested positive for the virus and if so, the treatment they received. To encourage their ongoing participation, users had access to local data, latest research, information on risk factors, local and national trends, advice and the ability to keep track of self\-isolation. King’s researchers existing skills allowed them to continue to optimise the App in real time based on feedback from participants. 

 **The COVID Symptom Study App allowed King’s researchers to identify a number of symptoms of COVID\-19.** In total, by the end of 2020 King’s researchers had contributed to 18 papers published in peer reviewed scientific journals on symptoms of COVID\-19, and their relationship to clinical outcomes, with 511 citations in less than a year. The research uncovered: 

 **Evidence that anosmia is a key symptom of COVID\-19 \(4\).** Over 2,000,000 participants had reported their potential symptoms of COVID\-19 on our App since March 2020. Among the 18,401 who had undergone a SARS\-CoV\-2 test, the proportion of participants who reported a loss of smell and taste \(also known as anosmia\) was higher in those with a positive test result \(4,668 of 7,178 individuals; 65.03%\) than in those with a negative test result \(2,436 of 11,223 participants; 21.71%\). This formed the basis of our symptom\-based predictive algorithm, which has been widely used throughout the world. 

 **Evidence that Delirium can be the only presenting sign of infection in older adults \(6\).** King’s academics conducted research on COVID\-19 by analysing the symptoms of a cohort of 322 hospitalised and 535 community\-based older adults in the UK admitted to hospital between 1 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. The sample data came from the App, logged in by the participants themselves. The study found that delirium is a presenting symptom of COVID\-19 in frail, older adults. 

 **Evidence for Long\-COVID \(7\).** King’s researchers analysed data from 4182 people with COVID\-19 who logged their symptoms prospectively. 558 \(13.3%\) had symptoms lasting >28 days, 189 \(4.5%\) for >8 weeks and 95 \(2.3%\) for >12 weeks, which was significantly longer than controls who had viral symptoms but tested negative for COVID\-19. Long\-COVID was characterised by symptoms of fatigue, headache, dyspnoea, anosmia; and was more likely with increasing age, BMI and female sex, and was associated with experiencing more than five symptoms during the first week of illness.  We generated a predictive model which enables identification of Long\-COVID risk groups in the first week of illness. 

 **King’s monitored the spread of infection in the UK and identified COVID\-19 hotspots \(8\).** We analysed data from 2,873,726 App users living in England and showed that this triangulated closely with later national studies by the Office for National Statistics \(ONS\) and REACT \(Real\-time Assessment of Community Transmission Study\). We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R\(t\), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte\-Carlo. This enabled us to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers – ‘hotspots’ – with geographically granular estimates. We detected 15 of the 20 geographic regions with highest incidence, according to subsequent government test data. This therefore demonstrated that using real\-time data offered a route to rapidly identify emerging hotspots.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 King’s COVID Symptom Study App\-based research generated key evidence which widened the core symptoms for COVID\-19 testing, enabling contact tracing of infectious individuals world\-wide, and thus limiting spread and ultimately global deaths from the disease. Moreover, through providing critically early geographical data on predicted cases in the UK, the App enabled localised policies to reduce the spread of the virus, preventing health services from being overwhelmed. 

 **King’s App data led the WHO and the UK Government to include anosmia in official COVID\-19 symptoms lists.** Data from our COVID\-19 Symptom Tracking App confirmed, for the first time in non\-clinical patients’, the loss of taste and smell as the most predictive symptom of COVID\-19 \- 10 times more so than the initial officially listed symptoms, fever or cough **\(2\)**. As a result, the World Health Organisation \(WHO\) **\(E\)** and UK Government **\(F\)** added anosmia to the official list of COVID\-19 symptoms. This increased the medical community’s diagnostic capability, and ensured the public recognised this symptom as a sign that they may have COVID and took appropriate action to protect themselves and their community. Professor Peter Byass, advisor to WHO, said **\(E.2\)**: “Your \[King’s\] work, particularly in relation to anosmia, was really important in informing the discussions behind this and is much appreciated *.*” Sir Patrick Vallance, UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser \(GCSA\), confirmed that data from the App was one of the pieces of evidence reviewed which led to anosmia being added to the official case definition symptoms list for COVID\-19 in May 2020. He added **\(F.2\)**: “As estimated by NERVTAG at the time, this will have helped pick up 93% of symptomatic cases, up from 91% previously, which may have led to significant benefit over time.” 

 **King’s App data led the UK Government to include delirium in the official COVID\-19 symptoms list for the elderly.** The COVID Symptom Study showed that delirium \- a state of sudden confusion \- is a key symptom of COVID\-19 in older people **\(3\)**. Public Health England’s \(PHE\) Chief Medical Officer, as a result, updated its guidance, outlining the addition of delirium to the UK’s official list of COVID\-19 symptoms in the elderly, and advising doctors to test elderly people presenting with acute confusion for COVID\-19 **\(F.2\)**. This helped healthcare professionals in diagnosis, and increased awareness amongst the public and in care homes to recognise this symptom and take appropriate action to test and avoid spread. 

 **Research by King’s allowed the UK government to identify hot spots across the nation.** Thanks to the 4,200,000 people logging their symptoms and location in the App daily, the machine learning model algorithm provided information that was used by the different government bodies in England **\(F.2\)**, Wales **\(A.3\)** and Scotland **\(B.1\)**, to inform policies intended to slow rates of infection and allow health services to cope. The UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser stated **\(F.2\):** “\(…\) the App has been very useful in tracking the progress of the disease. Since March 2020, the data provided by the App has been informing SAGE advice to the UK government on COVID\-19. Research by King’s helped the UK government to identify hot spots across the nation showing the rates of infection in real time all over the UK, allowing identification of areas where rates of infection were growing rapidly. These data have also contributed to increased public awareness and facilitated better management of the disease, which has had an impact on the UK population, the NHS and COVID\-19 patients.” 

 **King’s App data uncovered key information about Long COVID\-19 informing the approaches of NICE and the UK government.** Data from our COVID Symptom Study suggests that while most people recover from COVID\-19 within two weeks, one in ten people will suffer symptoms after three weeks, and some may suffer for months **\(6\).** In December 2020, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) published guidelines on the management of long\-term COVID **\(G.1\)** heavily informed by King’s research. The Programme Director for NICE’s Centre for Guidelines said: “COVID Symptom Study data was made available to NICE at a critical moment in the development of the guideline, allowing the advisory panel to consider it when making recommendations on the identification and management of post COVID\-19 syndrome **\(G.2\).”** 

 Furthermore, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Matt Hancock confirmed: ""The findings of the Covid Symptom Study are stark and this should be a sharp reminder to the public, including to young people, that COVID\-19 is indiscriminate and can have long\-term and potentially devastating effects **\(H\)**."" The UK GCSA added that data from the App will continue to help track the symptoms of those suffering from Long COVID, to help understand more about its course and the long\-term impact of this disease on people’s lives **\(F.2\).** 

 **Data collected by the King’s App has continued to support the UK Government’s decision\-making on the pandemic \(D, F\).** The research conducted by King’s supported by the data from the App remains one of only ten studies that support the Government’s population surveillance programmes. These are essential to understand the rate of COVID\-19 infection, and how the virus has spread across the country. They have helped the Government assess the impact of measures taken to contain the virus, to inform current and future actions, and to develop new tests and treatments. The insight generated from the App along with data from other studies made a significant contribution in helping strengthen the government’s scientific understanding of COVID\-19, inform their policy decisions and work across the testing programme. In August 2020, the UK government further recognised the importance of the App by awarding ZOE Global a GBP2,000,000 grant **\(I\)**. They said the App is “the largest public science project of its kind anywhere in the world” and that it “will help control the spread of the virus by providing vital new intelligence on the scale of local outbreaks, inform our understanding of the virus and how it affects different demographics. *”* 

 **The Scottish and Welsh Governments and prominent health charities have endorsed the COVID Symptoms Study App.** The Welsh Government and NHS Wales **\(A\)** were the first to make an appeal for the public to download the App and log their data to help them understand and predict the developing situation of the disease in Wales. In April 2020, they released a press release where Welsh First Minister, Mark Drakeford, stated: “Having a range of evidence and data is crucial in helping us build a clear picture of how the virus is behaving and affecting everyone’s lives. Crucially this app can help us anticipate potential COVID hot spots and get our NHS services ready. I’m asking everyone in Wales to download the new COVID Symptom Tracker app, so you can help protect our workers and save lives **\(A.1\)** *.*” The Scottish Government also encouraged people to use the App in their official social media channels which in combination reach over 543,000 people. They stated: “The COVID Symptom Tracker is an app, approved by Scotland’s top clinicians, designed to study the symptoms of \#coronavirus and track how it spreads. We need as many people as possible to take part including people who are feeling well **\(B\)** *.”* Several key health charities in the UK also urged members and the general public to use the King’s App such as the British Heart Foundation, British Lung Foundation, National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, and Stand Up to Cancer **\(C\)**. 

 **Members of the public have also benefitted from using the App.** The App is free of charge and has been available since March 2020. It doesn’t just collect data, it also provides freely\-available, up to date information about COVID cases. It’s rated 4.7 out of 5 stars based on over 276,500 user ratings in the Apple **\(J.1\)** and Google Play App Store **\(J.2\)**. Anonymous reviews illustrate how well the App has been received by the public and what difference it has made in their lives while living through a pandemic. An anonymous review from April 2020 revealed **\(J.2\)**: “In our isolation feels like we are helping to stop the spread of COVID\-19 and the research into its spread with this app.” Another from December 2020 stated: “I have used this app from the start and it's comforting to know that my entries are being recorded and used to advance the fight against COVID. It is continually developing as new information is recorded and I gain more insight from the app rather than the usual media sources **\(J.2\)**.” 

 Reviews have also shown the difference the App has made in people with Long COVID symptoms **\(J.1\)**: “This app is very welcome both for its potential to enable better understanding of the illness, and for the fact that it makes those of us isolating with long term symptoms feel less alone. *”* \(May 2020\) “\(…\) for us the symptom tracker is very useful because it reveals the extent of the long\-term suffering that even a mild case of COVID\-19 can cause. Moreover in the absence of a proper response by the U.K. government this is much better than nothing.” \(April 2020\) “My youngest daughter is showing signs of long COVID like myself, so this app is great for me to keep track of my symptoms and hers. *”* \(November 2020\).

###  **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Dr Coulon’s research has for many years been at the forefront of innovative model development for the changing behaviour of modern energy markets and systems, particularly in light of traditional models failing to adapt to new regimes, structures and renewable sources. Coulon has worked with one of Europe’s largest energy companies and with three American firms to apply his models to their businesses. Coulon’s insights have enabled these companies to better understand and mitigate financial risk, make business decisions, value complex products or investments, and hedge changing risks. Ultimately, this allows them to maintain profits and avoid unforeseen losses while adapting to the energy landscape of the future. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Energy firms are currently managing a major transition to new, renewable energy sources and structures. During this time of rapid change, classical econometric models often fail. Instead, the sector needs flexible modelling frameworks that can be tailored to particular markets and applications. To meet these challenges, Coulon has developed practical and easily implementable structural models for energy markets, particularly electricity and natural gas, but also environmental markets for carbon emissions or green certificates. These models accurately and efficiently simulate outcomes over long\-term horizons and provide the basis for decision\-making strategies for broad portfolios of assets. 

 Coulon’s unique hybrid approach to modelling provides a major advantage over classical approaches. Pure econometric statistical price models that look only at price, without considering supply and demand drivers, miss the complexity of the market. At the other extreme are complex optimization models, which consider supply and demand details such as individual generator constraints. The hybrid structural models developed by Coulon \[ **R1**\] retain the advantages of simpler structural models while providing a greater level of detail, capturing regional fuel mixes, demand patterns and price variations in order to better manage and hedge against geographical distributions in supply and demand. **R2** describes some new material on tractable structural models that allow for explicit derivative pricing formulas – a key advantage in practice. 

 Both **R1** and **R2** focused on the US energy markets. Coulon has also adapted his structural power price models to the European market, where there are more challenges such as the large influx of intermittent renewables and related environmental targets. These challenges demand flexible new models and lend themselves more to structural models than econometric ones, since price histories are short and unreliable amid dramatically changing market conditions. The work in **R3** enhanced Coulon’s earlier modelling techniques and adapted them to several important obstacles in the German market, including the rapidly\-growing solar and wind power production that characterises the ongoing energy transition. **R4** explains Coulon’s mathematical modelling of tradeable certificate prices for green power – an important new product that had been entirely unexplored by other quantitative researchers. 

 Coulon’s ongoing research aims to extend natural gas and power price models to newer and more complex challenges facing European power markets during a time of cross\-border integration, technological change, and major supply\-side shifts due to renewables. Rigorously quantifying and managing these new interdependencies is critical to the business models of many energy firms.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Through proactive engagement and collaboration with the energy industry in both the US and Europe, as described below, Dr Coulon’s research has contributed significantly to the model development process in several energy companies. His research has enhanced firms’ trading, valuation and risk management capabilities \(for example, enabling better hedging against price volatility or more accurate pricing of new contracts or investments in physical assets\) and reduced their exposure to loss of profits. In the process, his work has contributed to a greater understanding of market risk and price behaviour. 

####  4.1 Applying structural models at a leading European energy company 

 As a result of his specialist research, Coulon was approached to collaborate with Alpiq, a leading Swiss energy company which operates in 31 European countries. The company produces power as well as selling it in the European markets. In 2019, Alpiq owned CHF7.4bn \(£6.08 billion\) of assets and supplied customers in Europe with 40 TWh of energy \[ **S1**\]. 

 Coulon’s work with Alpiq began in 2012 and led to a formal collaboration between the University of Sussex and Alpiq in 2018 \[ **S2**\] **.** The collaboration initially focused on price dynamics and hourly forward curve construction of the German power market \(EPEX\), as summarized in **R3**. Christian Jacobsson, former Head of Energy Artificial Intelligence at Alpiq, states: 

 *“*Michael’s innovative research on structural models for power prices allowed us to derive new insights into the dynamics of the German day\-ahead power market… A key advantage of the approach was the construction of forward price curves and distributions which correctly overlay detailed demand patterns, weather models, and fuel price changes in a tractable stochastic framework. This is critical for the firm when accurately pricing complex assets or contracts, thus increasing profitability while also minimizing risk across our portfolio. Such models have been applied to the entire asset portfolio, power and gas, and especially for the pricing and operative management of the non\-standard contract portfolio whose success can to a great extent be stated to rely on Michael’s contributions over many years.” \[ **S3**\] 

 In early 2018, Coulon’s work with Alpiq shifted towards new modelling challenges specific to the growth of renewables, and especially to wind park management. Coulon jointly developed new modelling techniques with Alpiq, which have “had an important impact on the firm’s approach to the new challenges linked to growing renewable generation” \[ **S3**\]. 

 Jacobsson describes the benefits of Coulon’s work for both Alpiq and society as a whole: 

 “The work has improved our ability to manage wind and solar parks offering their power while facing uncertain wind forecasts and highly volatile prices. This is a key component of Alpiq’s push to become a market leader in advanced optimization, trading and risk management solutions for the new energy markets. In addition to benefiting the firm directly, such solutions are critical to society in a world where electricity will be supplied by many distributed intermittent sources like wind and solar, hard to predict and uncontrollable.” \[ **S3**\] 

####  4.2 Advising and influencing decisions in US energy firms 

 Coulon worked with US energy company **Public Service Enterprise Group \(PSEG\)** between 2013 and 2017. Building on the ideas in **R1**, he developed solutions tailored to the firm’s specific needs for managing power price risk across a complex grid of generating units and customer demand. 

 Ismael Arciniegas Rueda \(Head of Structuring and Quantitative Analytics at PSEG from 2010 to 2017\) states that Coulon’s research “helped us to greatly expand our understanding of the markets, their price dynamics, and how to build rigorous mathematical models for predicting future changes” \[ **S4**\]. Insights from Coulon’s work influenced the firm to source the required percentage of renewables each year in a more cost\-efficient manner and “the implementation of models built on Michael’s research had a significant positive impact on the firm’s business decisions and profitability” \[ **S4**\]. 

 Rueda describes the nature and the significance of Coulon’s work, which provided the company with unique insights: 

 “Our initial project with Michael extended his earlier work on structural electricity price models to build in demand patterns and congestion effects at zonal or regional levels. The approach retained the attractive features of his previous analysis, such as quantifying the dependency on fuel forward prices, while facilitating the inclusion of new location\-specific constraints of the PJM market. The collaboration… was also valuable to PSEG’s trading activities. The model was used to inform the valuation and risk management of assets dependent on locational power prices which required forecasting for many years, a challenge which other models in the literature were not equipped to handle.” \[ **S4**\] 

 This initial collaboration led to a new structural price modelling project based on replicating and extending Coulon’s “ground\-breaking research” \[ **S4**\] on solar renewable energy certificate \(SREC\) markets \[ **R4**\]. Rueda explains the value of this modelling for PSEG: 

 “His was the first formal framework developed for predicting the behavior of these certificate prices, and linking them to their key fundamental drivers. As these were very illiquid and volatile markets prone to large price swings, this model was especially critical in providing a benchmark for our traders to better understand and forecast prices in challenging new markets.” \[ **S4**\] 

 Coulon has also collaborated with two other US companies, both of which have implemented power price models for clients based on his research. Scott Shander, Director of Analytics at **Commodity Risk Solution \(CRS\),** a US consultancy firm that provides solutions for renewable energy deals to corporate clients, describes his firm’s collaboration with Coulon: 

 “In 2017, we contacted Michael Coulon to build on his extensive research on structural models for electricity markets, in order to develop a new approach for a large client deal. Our collaboration with Michael over about six months focused on applying his modeling techniques to the Russian power market via a simulation study which facilitated a successful completion of the transaction. Through the use of Michael’s deep knowledge and research in the US markets, he helped CRS conduct a similar structural study of the electricity stack in Russia to aid in econometric fundamental analysis.” \[ **S5**\] 

 Shander explains how Coulon’s insights benefited CRS and its clients: 

 “This analysis proved critical for a buyside client negotiating a long\-term renewable energy transaction \(of total value over $60 million\) as it not only provided a thorough market risk assessment, it aided in deal structuring to meet the client’s objectives. Although at first glance quite complicated and technical academic papers, Michael’s research on electricity markets provides valuable insights and practical modelling tools that can make a clear difference in real world applications.” \[ **S5**\] 

 Between August 2013 and May 2015, Coulon collaborated with **Scoville Risk Partners**, which provides advice and analytics for the energy sector. During this time, he enhanced the company’s understanding of volatility and its links with other energy prices, as \[text removed for publication\] explains: 

 *“*The thoughts and insights embedded in Michael’s research \(not to mention the numerous discussions that we have had\) have influenced how we have approached these problems… His work on structural models of spot prices in commodities has directly impacted how we think about \(and model\) energy price series, in particular the nonlinear interaction of the prices of ‘fungible’ energy sources and what is generally referred to as the ‘spiky’ nature of such price series.” \[ **S6**\]

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Professor Hutton’s research improves legal professionals’ understanding of statistical evidence and enables resolution of medical litigation and life expectancy cases. The beneficiaries of this international economic and societal impact include legal professionals, pharmaceutical and medical device companies and patients. About £150m of awards for 200 personal injury cases was due to Hutton’s reports. 

 Statistical evidence prepared for Gee & Others v DePuy International Limited \[2018\] was key to the outcome; the ruling has been cited as a definition of defect under the Consumer Protection Act \(CPA\) 1987. Professor Hutton’s reports contributed significantly to the $11.7m settlement between Allergy Therapeutic PLC and Inflamax Research.

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Hutton’s \`Expert evidence: civil law, epidemiology and data quality' \[3.1\] summarises the insights on data and specific questions which inform her work in statistics and the law. Hutton’s research has substantial impact on legal processes and decisions. She collaborates with lawyers to provide resources and training as well as on particular cases. Two important issues are the phrasing of questions, and confirming the desired level of specificity for a particular case.  Changing the phrasing of a question can alter the assumptions made, and the probabilities or estimates provided. Given a well\-posed question, statisticians can find what data are available, directly or through research publications. \[3.1\]. 

 Easily obtained large data sets are often biased due to selection of people, and affected by missing data, limited measurement accuracy and coding errors. Hutton’s research considered methods for assessing whether missing data can be assumed to have little effect on conclusions, or whether adjustments can be made, or whether the robustness of conclusions must be evaluated. She worked with a PhD student and her colleague Professor Smith to use a recent approach to graphical models for asymmetric data, chain event graphs, as a technique to explore the nature of missing data \[3.2\]. Bayesian methods allow expert information to be included in the assessment, and the resultant graphs are effective in communication with non\-specialists. Studies which follow cohorts of people typically lose touch with some participants. With another PhD student, she developed methods to model changes over time, with repeated attempts to contact non\-participants, and to assess robustness of conclusions \[3.3\]. 

 Hutton’s work in statistics and ethics has shown that requiring informed consent can lead to particular sub\-populations being excluded from clinical research. Cultural differences with regard to privacy mean that it can be critical to use data from different countries to assess the effect of such selection biases \[3.4\]. Inadequate diagnostic tests and resulting subsequent procedures can result in unnecessary treatments \[3.4\]. This problem is particularly serious with large scale screening of people, such as that which followed media reports of adverse events associated with metal\-on\-metal total hip replacements \[3.4\]. Two main issues arose: whether rates of revision estimated from medical registers were unbiased and accurate; and the extent to which revision surgery decisions relied on weak diagnostic test based on blood metal levels. It was essential to observe that revision rates reported by Nordic registers differ from those of England and Wales. 

 Hutton’s substantive publications on survival of people with cerebral palsy continue to be cited by other experts in reports across a variety of jurisdictions \[3.5\]. The estimates of life expectancy which she provides include the consideration of data quality.  In addition, it is also necessary to consider different approaches to combining published results, with missing data within studies and different covariates reported across studies.  There is no standard approach to providing estimates of mortality, either in medical journals, or in expert witness reports, so Hutton has surveyed approaches and outlined future research \[3.6\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Hutton’s research has international economic and social impact by improving lawyers’ use of statistics and by underpinning expert witness reports, benefiting plaintiffs, defendants, companies and lawyers. Three examples of Hutton’s impact in litigation are highlighted, after a note on dissemination. 

 Hutton is the current Chair of the Royal Statistical Society \(RSS\) Statistics and the Law section. As Chair, she responded to a House of Lords Inquiry into Forensic Science and Forensic Science Regulatory concerns. She co\-authored best practice guides for advocates and judges and  gave 6 professional development seminars on statistical issues for barristers and judges since 2016 for, inter alia, American Association of Justice, Welsh Judicial Society and Inns of Court College of Advocates \[5.1\]. 

 **1. Gee & Others v DePuy International Limited \[2018\]** 

 Statistical evidence prepared for the metal\-on\-metal hip trial Gee & Others v DePuy International Limited \[2018\] was key to the outcome that DePuy was not liable; the ruling is a prime example of what defines a defect under the Consumer Protection Act \(CPA\) 1987, and has since been cited. 

  

 This case was brought under the Consumer Protection Act \(CPA – 1987\). Plaintiffs claimed that DePuy Pinnacle MoM hip prostheses were defective, tending to cause adverse reaction to metal debris \(ARMD\), hence further surgery. Hutton's review of the research and registry information focused on whether the statistics were robust, and was submitted as evidence for DePuy's defence. Hutton’s key contributions \[3.4\] were assessing the potential effects of registry completeness and missing confounding factors, and how the low threshold for diagnosing ARMD might inflate failure rates. 

 Finding DePuy not liable, Justice Andrews stated “one cannot possibly conclude” there was a “materially greater risk of failure than the comparator” \[5.2\]. Any pay\-out would have been a significant proportion of DePuy’s equity \(£130m, DePuy International Limited 2018 Annual report\).   In contrast, USA, plaintiffs with Pinnacle hip plants were awarded over $1bn \[5.3\]. 

 Hutton’s evidence directly informed the process for the legal team and interacted effectively with other experts' work. Her joint report provided a focused basis for cross\-examination. She provided live responses to the Claimants’ experts' evidence under cross\-examination \[5.4\]. 

 The impact of Gee has already been extensive. The ruling is now an authoritative example of how medical defects are considered under CPA, “starkly different” from previous rulings \[5.5\].  The High Court and other Senior courts have endorsed this precedent on the standard of evidence required to prove causality for medical devices. \[5.5\]. 

 Gee has also been cited as an exemplar product liability case in the textbooks and practitioner guides \[5.6\]. 

 **2. Allergy Therapeutics PLC \(ATL\) v Inflamax Research \(IR\) Settlement** 

 Hutton’s expert reports were ""invaluable to us and no doubt a factor in this settlement"" between ATL and IR, worth $11.7m to ATL \[5.8\]\). 

 Cooley LLP, acting for ATL, instructed Hutton in a claim against IR regarding the quality of a trial of hayfever treatments, which required exposure of participants to pollen concentration within a target range. However, pollen measurements were variable and often out of range. Hutton evaluated the opposing expert evidence, which claimed that failure to maintain correct pollen concentration did not affect outcomes. Drawing on her methodological research on the potential influence of missing data plus how averages of measurements on a person over time can hide important effects, Hutton prepared a joint report with the IR expert, and explained to ATL's barristers why the trial results were not reliable. 

 The settlement was key for ATL achieving profitability in 2019: “The strong operating performance and the settlement of the legal case with Inflamax led to a net profit of £3.5m” \[5.7\]. 

 **3. Informing international life expectancy settlements** 

 Hutton’s reports made a difference of about £150m in 200 personal injury cases, out of total awards of £500m \- £700m.  Awards cover ongoing care costs for those with debilitating permanent conditions, impacting directly on quality of life. 

  

 Canada: “These cases and settlements are life changing for the clients, and an accurate life expectancy opinion is crucial to ensure that the child has enough funding to care for his or her lifelong needs. We have requested Hutton as an expert witness on 3 occasions due to her well\-known expertise on life expectancy, including the nuances of the statistics in the area. She is very knowledgeable in understanding the debate over the various databases on life expectancy for children with cerebral palsy and talented in writing reports in this regard.”\[5.9\] 

 UK: “We have requested Hutton as an expert witness on six occasions due to the impeccable quality of her statistical evidence and reputation as a leading life expectancy expert witness.” \[5.9\]. 

 Australia “We have requested Hutton as an expert witness on at least 15 occasions due to the deserved reputation as leading legal consultant for life expectancy in catastrophic injury cases. Overall in every instance that Slater & Gordon has worked with Hutton, she has provided a detailed analysis of great quality.”\[5.9\] 

 The range of injuries affecting survival include traumatic and acquired brain injuries \(51 reports\), spinal cord injuries \(19\) and cerebral palsy \(70\). Cases come from the UK \(141 reports\), Australia \(34\), Canada \(7\) and Eire \(18\). The few UK neurological injury life expectancy witnesses typically cite Hutton's research, as do the California\-based Life Expectancy Project experts.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research which tested the effectiveness of a scheduling system to manage patients’ antenatal care visits in southern Mozambique has reduced average patient waiting times by 100 minutes and contributed to a 16\-percentage\-point increase in the number of women receiving the World Health Organization\-recommended minimum four antenatal care visits. Patients attested to the benefits of the scheduling system in reducing logistical barriers to attending antenatal care services and improving overall household wellbeing. The success of this management intervention has seen the Ministry of Health declare it a national priority for 2017\-2024 and include it in its official Strategy Plan. The intervention has since been rolled out across a further 46 antenatal care units and extended to 40 HIV units in public clinics across four provinces in southern Mozambique, covering more than 217,000 patients, alongside a wider programme of capacity\-building at the clinic level. The government has also initiated the nationwide scale\-up of the intervention in both central and northern Mozambique. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 In 2014, Dr Sandra Sequeira began a collaboration with the Ministry of Health in Mozambique, investigating whether reducing patient waiting times can increase the demand for healthcare and improve the quality of care. The project was focused on maternal health, a critical area of primary healthcare **\[1\] \[2\]**. 

 The provision of antenatal care in Mozambique faces particular challenges of patient retention. While the majority \(91%\) of women visit a health centre to seek antenatal care over the course of their pregnancy, only little more than half \(55%\) receive the World Health Organization\-recommended minimum four antenatal care visits \(Demographic and Health Survey Mozambique, 2011\). On the technical side, even when women do receive the recommended number of antenatal care visits, they do not always receive high\-quality care as core procedures do not always take place. For example, only 43.6% of women receive the necessary three doses of intermittent preventative treatment for malaria, just 51% of HIV\+ pregnant women receive antiretroviral treatment, and only 18.6% of HIV\+ pregnant women receive care ensuring the prevention of mother\-to\-child transmission of HIV \(IMASIDA, 2015\). 

 The experience of seeking care in public facilities often involves waiting all day in a queue.  According to survey data from 2012, 74% of individuals responding to a survey about problems with health systems report that they have experienced very long wait times in public clinics \(Afrobarometer, 2012\). Like most developing countries, tools for managing patient flow in Mozambican public facilities, such as an appointment system for scheduling next visits, are almost non\-existent. There is no universal policy from the Ministry of Health for how to prioritise the order of the queue with most clinics taking patients on a first\-come, first\-served basis or, in some instances, by the payment of a bribe. Patients typically arrive early in the morning at the clinic and often have to wait several hours to be seen. On busy days, patients may wait all day only to be turned away if nurses leave before seeing all patients. This coordination failure that results in long waiting times can be particularly constraining for patients who need to seek frequent care, such as pregnant women. 

 In fact, mothers attending antenatal care likely have numerous other responsibilities \- the average woman in Mozambique has 5.6 children. Furthermore, the hassle costs of antenatal care may be relatively salient compared to the benefits of care, which occur largely in the future. In the case of maternal health, antenatal care is often the first interaction a pregnant woman has with the health centre. The initial experience of waiting all day for poor\-quality care is likely to have significant downstream negative effects. A perception of non\-responsive care may also weaken the relationship between patient and provider, leading patients to be less likely to comply with medical advice. In the case of maternal health, high\-quality maternal care is associated with facility delivery. Women who have negative experiences during antenatal care may therefore be less likely to return for delivery in the facility. The role of waiting time, how it affects perceptions of healthcare quality, and how this in turn affects demand for healthcare services and compliance with healthcare advice has been fairly understudied in economics and in public health. 

 To address this, working with the National Institute of Health and the National Directorate of Public Health and Provincial Health Authorities, and in further collaboration with the Harvard School of Public Health, Sequeira co\-designed an appointment scheduling system to increase the efficiency of public health provision in antenatal care. The scheduling system was assessed between September 2016 and July 2017. This pilot was implemented in four high\-volume urban and peri\-urban clinics located in different provinces in southern Mozambique, covering over 8,000 patients. 

 Evidence from the pilot study showed that scheduling appointments reduced waiting times for antenatal care. Despite concerns that, even after scheduling, patients might continue to arrive early in the morning to guarantee a place in line, the study found that most patients arrived before or during their scheduled time, thus reducing an important coordination failure across patients and providers that rested on decades of social norms around queuing. 

 Scheduling was also found to have increased the number of patients to have received complete \(WHO\-recommended four visits\) antenatal care during pregnancy. This study was the first to provide evidence that appointment scheduling can increase service utilisation, suggesting that poor patient experience may contribute to poor health outcomes by decreasing utilisation. 

 Sequeira co\-led the study design, along with Dr Margaret McConnell \(Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health\), and Dr Maria Steenland \(Brown University\), Amanda de Albuquerque \(Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro\), and Janeth Dula, Quinhas Fernandes, Rosa Marlene Cuco, Sergio Chicumbe, and Eduardo Samo Gudo \(Ministry of Health, Mozambique\). Sequeira initiated the project, established the required partnerships, has overseen the fieldwork, and been responsible for coordinating all the required research and policy activities with the Ministry given her familiarity with the Mozambican context, her experience in running experimental work in Mozambique, and the fact that she is a native speaker of Portuguese. She has conducted presentations and held meetings with the National Director of Public Health and the Director of the National Institute of Health regularly since 2014. She is also leading the analysis and writing of manuscripts that are currently in preparation to assess the medium to long\-term effects of the intervention.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The underpinning research has had diverse impacts in Mozambique. First and most importantly, the evidence generated by the study revealed that the scheduling system significantly reduced patient waiting times and increased attendance of the recommended minimum four antenatal care visits. Testimonies of the patients involved in the scheduling intervention also revealed the attendant benefits to their lifestyle and wellbeing, reducing anxiety and enabling patients to effectively balance their other professional and domestic responsibilities. Providers reported lower levels of stress and longer consultation times. In response to these findings, the Ministry of Health provided funding support to expand the scheduling system to other health services and to other regions of the country. The Ministry also requested the research team put in place a wider programme of capacity\-building, providing technical support and training to healthcare clinic staff on how to successfully introduce management interventions at the clinic level. These impacts are described in greater detail below. 

 **Reducing antenatal care patient waiting times** 

 After implementation of the scheduling intervention, waiting time data for antenatal care was collected for 6,918 women **\[1\]**. Results showed that appointment scheduling shifted the distribution of arrival times for antenatal care to later in the day. Previously, 62% of women seeking antenatal care in treatment facilities arrived before the facility first opened at 8am. During follow\-up rounds, this percentage declined to 22%. Forty\-eight per cent of patients arrived before their hour\-long appointment window. The average of mean daily waiting time across the three facilities at baseline was 182 minutes. Average waiting time after scheduling ranged from 85 to 107 minutes, a decrease of between 41% and 53% from baseline. Regression analysis, controlling for day of the week effects, showed a decline in waiting times of 100 minutes after implementation of the scheduling intervention. The scheduling intervention was particularly successful in clinics with higher volumes of patients **\[A\]**. 

 **Increased completion of WHO\-recommended minimum of four antenatal care appointments** 

 An important outcome of interest was whether implementation of the scheduling system also led to an increase in patient retention and utilisation of healthcare services, and particularly whether it would encourage more women to complete the WHO\-recommended minimum of four antenatal care appointments during pregnancy. Results of the study, tracking antenatal care attendance over the course of pregnancy for 8,385 women, showed that, among the cohort of women who were exposed to the scheduling intervention during all 40 weeks of pregnancy, a 16\-percentage\-point increase in attendance of the recommended minimum four antenatal care appointments was observed **\[B\]**. These findings suggest that long waiting times compromise the quality of patients’ experience, leading to poor health outcomes by negatively affecting attendance of antenatal care appointments and decreasing healthcare utilisation. 

 **Patient wellbeing** 

 As part of the impact assessment work, 38 interviews were collected between May and June 2017 at three clinics in southern Mozambique. Questions were open\-ended and invited participants to discuss their decision to attend antenatal care, their experiences at the clinic, and their experiences with the scheduling system. Previously, in their experiences without a scheduling mechanism, patients faced unpredictable and long wait times and uncertainty about whether they would be seen at all. The women interviewed felt it was important to seek antenatal care but encountered problems such as difficulty in arranging time off work, finding childcare, or having to forego other domestic responsibilities. The scheduling system improved this experience by reducing time spent at the clinic for antenatal care appointments, thereby also addressing logistical challenges and reducing uncertainty around when patients would receive care. 

 With a scheduled appointment, patients no longer had to anticipate ""burning"" or sacrificing an entire day at the clinic. They described being able to better plan their day around the clinic visit, which allowed them to resume their responsibilities before and after their appointment and rely less on the aid of others: "" *In that old system you would get up early and come here and wait until 2pm while you didn’t do anything at home. Now you can plan, you wake up at 5am, clean the backyard, do the dishes, clean the house, then make breakfast for the children who then leave, and you stay preparing the curry \[dinner\]*"" **\[C\]**. 

 One patient identified the principal benefit of the scheduling system as having made her appointment days more predictable, regarding both when she leaves for the clinic and when she returns home: "" *I think it’s better with the booking system...because when we know what time we’ll be seen we can schedule the time we leave the house and what time we’ll get back – we more or less know our schedule for the day*"" **\[C\]**. 

 Importantly, patients reported the fact that healthcare workers were less stressed and more likely to have longer consultations that would include all routine checks and procedures. This suggests the important role that management capacity at the clinic level can play in shaping both the perceived and actual quality of care. 

 **Benefits to healthcare workers** 

 Healthcare workers reported improved working conditions as a result of the scheduling system. In interviews conducted as part of the impact assessment, nurses described how not having to manage a crowded waiting room has given them time to devote to other aspects of their work: "" *For our health centre that used to get really full it’s been beneficial. Nurses have more time to think what to do. It’s going to help us all. It would be good if it were expanded to other kinds of appointments*"" **\[D\]**. Similar to patients, the nurses were also able to strike a better work\-life balance and reduce burnout and absenteeism: "" *with the new system, things got better. \[…\] I leave on time and don’t get home tired*"" **\[D\]**. 

 **Inclusion as a priority in the Mozambique Ministry of Health official strategy** 

 Following the success of the study, the scheduling strategy became a national priority of the Ministry of Health for 2017\-2020 and became part of the Ministry’s official Strategy Plan **\[E\] \[F\]**. In a January 2018 television appearance addressing the frequent complaints about “enchentes” \(queuing\) at healthcare facilities, the Minister of Health presented the scheduling system as a solution, mentioning that the new scheduling system had been trialled successfully and was now in the process of being scaled up **\[G\] \[H\]**. 

 Expansion of the intervention 

 The Ministry requested support from the research team to expand the intervention to other areas of healthcare provision and to other parts of the country. Since the first study, the scheduling system has been rolled out across 46 antenatal care units on an experimental basis. Importantly, the government requested support for a rapid expansion of the scheduling system to help manage access to care for patients with chronic diseases such as HIV \[I\]. The extension of the scheduling system to chronic diseases holds potential to have an even wider impact on economic outcomes. HIV/AIDS remains one of the deadliest diseases in many sub\-Saharan African countries. In fact, Mozambique has the eighth\-highest HIV prevalence rate in the world \(12.5% in 2016\). Despite recent progress in testing and starting patients living with HIV on antiretroviral treatment, low adherence to treatment threatens to undermine these recent advances. Only 54% of patients remain active in treatment after 12 months. Loss of treatment can increase the spread of the disease and intermittent treatment can build drug resistance, reversing past gains. Long waiting times to access regular care and collect medication are considered a major driver of low demand for HIV treatment. Male patients are less likely to seek treatment because of the risk of job loss due to absence from work, while female patients face similar work trade\-offs on top of childcare responsibilities. Lack of treatment for female patients can exacerbate the problem of mother\-to\-child transmission of HIV. 

 The intervention has already been expanded to 40 HIV treatment units in public clinics across three provinces in Mozambique \[I\]. Taken together, with an average of 1,500 antenatal care patients and 3,700 HIV patients enrolled in treatment in each facility, this represents an extension of the research initiative to cover more than 217,000 patients \(50% of all patients in Mozambique’s four southern provinces of Maputo City, Maputo Province, Gaza, and Inhambane\). 

 **Providing an evidence base for increased investment in health services** 

 The Mozambican government’s commitment to extending the benefits of the research intervention is evidenced by the allocation of significant funds \(approximately USD200,000\) by the Ministry of Health and its research branch, the National Institute of Public Health, to support the expansion of the intervention **\[F\]**. In addition to funding the implementation across the four provinces in the south \(and the pilot launch of the intervention in central and northern Mozambique\), resources have also been made available for a wider programme of capacity\-building, to ensure the sustainability of the intervention beyond the project timeline. The research team has been funded to provide substantial technical support and training for staff at both province and district level, who can in turn train nurses and clinicians at the selected facilities. This “training of trainers” strategy will ensure continued feasibility and quality. Community mobilisation events have also been held to raise awareness among patients, while supervisory networks have also been established and trained among health authorities at the central, provincial, and district levels. 

 Overall, the implementation of the scheduling intervention has been a significant success and has been acknowledged as such by senior personnel in the Ministry of Health. It has also been used to help to mitigate the strain on health facilities during the Covid\-19 pandemic **\[J\]**. The Deputy Director\-General of the National Institute of Health \(a collaborator on the project\) has attested to these benefits: “ *This project represents a ground\-breaking collaboration between health specialists and economists to improve the primary care system in Mozambique. The project has received strong support from the Ministry of Health and is a national priority for health. It has also become extremely relevant during the current pandemic as it aims to avoid crowded health facilities and ensure that patients with chronic diseases and those in need of regular care such as maternal and childcare continue to access health facilities effectively and safely on a regular basis*” **\[E\]**. In particular, the research team has played a critical role in ensuring that there is a rigorous assessment of the expansion of the scheduling intervention, to identify the critical factors for the success of this type of management\-level intervention and how it should be customised across clinics with varying levels of managerial capacity. This evidence\-based approach is more likely to enable effective and sustainable change in the health system. 

 The quality of healthcare gained greater prominence in the international health systems agenda with the 2018 publication of the Lancet Global Health Commission’s Report on High\-Quality Health Systems, which aims to ensure that the quality of healthcare increases alongside global coverage targets set by the Sustainable Development Goals. Against the backdrop of rapid urbanisation across sub\-Saharan Africa, the problem of overcrowded facilities and congestion is expected to be significantly exacerbated over the next 20 years. This intervention has been shown to improve the management of public healthcare delivery in settings in which urban congestion and poor management of patient flows is a consistently recognised constraint, even beyond the Mozambican context. At present, over 50% of respondents to the Afrobarometer survey highlight queuing for healthcare as a key concern. The scheduling system is easily scalable and transferable to other spheres of healthcare provision in the country, requiring minimal staff training and limited financial resources. In fact, the research team received a WHO competition award for this project, with the committee commending both its "" *strong potential to directly impact future work to reduce wait times and improve flow of care in the high\-burden HIV clinic setting and other areas*"" and the involvement of high\-level policymakers in the project team **\[K\]**. The project has also received funding support from the World Bank, J\-PAL, and the International Growth Centre. All funders can provide a global platform for the dissemination of the intervention across countries.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 The 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the birth of punk in the UK was celebrated in 2016 with a year\-long series of events in London which many in the punk community felt did not represent their past in a culturally appropriate way. The representation of subcultures has long been problematic, as by their very nature they tend to avoid engaging with the establishment \(academia\) or commerce. Worley’s grassroots approach to research offered an alternative narrative in the build\-up to the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary by overcoming the barrier between the punk subculture and the establishment. Worley’s research has helped people to reimagine and thus have a richer understanding of British punk\-related cultures and British youth culture more generally. His participatory approach to social history has had a profound effect on this traditionally hard to reach community.  He has influenced participants’ behaviour and that of stakeholders in the cultural, archival and commercial sectors; contributed to entrepreneurial activity; and stimulated local tourism by generating events and exhibitions. Most importantly, he has helped to preserve, conserve and present a cultural legacy that has generated new forms of historical practice and creative expression. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Worley has led research on the history of subcultures through a Leverhulme funded project: Punk, Politics and British Youth Culture 1975\-85 \(2013\-15\) that examined the relationship between  [youth cultures, politics and social change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5Ohxn1pJH8). To underpin this work, Worley co\-founded the Interdisciplinary Network for the Study of Subcultures, Popular Music and Social Change \(Subcultures Network\) in 2011, funded by an AHRC Network Grant and hosted by the University of Reading. The Network’s aims were to promote and facilitate research exploring the ways in which subcultures and popular music serve as mediums for social change; to encourage interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of subcultures, popular music and social change; to initiate and sustain a dialogue between scholars whose work focuses on subjects relating to subcultures, popular music and social change through regular workshops, symposia and conferences; to provide support and opportunities for peer\-review towards funding proposals related to the study of subcultures, popular music and social change; to instigate and amass a significant body of scholarly work examining the relationship between subcultures, popular music and social change. These aims were primarily achieved through a series of symposia between 2013 and 2015 and resulted in a series of publications \(outputs 1–6\): 

-  Riotous Youth \(October 2013, Bristol\) 

-  Sound Affects \(April 2014, Norwich\) 

-  In/between Spaces \(September 2014, Liverpool\) 

-  Political Subcultures \(March 2015, Surrey\) 

-  Global Subcultures, Local Identities \(June 2015, West London\) 

 Integral to Worley’s approach has been decentralising the prevailing – media\-driven – narratives of Punk that centred on London and Manchester. Indeed, the Subcultures Network exists to enable academics and cultural practitioners to co\-operate and thereby co\-create histories from materials and experiences embedded in local cultures. By applying this “theory\-into\-practice” approach, the Network has produced a history of punk that is “ours” rather than “mine”, “yours” or “theirs”. 

 The starting point for the project was a study of punk in Norwich. Worley met with members of Norwich’s punk community to discuss gathering material for an article. Further contacts led to reams of ephemera, emerging from private collections and discussions brought forward memories and reminiscences.  Instead of an article, the research generated a historical account that reflected its subject; materials and memories were combined with a historical overview to create a history in fanzine form: Young Offenders: Punk in Norwich, 1976\-84. 

 One of those interviewed was the marketing manager for “Norwich Lanes” who had been a punk himself in his teens. He suggested developing a series of local events to coincide with the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of punk in 2016. Consequently “Punk in the East” was born, and in November 2016, the Norwich Arts Centre hosted a launch event, featuring The Ruts \(whose Norwich gig in 1979 is often cited as one of the most exciting the city has ever hosted\).. Local shops, pubs and cafes in the Norwich Lanes participated to form a trail – hosting photos, ephemera and artworks from the 1970s–80s – highlighting spaces important for the cultivation of punk culture in the region. Through November and December 2016, further gigs and a film show were held, and the Bridewell Museum, Norwich, incorporated a punk display into its “wider social history of Norwich” exhibit. This was curated by erstwhile punks, whose own clothes, records, fanzines and posters formed the displays, representing Norwich youth culture in the 1970s–80s. 

 The project continued to thrive after the anniversary celebrations, enabling ongoing collection of Norfolk’s punk history. In collaboration with the Norwich Museum, which had already provided facilities to scan materials for the events of 2016, a virtual exhibition was devised.  Materials were collated during 2017 and ‘18 and the “Punk in the East” website launched as a living archive in August 2018. Further physical events have since been held under the Punk in the East banner and an event inspired by the project ‘No Glue. No Glass Bottles’ took place in Sunderland in 2017. More recently, Worley’s research and the Subcultures Network, together with the Punk in the East project and website, have inspired the Youth Club Archive’s plans for a Youth Culture Museum. In 2020, a virtual Museum of Youth Culture was launched, and Worley is now working with the Archive towards developing a physical version of the museum.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 In contrast to the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of punk events in London, which many in the subculture felt were imposed on them for commercial gain, the events in Norwich, and those it inspired beyond, were embraced by the former and current members of the punk community, who took ownership of the events as their history. The overarching theme of these projects and events has been to empower individuals with an active interest in their own history to engage with it and share it in ways that resonate with them. 

1.  **Cultural impact on punk subcultures in Norwich and the UK:** 

 To provide an accessible focal point for groups and individuals interested in the work that Worley and the Subcultures Network were doing, a Facebook group was established \(in September 2020 it had 4,300 members, E1\). This provided a forum to discuss ideas for the “Punk in the East” project and enabled and encouraged people to engage in collating and validating their own history, producing and attending events born of their own creative endeavour. The material people shared was initially compiled in a fanzine comprising text and imagery offered by Norwich’s punk community \(E2\). After a run of 500 sold out, a further 500 fanzines were reprinted following requests by local books shops and individuals unable to secure an original copy. 

 Following the first meeting between Worley and the Norwich punks, another Facebook group “Punk in Norwich” was started, and its members continue to engage and share material. It currently has 963 members and serves as space for discussion about punk and its local history \(E1\). A further Facebook page, ‘Punk in the East’, served to promote the project itself and continues to promote related projects into 2020 \(currently 940 followers; E1\). One Norwich schoolboy punk who graduated to Backs Records and London’s Rough Trade, commented: “The \[…\] websites and Facebook pages have been such a great and useful tool in helping me reconnect with my past and engaging with punk history \[…\]. It's been invaluable in helping me remember the gigs, the music, the times and the people and has allowed me to reconnect with lots of people I'd lost touch with years and years ago, and rejuvenated my interest in the whole culture immensely.” \(E3\). 

 The main anniversary events in October\-December 2016 brought together past and present punks and created a sense of ownership of the past within the community. Unlike the officially sanctioned London\-centric “celebrations”, Punk in the East was developed with grass\-roots enthusiasts who had forged punk\-related cultures in Norfolk and nearby in the 1970s–80s. As one contributor \(Stephen Hansell, singer in The Disrupters\) who contributed memorabilia to the exhibition commented: “Back then I never thought for one minute that what we were doing would one day be regarded as social history \[…\] I don't think many people analysed it at the time, I know I didn't, it was just more of a compulsion, a way of life” \(E4\). A  [film of the launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrMWztfSxXs) captured the impact made on those attending, with comments showing how Punk in the East reinvigorated their interest, validated their cultural practice, and embodied their youthful experiences \(E5\). 





 The Punk in the East website, launched in August 2018, was collated from within the local community and continues to develop. Photos and images have been contributed by those in and around the city, but also from Britons living around the world who are keen to retain links to their youth and friends. Over 200 people have contributed items to the site to date, with two further large donations of material due to arrive after the coronavirus lockdown. In 2020, the website was receiving about 30 unique visitors a day \(E6\). The exhibition at the Museum of Norwich was curated by those who had amassed private collections or been members of local bands in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the exhibit was first placed in the museum in 2016 there has been a significant increase in footfall and a change in the demographic of visitor over the course of the exhibition \(E7\). 

 Worley’s expertise is widely sought. He has been invited to advise on subsequent local events that have been inspired by the original Punk in the East project and events, such as ‘Punk in the Provinces’ \(Norwich Arts Centre, November 2017 and Q&As with punk luminaries who visited Norwich under the Punk in the East banner. The project has also had significant reach beyond Norwich, inspiring cultural practitioners in Sunderland \(The Bunker Collective\) to devise a similar event \(9 September 2017\), replete with gigs and a website \(E8\). 

 Worley’s work has also influenced and inspired the London\-based Youth Club Archive to develop a Youth Culture Museum. In particular the organisation is adopting Worley’s methodology for community\-based and collaborative collection development, enabling people to take ownership of their social history and inviting the public to submit items to the museum. National Lottery Heritage Funding has been secured and plans are underway to develop the idea from online to a physical museum. The Archivist wrote: “We were incredibly impressed and excited by The Subcultures Network and the brilliant work Matthew Worley and his peers do. \[We\] felt that they were the perfect partners on our National Lottery Heritage Fund project to build the online Museum of Youth Culture. Working with Matthew enabled us to find the right academics and authors to write a narrative and build context to the archive, making the collection more accessible than it’s ever been.” \(E9\). 

 Much media attention was also generated. In Norwich, local TV, radio and print outlets reported on Punk in the East \(e.g. BBC Radio Norfolk interview in November 2016\). On 9–10 January 2018, ITV regional news ran a feature that developed the themes of the project, interviewing Professor Worley and various East Anglian punks to trace the cultural legacies into the twenty\-first century.  Nationally, Worley was interviewed on his wider research project on BBC Radio 6 on 5 April 2018 \(2,560,000 listeners\) and contributed to non\-academic writing events such as Louder Than Words \(Manchester, November 2017\) \(E7\). 

1.  **Socio\-economic impact on Norwich and its cultural venues:** 

 Punk in the East was developed in collaboration with Norwich Lanes and took place in October–December 2016. The launch at Norwich Arts Centre was sold out and attended by 200 people of all ages, among whom were photographers returning to document the people they had first photographed some 40 years previously. The wider series of events included an exhibition at the Museum of Norwich at the Bridewell and a trail around the Norwich Lanes. The exhibition brought increased footfall to the museum at a typically quiet time of year: “From the 22<sup>nd</sup> October \[…\] until Saturday 28<sup>th</sup> January we had 3,814 people through the door \[…\]. For roughly the same period the year before in 2015/16, we had 3,044 people through the door. So we are looking at an increase of 770 people.’ \(Norfolk Museums Service, 3 February 2017\) \(E7\). 

 At the end of the initial project, the Bridewell Museum continued to support the project, extending the exhibition, reconfiguring its displays of social and cultural history, and contributing to the collation of material for a website\-based ‘virtual exhibition’. The trail around Norwich Lanes took in numerous shops, pubs, cafes, arts spaces and cinema. Most of these had a connection to Norwich’s punk past, with traces of this displayed in shop windows or inside. Surveys following the project confirmed sold\-out events and increased footfall with local businesses and shop\-owners noticing a marked increase in the number of visitors to the lanes and their premises \(E10\). 

 Worley’s grassroots approach to social history has had a profound impact on a traditionally hard to reach community. In particular, he has developed an approach to collaborating with and enabling members of punk subcultures to take ownership of their social history. The research has been deeply transformative for those involved. The approach has enabled other organisations that are seen as part of the ‘establishment’ – such as a museum – to engage with previously hard\-to\-reach groups and demonstrate the possibilities of broadening their understanding of local social history. Worley’s methodology has also been adopted by other cultural groups, such as the Youth Culture Archive, seeking ways to engage with their target audiences and has enabled them to develop their own activities and make plans for a permanent museum.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The police method of stop and search in Scotland has been subject to dramatic change in its governing legislation, policy and practice which has improved its public accountability and enhanced social justice in policing. Police Scotland has over 17,000 police officers with responsibility for policing across Scotland. In response to research by Drs O’Neill \(Dundee\) and Aston \(Edinburgh Napier University\), Police Scotland has redesigned its database to improve recording and transparency, now publishes its records publicly, has retrained every police officer on their use of stop and search and has ended potentially harmful and unjust practices. From a peak of over 642,000 recorded searches per year in 2013/14, stop and search in Scotland has reduced to just over 41,600 searches in 2019/20 and non\-statutory \(consensual\) searches no longer take place. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 In contrast to England and Wales \(where stop and search has been subject to academic, political and public scrutiny for three decades\) there had been very little attention paid to stop and search policy and practice in Scotland. There was also a lack of published data, weak accountability and little oversight of the practice. In 2014, research by Dr Kath Murray \(University of Edinburgh\) highlighted that recorded searches in Scotland increased dramatically from 2005/2006 to 2012/2013 to a rate about four times that of England and Wales. Police Scotland came under intense political and media scrutiny to change its practice. 

 Police Scotland selected ‘P’ Division, the Fife area of Scotland with 828 locally deployed officers, as the site for a stop and search pilot. The pilot was launched in July 2014 and aimed to test new techniques in stop and search, an enhanced database, enhanced crime analysis and more complex community engagement practices. The purpose was to improve the data on which stop and search is based, improve accountability and increase confidence in the police. O’Neill and Aston were commissioned to conduct an independent academic evaluation to review the effectiveness of the pilot, which was co\-funded by The Scottish Institute for Policing Research \(SIPR\) and Police Scotland. O’Neill and Aston were equally responsible for the methodological design – a mixed methods approach – data collection, and analysis. 

  

 Their research found that there was a gap between the perceptions of senior officers in P Division and those of operational officers as to what the pilot was about and what it was meant to achieve. In particular, many officers interviewed had very little detailed knowledge of the pilot or how they were meant to change their stop and search practice **\[R1\]**. This revealed ineffective communication and training in relation to the pilot for both operational officers and their supervisors **\[R2\]**. However, senior officers also discussed the changes in the pilot as being framed as ‘business as usual’, which presented conflicting messages to officers **\[R3\]**. There were also particular practices which research suggested could be ineffective at best and harmful at worst \(see below\) **\[R3\]**. Findings in relation to weak communication, ineffective training, downplaying the significance of the change that was needed and poor practice was to be foundational in the subsequent design of the stop and search reform process in Police Scotland at a national level in 2016\-2017 **\[R4\]**. 

 There were five main findings which led to direct impact: **1.** Data suggested that Police Scotland **end the practice of non\-statutory \(‘consensual’\) searches.** Members of the public found searches embarrassing and detrimental to police\-community relations, and it was ineffective as an investigative tool due to the low success rate in any items being found. **2. Data analytics** could be improved by including contextual information, tracking changes over a longer period \(up to five years rather than year\-on\-year\) as well as tracking multiple searches of individuals. This would better account for the effects of seasonal variation, non\-regular events and indicate where searches are concentrated on a few individuals. **3.** **More robust training** and communication based on face\-to\-face teaching techniques was needed, rather than the online method used in Fife, as there had been little to no impact on the daily practice of officers involved in the pilot. Finally, two initiatives introduced for the pilot were unhelpful and potentially harmful and should be stopped: **4. The** **letter to parents** of children who had been stopped and searched was identified as a potential risk to children in households where interaction with the police is not looked upon favourably. **5. The telephone survey** of people who had been stopped and searched presented methodological and ethical problems, and was a potential risk to the welfare of people discussing searches over the phone, especially during working hours when the calls were conducted. Also, there was a significant amount of staff time spent making calls with no result \(not answered or refused\).

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The report **\[R1\]** made a total of 19 recommendations for change, all of which have been addressed, and the research on stop and search has led to direct impact in policy and practice for policing in Scotland. This has improved policing in Scotland by making it fairer and more accountable and thus has enhanced social justice in Scotland more generally. 

 In relation to **policy**, O’Neill and Aston have been involved in **a change to legislation governing police powers of stop and search**. Their research **\[R1\]**, as well as that of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary \(HMICS 2015\), recommended an end to non\-statutory searches. The Scottish Government responded by appointing an Independent Advisory Group \(IAG\). The IAG recommended the development of a code of practice and the complete abolishment of non\-statutory stop and search **\[E1\]**. The IAG report cites recommendation 9 \(only statutory searches should be used\) from the research **\[R1\]**. The Scottish Government and Police Scotland accepted the IAG recommendations in full and the Criminal Justice \(Scotland\) Act 2016 was amended accordingly. The amendment places stop and search on a statutory footing, with its use underpinned by a Code of Practice that came into force in May 2017. The research is heavily cited in the IAG report **\[E1\]**, with detailed coverage on pages 66\-67. The QC Solicitor Advocate responsible for leading the IAG confirms the influence of the research on the IAG recommendations: ‘ *Dr Megan O’Neill has been a key contributor to our work. Her research has assisted us from the time of our original review up to the point of finalising the Code of Practice… Dr O’Neill’s work on the Fife Pilot made a significant contribution to our views… While other research and position papers are mentioned in our Report, the Fife Evaluation Report was of particular significance*’ **\[E2\]**. From a peak of over 642,000 recorded searches per year in 2013/14 \(Murray, K; Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research Report No.6/2015\), stop and search in Scotland reduced to just over 41,600 searches in 2019/20 \(Police Scotland stop and search data, online\). Non\-statutory searches no longer take place. 

 **Improving the way data on stop and search is used internally to guide police activity**: Police Scotland has redesigned the stop and search database, and it is now publicly accessible. Although current resources do not allow for tracking multiple searches of any one individual \(as recommended\), manual monitoring of the data reveals where this is happening and the policing area concerned is alerted. In addition, Police Scotland has also developed a data system to assist area commanders when deciding where to deploy officers based on trends in crime and previous searches. O’Neill and Aston have been consulted on the development of this product. These changes to stop and search data have enabled Police Scotland to enhance its transparency and openness with the public. This is confirmed by Police Scotland, Assistant Chief Constable: ‘ *Their work has helped bring about positive changes to the way that we police, which in turn impacts on the communities that we serve as we continue to use stop and search as a valuable tool, but in a way that is lawful, proportionate and accountable, in order to nurture public trust and confidence*.’ **\[E3\]** 

 **Improving stop and search training:** The Fife Pilot used an entirely online training tool that had little impact on officers, many of whom could not remember taking it **\[R1\]**. To facilitate new stop and search practices, all existing officers up to the rank of Inspector, a total of 15,617, have now been retrained on the practice via new face\-to\-face training, and all new recruits receive the same. O’Neill was directly involved in the development of this training and has assessed its delivery. The Fife Pilot evaluation’s findings **\[R1\]** also informed the design of the new stop and search training: ‘ *Police Scotland have developed bespoke training, informed and guided by academic research and learning from the Fife Pilot and its evaluation, which provides specific learning on the impact stop and search can have on children and young people. …Taking the learning from the Fife Pilot Evaluation, the use of language during training and communication is focused on positive engagements and interactions*’ **\[E4\]**. Police Scotland surveys of officers after completion of the training show high rates of satisfaction with it \(98% immediately afterwards and after 6 months 84.5% of officers have high levels of confidence in using stop and search powers\) **\[E4\]**. 

 **Ending unhelpful** **communication with the public**: The research suggested that letters to parents, introduced as part of the Fife pilot, represented potential harm to the children concerned and should not continue. This influenced the position taken by the IAG and the research is cited in the Supplementary Report by the Advisory Group **\[E5\]**. The IAG agreed that the letters were problematic and as such, Police Scotland has ended this practice. 

 The QC refers to this in his letter about the work of the IAG when he says, ‘ *Subsequently, when further consultation took place as recommended in our Report, Dr O’Neill’s work featured again in relation to the issue of searching children for alcohol. This is acknowledged in our Supplementary Report which was issued to accompany the final Code of Practice. It will be seen that we quote directly from the Fife Evaluation Report on the thorny question of intimation to parents*.’ **\[E2\]** 

 The telephone survey of people who have been searched has also been dropped from stop and search governance processes.  The Police Scotland response to the Fife Pilot evaluation \(‘The SIPR Report’\) **\[E6\]** accepted the recommendations: ‘ *Following discussions it was deemed it was not practical for Police Scotland to pursue this any further due to substantial cost implications, inaccurate data through the recording of telephone numbers and lack of qualitative and quantitative responses as observed within the Fife Pilot’*. This has spared members of the public from violations of their privacy and has allowed for redeployment of those resources. 

 By October 2017, all of the report’s 19 recommendations **\[R1\]** had been addressed and this is described in detail in the Police Scotland ‘SIPR report’ response **\[E6\]**. Police Scotland has published three Improvement Plans since June 2015 which track progress against the recommendations of all the stop and search review reports \(HMICS, SPA, IAG, their own review and the Fife evaluation\) **\[E7\]** 

 **Impact beyond the evaluation**: O’Neill and Aston contributed to a number of policing committees including *Police Scotland Research and Evaluation Operational Review Group* \(REORG\) and the *Stop and Search Strategic Group*, to monitor and guide the ongoing reform process **\[E3, E8, E9\]**. Through these, they have been instrumental in building evidence\-based practice in stop and search in Scotland. The Inspector of Constabulary \(HMICS\) explains the impact that their research input has had in improving stop and search policy and practice in Scotland: *‘The research findings, along with Dr O’Neill and Dr Aston’s ongoing engagement with Police Scotland and the SPA… throughout the stop and search improvement journey, and their proposals for further research on the relationship between stop and search with other areas of community policing, local enforcement and prevention has been highly influential. This has led to significant improvements in the use and recording of stop and search activity in Scotland as highlighted in our Audit and Assurance Review of Stop and Search Phase 2 report, published in February 2017*’ **\[E8\]**. 

 **Impact beyond stop and search:** The experience of the stop and search reform process and the related engagement with academic researchers, including O’Neill and Aston, has impacted policing in Scotland more generally. Police Scotland states in the *Improvement Progress Report for the Cabinet Secretary for Justice* \(June 2019\), that, ‘ *The lessons learned throughout the stop and search improvement journey are informing the wider policing approach, with the recent remodelling of Licensing and Violence Reduction Division and National Safer Communities to form a single Safer Communities Business area and provide a collaborative, preventative and evidence based focus across all of the policing priorities*’ **\[E4\]**. 

 The Director of Strategy and Performance at the Scottish Policing Authority \(SPA\) confirms this wider contribution when he writes that: ‘ *During their time as REORG members, Drs O’Neill and Aston have engaged considerably with Police Scotland and the SPA… From the perspective of the SPA, the value of having access to relevant and robust external evidence is being recognised more and more frequently when consideration is being given to organisational change and policy development, and evaluating the effectiveness of change that has been implemented and performance review against outcomes*’ **\[E9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Environmental noise and poor acoustics in the built environment are known to create numerous short\- and long\-term health problems, including cardiovascular disease, sleep disturbance and poorer work performance \(World Health Organisation\). University of Salford research has addressed poor acoustics through better ISO standards and guidance used in buildings, product design and noise assessment. These methods have been adopted as standard practice by government bodies, test houses and manufacturers, particularly in construction and transportation \(automotive and aerospace sectors\). Direct commercial exploitation of our research by companies \(e.g. Audi, **\[text removed for publication\]** and Siemens\) have impacts including reduced noise, improved music and speech communication in buildings and lower weight of vehicles to lessen energy consumption. For example, **\[text removed for publication\]** cites Salford’s research as being pivotal to them gaining **\[text removed for publication\]**. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 There are five strands of research that have improved the sound in the built environment by tackling problems at the noise source \(A & E\), during transmission through structures \(A & B\), during transmission within rooms \(C\) and understanding how humans respond to sound \(D\). 

 **A\) Structure\-borne sound** 

 Characterising vibration sources is difficult because their motion is influenced by the structure they are connected to, and so experimental data is only representative of the specific installation for which it is measured. Moorhouse, Elliott et al developed an in\-situ blocked force method that, for the first time, allowed sources to be independently characterised by measurement on a test rig **\[3.1\]**. Salford’s method provides vital input data that allows vibration through buildings and products such as cars to be simulated, the subsequent noise to be estimated and mitigation measures designed. Salford had a KTP with Farrat Isolevel applying the methods to building \(KTP0010582\) and other key projects include EPSRC grants **\[3\]**. 

  

 **B\) Building envelope** 

 Metal cladding constructions must meet high specifications for thermal and sound insulation. This requires multiple layers, including corrugated sheets with fasteners at regular intervals. Acoustic modelling for this combination of features is highly challenging. In 2017, an improved method for predicting the noise transmission was developed by Salford and validated on measurements of complex roof structures **\[3.2\]**. The novel contributions in **\[3.2\]** are: \(i\) It combines the well\-established transfer matrix method with a new approach for handling regular point fixings; \(ii\) It provides a method for deriving properties of panels in the form needed for the prediction model. The implementation of the models was funded by the industry trade association \(Metal Cladding and Roofing Manufacturers Association\) for the value of GBP67,860 **\[3\]**. 

 **C\) Room acoustic diffusers** 

 These are used to make a space fit\-for\-purpose, for example enhancing the quality of music in theatres and studios or improving speech intelligibility in churches. Cox, Lam et al proposed a new approach to measure and characterise the performance of diffusers **\[3.3\]**. In addition, Angus and Cox proposed methods that significantly improve performance through the way diffusers are grouped together **\[e.g. 3.4, pp. 345\-351, 400\-403\]** and these were protected in two patents **\[e.g. 3.5\]**. Both the performance characterisation method and the novel way of grouping diffusers led to new designs being installed worldwide during the census period. 

  

 **D\) Low frequency noise** 

 This causes extreme distress to those who are sensitive to it – the estimated prevalence of such sensitivity is about 10% of the population. It causes annoyance, often accompanied by effects such as headaches, concentration difficulties, palpitations and sleep problems. Moorhouse, Waddington et al developed a procedure for the assessment of low frequency noise complaints. The research included: \(i\) Laboratory tests addressing low frequency hearing threshold and acceptability; \(ii\) Field measurements that complemented interview\-based questionnaires **\[3.6\]**. Environmental health departments then tested the Salford procedure in trials with genuine low frequency noise complaints. 

 **E\) Multiscale porous materials** 

 Materials that have sorption, such as activated carbon, can provide extraordinary acoustic absorption and change compliances of cavities **\[3.7\]**. Umnova and Cox pioneered investigation into the acoustic behaviour of such materials. The theory of how sound propagates in multi\-scale materials was extended to account for physical processes specific to very small pores **\[3.7\]**. This allowed the sound interaction with such materials to be better understood. This research was supported by an EPSRC grant worth GBP147,000 **\[3\]**. These properties allow for devices \(e.g. air springs in vehicle suspensions\) that are smaller and lighter **\[3.8\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Impacts in the built environment come from better measurement and design tools to reduce noise and so improve environmental quality in the built environment **\(A, B, C\)**, better guidance for evaluating noise problems and so addressing health and wellbeing **\(D\)** and innovative materials to attenuate noise to improve environmental quality and reduce resource use to address sustainability **\(E\)**. 

 **A\)** **Structure\-borne sound** 

 This is of immense importance in vehicles, domestic products and buildings, because what users hear can be important to usability, brand value as well as health and wellbeing. Designers need to replace physical prototypes with computer models to speed prototyping and improve design. Salford’s blocked force method **\[3.1\]** was **adopted in ISO 20270:2019** and is considered to be a *‘game changer’* **\[5.1\]** because it allows sources to be independently characterised for computer models. This **enables prototyping of not\-yet\-existing products** and also allows the **proper specification of components**, solving contractual difficulties between suppliers and installers of components. 

 For these reasons, <ins>Siemens’</ins> <ins>Simcenter</ins> <ins>Testlab</ins> data acquisition and analysis software implements Salford’s blocked force method. They expect this to help **drive an increase in the Transfer Path Analysis \(TPA\) measurement market**, **\[text removed for publication\]** **\[5.2\]**. This then feeds into even bigger product markets that use the TPA measurement method. For example, **\[text removed for publication\]** confirms that **a major factor in being awarded a contract \[text removed for publication\]** was their *‘unique capability to perform all noise and vibration testing according to the in\-situ blocked force method’*, based on Salford’s research **\[5.3\]**. The method is used by many engineering companies whose products create noise that shapes the built environment soundscape, including <ins>Alstom, Bentley, Dyson, Volvo, General Motors and Scania</ins>. 

  

 **B\)** **Building envelope** 

 Better prediction models of sound insulation can speed up design work, reduce over\-design and save resources. Salford’s new prediction model **\[3.2\]** was funded by the <ins>Metal Cladding and Roofing Manufacturers Association \(MCRMA\)</ins>. The MCRMA members supply and manufacture approximately half of the GBP675,000 UK metal cladding and roofing market. **Approximately 80%** of the leading metal roll formers, **66%** of the leading rooflight manufacturers and **20%** of the leading independent roofing and cladding consultants nationally have been **trained to use Salford’s new prediction models** since 2014. After 2 years, **75% of them renewed the license** to continue using the product **\[5.4\]**. 

  

 **C\)** **Room acoustic diffusers** 

 These diffusers are used to improve speech intelligibility and the quality of musical sound. Salford’s research **\[3.3\]** **led to international measurement standard ISO 17497\-2** \(2012\), which continues to be the **standard method that underpins diffuser design and specification** in this census period **\[5.5, 5.6\]**. Salford’s research has led to diffuser designs that can be found in hundreds of rooms worldwide. Examples of completed high\-profile constructions from this census period include <ins>The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures, Apple, Google, Facebook, NY University, UCLA, Juilliard, MIT and Harvard</ins> **\[5.6\]**. 

  

 **D\) Low frequency noise** 

 This type of noise can affect health and wellbeing. Salford’s guidelines for assessment of low frequency noise have been **adopted as a standard approach for low frequency noise complaints by local authority environmental health officers** within the UK. The guidelines are also the method of choice for the <ins>Environment Agency</ins> **\[5.7\]**. Furthermore, they are **widely used in planning enquiries** via BS4142. BS4142 is used in all UK planning enquiries to address noise issues. The procedures in BS4142 exclude low frequency noise, instead deferring to Salford’s assessment method **\[5.7\]**. **The guidelines are also being adopted abroad**, for example for wind farm assessment in Ireland **\[5.8\]**. 

  

 **E\) Multi\-scale sorptive porous materials** 

 Salford’s research led to two patents **\[e.g. 3.8\]** and **formation of the spin\-out company** <ins>Carbon Air</ins> <ins>Ltd.</ins> in 2012, which has received multiple rounds of venture capital funding totalling GBP2,054,000 \(GBP 1,200,000 since 1 August 2013\) and now has 8 employees \(headcount: 8; FTEs: 6.5\) **\[5.9\]**. The company has filed a further **5 patent families** \(2014 – 2015\) since formation and **secured several licence contracts**, including with a specialist manufacturer of acoustic materials for buildings. **A 12\-year license agreement was also signed** with a <ins>German Tier 1 supplier</ins> to exploit the materials in transportation, as air springs in car suspensions **\[5.9, 5.10\]**. 

 **Over 100,000 carbon air springs** are now in Audi A6 and A6 Allroad cars. **All major automotive original equipment manufacturers** are trialling the technology. Production of novel air\-augmenting inserts for mountain bike forks began in 2019. Research to develop other novel microporous polymer materials for use in small\-scale audio applications is ongoing in collaboration with one of the world’s largest smartphone manufacturers **\[5.9\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Woods and McCormack have significantly improved the governance of international research into rare diseases \(RD\), which affect 400,000,000 people globally, to the benefit of patients and their families. They achieved this through bringing patients, clinicians and researchers together in novel governance bodies and improving the capacity of all involved to recognise the nuance and validity of each other’s perspectives. Patients’ voices would traditionally have been excluded from research governance before Woods’ and McCormack’s pioneering research. Changing this was especially important as their work engaged with some of the first patients to be involved in ‘big data’ research. Using a suite of qualitative methods and co\-production, they rendered significant benefits to the global population of RD patients by: \(1\) enabling and supporting patient representation in research governance, \(2\) developing patient\-informed governance procedures, and \(3\) improving international standards of care. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 Woods and McCormack are based in the Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre \(PEALS\) at Newcastle Sociology. PEALS is internationally recognised for its empirically informed socio\-ethical research on innovations in medical sciences. Their work has focused on patients with rare diseases \(RD\) that are often genetic in origin, which while individually rare, collectively affect 400,000,000 people globally. RD medical research is complex and intrusive, raising significant social and ethical challenges for patients and their families. The patient organisation Rare Disease Europe \( [EURORDIS](https://www.eurordis.org/publication/research-priorities-rare-diseases)\) in 2008 called for strategic co\-ordination of research policies and infrastructure in which patients should be accorded a greater role. Woods and McCormack have addressed these challenges through their contribution to major international research projects funded by the European Commission \(EC\). This case study focusses on two projects: TREAT\-NMD and RD\-Connect. 

 A key ambition for both projects was to unite the global diaspora of RD researchers in order to maximise the potential for better care and treatment for RD. Woods and McCormack were invited to lead research within the projects based on their knowledge of the socio\-ethical complexities of large\-scale medical research and their expertise in enabling patient involvement. 

 **TREAT\-NMD** \(2007\-present\) was initially funded as an EU Network of Excellence \(2007\-2012\), but continues now as the TREAT\-NMD Alliance. The Alliance continues to improve international research and clinical practice related to rare neuromuscular diseases. In the initial EU project Woods \(Co\-investigator and work\-package leader\) with McCormack \(Research Associate\) drew on theories of patient autonomy, activism and bio\-sociality to inform their research on patient representation. Their research identified that governance challenges in RD research included substantive issues around patient involvement, the sharing of sensitive data, and the participation of children in clinical research. Working collaboratively with Patient Organisations \(POs\) they established in 2008 a novel governance body: The Project Ethics Council \(PEC\) **\[PUB 1\]**. The PEC enabled clinicians and scientists to work alongside patient representatives in a collegiate and non\-hierarchical structure, which both informed the management of project\-related ethical issues and provided a site for Woods’ and McCormack’s ongoing research on the inclusion of patient representatives in research governance. This work became a virtuous circle for improving patient involvement and led clinical researchers to take seriously the knowledge and priorities of patients. Woods and McCormack were thus in the vanguard of participatory approaches to research governance. Four of the six research publications cited here were co\-produced with POs. 

 Historically, normative standards for the governance of medical research focused on non\-exploitation of patients. Woods’ and McCormack’s research with the PEC and with POs critically examined this consensus and identified a particular ‘activist’ element of the patient perspective that sought to influence the research agenda **\[PUB 2\]**. They also critiqued the ‘therapeutic misconception’, a concept in clinical trials which exists when a research participant falsely believes that the aim of the research is to provide beneficial treatment when the actual purpose is to determine whether there are any benefits at all. Woods and McCormack found that parents’ motivations when consenting for children to participate in a clinical trial were highly nuanced, and that they needed specific support including carefully presented information about the research. The role of POs in facilitating research was also explored and a potential for over\-promoting participation to parents was found **\[PUB 3\]**. 

 **RD\-Connect** \(2012\-present\) created a platform that continues to shape international research practice in the field of rare diseases by enabling the use of ‘big data’ through connecting databases, patient registries, biobanks and clinical bioinformatics internationally. Woods \(Co\-investigator\) and McCormack \(Senior Research Associate\) led work that examined the challenges of large\-scale sharing of sensitive clinical data and bio\-samples across international boundaries \(EC\-funded 2012\-2018\). They further developed and applied the novel methodology from TREAT\-NMD that allowed *research* on patient participation and *actual participation* to happen in concert, and for each to inform and reinforce the other in real time. This interwove \(i\) strategies for patient inclusion in research design and governance, \(ii\) deliberative conversations between RD patients, clinicians and scientists about how research infrastructures should be instituted and operated, and \(iii\) research, co\-produced with RD patients, about their lived experiences relevant to participation in RD research. This latter work involved some of the first patients to be involved in ‘big data’ research, making their research internationally significant **\[PUB 4\]**. Patients were found to be supportive of sharing their bio\-samples and personal data with multiple researchers if they were treated with respect and reciprocity. Further research focussed on issues around informed consent for data and bio\-sample sharing across multiple research projects and international boundaries **\[PUB 5\]**. This led to an International Charter of Principles for data sharing for genomics research which demonstrates that RD research can be both patient\-centred and sustainable **\[PUB 6\]**. 

 Woods’ and McCormack’s findings from their research in these projects revealed that patients had strong convictions on some of the central ethical issues in RD research, sometimes distinct from professionals, which they were able to articulate and defend **\[PUB 1,2, 4 and 5\]**. Patients could also contribute to research leading directly to improvements in care **\[PUB 6\]**. However, both patients and their representatives needed support in developing their capacity to contribute to research governance **\[PUB 3\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 **Woods’ and McCormack’s** research has changed and improved the practices of RD research governance globally, by ensuring the inclusion of patient representatives and their opinions. This has resulted from the careful development of an integrated community of patients, researchers and clinicians who now share a deep and nuanced understanding of each other’s perspectives on how RD research should progress. 

 *1. Patient representation in research governance* 

 The impact of Woods’ and McCormack’s research in TREAT\-NMD is evidenced in the inclusion of patient representatives in the governance structures of the continuing \(post\-2012\) TREAT\-NMD Alliance \(hereafter The Alliance\). The Alliance is made up of 258 organisations representing thousands of scientists, clinicians, and patient advocates from across the globe. The Alliance is supported by the TREAT\-NMD Project Ethics Council \(PEC\) established by Woods and McCormack in which 40% of members are patient advocates. The PEC is both responsive and proactive regarding ethical issues related to RD research. As the Chair of the Alliance comments: *‘It is currently more and more common practise to involve patient representatives in all aspects of therapy development. However, when Professor Woods and Dr McCormack initiated the PEC, this was not yet the case. Still, they always put the patients first, not only within PEC, but also within TREAT\-NMD and the projects that it spawned, ensuring the patient voice was heard during meetings’* **\[IMP 1\]**. 

 RD\-Connect was established to further improve RD research through international collaboration and data\-sharing. A PEC modelled on TREAT\-NMD was established in 2012, chaired by McCormack, with Woods as a member. The methodology used in TREAT\-NMD was further developed and a Patient Advisory Council \(PAC\) established \(2013\) in addition to the PEC, to support patient representatives, to develop capacity and to discuss issues in a safe space. As the project manager of RD\-Connect comments: ‘ *The legacy of this work is that these two bodies continue* *\(as of Sept 2020\)* *to advise 79 of the world’s leading RD laboratories and clinics and positively influence the working practices of their scientists and clinicians’* **\[IMP 2\]**. The transferability of this approach was demonstrated when the model of the patient inclusive PEC and PAC was adopted by two other EC\-funded research initiatives, EURenOmics \(rare renal diseases\) and NeurOmics \(rare neurological diseases\). The three projects formed a joint Rare Disease Patient and Ethics Council \(RD\-PEC 2013, chaired by McCormack 2013\-2018\), with a remit to cover 129 health, research, government, and industry organisations in 60 countries worldwide – advising clinicians and scientists and producing ethical opinions on a range of issues. An example of this work is **\[IMP 3\]**, where RD\-PEC coordinated a response with other relevant organisations to a 2014 Council of Europe \(CoE\) consultation on ‘research on biological materials of human origin’. The response, which would traditionally have come only from elite groups such as clinicians and bioethicists is all the more powerful for being jointly authored by patients, scientists and clinicians. It emphasised the importance of balancing individual citizen's rights to privacy and to benefit from medical research. A key statement in the response noted the importance to patients of their data being shared across different international research projects, a practice previously seen as ethically problematic by clinicians. 

 *2. Patient informed governance procedures* 

 Woods’ and McCormack’s findings on patients’ concerns about privacy, security and their ethical protection in research formed the basis of further guidelines and impacted on practises of RD\-Connect researchers. Patient concerns significantly informed the publication of an International Charter of Principles for data and bio\-sample sharing \(The Principles 2015\) and a guide to informed consent processes for international data sharing \(Consent Guide 2015\). These were developed following 12 interdisciplinary workshops jointly organised by Woods and McCormack between 2013 and 2018, involving over 300 patients, scientists and clinicians. The workshops equipped participants with the capacity to develop and implement their ideas in the light of a mutual, deep and nuanced understanding of all parties involved in RD research. 

 The Principles and Consent Guide were subsequently adopted via a peer\-review process \(in August 2015 and Sept 2016\), by the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium \(IRDiRC\) as Recognized Resources for researchers. The Chair of  [IRDiRC ](https://irdirc.org/)comments: ‘ *the label* \(Recognized Resource\) *was created to highlight key resources, that if used more broadly would accelerate the application of rare disease research into clinical care and treatment. The label is an assurance of quality and appropriateness’* **\[IMP 4\]**. The IRDiRC has 35 member organisations worldwide, consisting of patient organisations, research funders and biotech companies who have jointly committed to spending over GBP350,000,000 on RD research. The beneficiaries of the adoption of The Principles and Consent Guide include the patients whose data and bio\-samples are shared, and the scientists and clinicians working to improve diagnosis, treatment and care who can utilise these data within a patient\-centred framework. 

 The International Charter of Principles was translated in 2015 into a Code of Conduct \(revised 2018\) **\[IMP 5\]** which is a practical agreement providing methods and template documents to be used by researchers to enable ethical research. Written compliance with the Code of Conduct is now a condition of access to the RD\-Connect Platform and over 400 researchers have signed up, thereby committing to implementing its patient\-centred values in their work. 

 *3. Improving standards of care* 

 Woods’ research on enabling patient representation in TREAT\-NMD led directly to an invitation in 2016 to join international experts in revising the international standards of care \(SoC\) for the rare genetic disease spinal muscular atrophy \(SMA\). Woods led the working group on ethics and palliative care, drawing on Delphi methods to canvas patient opinion to ensure that patient views on ethical issues and concerns about palliative care were addressed in the SoC **\[IMP 6\]**. Published in 2017, the SoC is now *the* reference point for clinicians dealing with SMA patients, evidenced by more than 400 citations in clinical journals. Additionally, they have been widely adopted by POs. Woods also contributed to a patient\-friendly version in 2017 **\[IMP 7\]**. This version has been translated from English into four other languages and has been distributed by all the major international SMA patient organisations. As one PO states, the SoC serve ‘ *as resources for clinicians, in order to ultimately improve quality of care for individuals with SMA*’ \( [CureSMA](https://www.curesma.org/updated-2018-sma-standards-of-care-statements-available-online/)\) **\[IMP 7\]**, and another PO described it as ‘ *a major upgrade over what was available before*’ \( [TreatSMA](https://www.treatsma.uk/sma/standard-of-care/)\) **\[IMP 7\]**. 

 Woods’ and McCormack’s evidence\-based advocacy of patient involvement in RD research has also been used to ensure that RD contexts are considered in the development of policies and practises concerned with medical research involving children. For example, they were invited to provide evidence to the Nuffield Council on Bioethics \(NCoB\) working group \(2013\-15\) on the ethics of children’s participation in research. As the Director of NCoB says: *‘The report has been recognised as an important contribution to the field of paediatric research both in the UK and internationally… The ethical framework and practical recommendations made in the report are enabling regulators, funders and researchers to carry out good research with confidence’* **\[IMP 8\]**. The NCoB report and practice framework contain several references to Woods’ and McCormack’s research findings, and it has gone on to be widely cited and adopted. In the UK the  [Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/resources/professional-ethics-law-resources) has adopted the report as one of only five recommended sources of ethical guidelines for clinical researchers working with children, and the  [European Medicines Agency](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/presentation/presentation-nuffield-council-bioethics-report-children-clinical-research-ethical-issues_en.pdf) and a European  [network for paediatric research](https://www.teddynetwork.net/2019/09/27/the-nuffield-council-report-on-bioethics-is-focused-on-children-and-clinical-research-ethical-issues/) have highlighted the importance of the NCoB report **\[IMP 9\]**. This means that many thousands of children and their families experience improved ethical practice when participating in medical research. 

 **Woods and McCormack** have, in summary, made significant and lasting contributions to improving the international standards of ethical care of patients \(particularly children\) and their families who are involved in research into the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases. This was achieved by demonstrating the benefits of altering the governance of these activities to include patient voices and contributing significantly to the building of a research infrastructure in which patients and professionals share a deep understanding of each other’s perspectives and priorities.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Laurie Stras’s research has changed the public narrative of music history by uncovering new evidence of female music\-making, establishing a repertory of fifteenth\- and sixteenth\-century polyphony for female\-voice ensembles, identifying a new female composer, and proposing a new date for the earliest published compositions by a woman. Through practice\-based research with her ensembles, Musica Secreta and Celestial Sirens, and disseminating results through concerts, recordings, scores, and workshops, Stras has had a worldwide impact on public perception of historic women as musicians. Her research has encouraged amateur, institutional, and professional female groups in Australasia, Africa, South and North America, and Europe to participate in repertoire hitherto reserved for male\- and mixed\-voice ensembles. Her BBC Radio 3 *Composer of the Week* series \(quarterly listening figures 1.9m\) and award\-winning recording *Lucrezia Borgia’s Daughter* \(no. 2 in UK Classical Charts, and no 24 in US Billboard Classical charts\) are evidence of the profile of her impact. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The research underpinning the impact was all carried out by Laurie Stras: practice\-based research in collaboration with her ensembles Musica Secreta and Celestial Sirens. While there is a community of scholars working on early modern convents and convents music, Stras is only one to work directly as an editor, director, and performer as well as publishing in the top academic journals and presses. 

 The key insights/findings of the musicological research relate to convent music in sixteenth\-century Italy. They establish a female composer hitherto unknown to historians, Suor Leonora d’Este, daughter of Lucrezia Borgia and Duke Alfonso I of Ferrara; Stras asserts that she is the earliest published female composer \(1543\), although the pieces are published anonymously and authorship established only through analysis and detailed historical contextualisation \[ **3.3**, **3.4**, **3.6**\]. The contextual research for this central finding reveals new evidence of performance practice in 16th\-century Italian convents and a significant new body of works associated with convent performance, including complex polyphony and Sistine Chapel repertoire \[ **3.3**, **3.4**, **3.6**, **3.7**\], demonstrating further how convent music\-making was an important element of sixteenth\-century culture \[ **3.1**\- **3.4**\]. Revising previous narratives of an isolated flowering of female music making in late\-century courts, Stras shows that convent music\-making paved the way for secular women’s music\-making \[ **3.2**\]: moreover, techniques hypothesized by Stras in practice\-based research published in 2002 are proven to be valid by archival research done a decade later \[ **3.4**, **3.5**\]. 

 The research draws on a range of methodologies, including: archival research conducted 1996\-2017, in Ferrara, Mantua, Florence, Modena, and published in 2017/2018 \[ **3.1**\- **3.4**\]; interdisciplinary historical and literary contextual research, from primary and secondary sources, encompassing political, religious, social, and literary history \[ **3.1**\- **3.4**\]; music analysis – based on contemporaneous music theory, contextualisation in musical repertoire \[ **3.1**\- **3.4**\]; literary analysis – contextualisation in contemporary sources \(inc. liturgical, devotional\) \[ **3.1**\- **3.4**\]. The practice\-based research conducted with Musica Secreta \(2000\-2017\) involved a range of individual and collaborative \(“performance\-editing”\)  activities to understand how women, especially nuns, performed polyphony \[ **3.2**, **3.6**, **3.7**\]: transcription; editing by correcting clear errors, making decisions about ambiguous passages and text underlay, ornamentation planning or composition; rehearsal to consider issues of vocal timbre, balance, instrumentation, phrasing; revision of editions; rehearsal of some pieces with larger group, to test if decisions still hold; final performance.

 Tom Service, Guardian music critic and BBC broadcaster, introduced Stras as an academic and musician “whose work on the cultures of female composers of earlies centuries has given new life to repertoires that the patriarchies of posterity have otherwise forgotten,” *Music Matters*, 15 December 2018 \[ **5.1**\]. Stras’s primary findings – evidence of female composition, ownership, and performance of Renaissance sacred polyphony, and an extensive repertoire of works for equal voices made accessible through practice\-based research and dissemination – have permanently changed the public landscape of early music history and performance practice. Helen Wallace, artistic director of the central London venue, King’s Place, publicly acknowledged Stras’s input into her 2019 year\-long series of music by women composers, *Venus Unwrapped*, both at the opening reception and by tweeting, “I can never finish thanking you for your work, your inspiration and your quiet truthfulness. You do change the world” \(27 April 2019, after the King’s Place study day, “The Complete Guide to the History of Women Composers”\) \[ **5.7**\]. 

 The two strands of research and output, historical and practical, of Stras’s research have had separate but overlapping spheres of impact on a range of beneficiaries, individual and institutional. Impacts also range from personal benefit \(economic, social\) to broader social and cultural benefits as a result of new knowledge and perspective. Professional musicians have derived new and audience\-attractive programming with new performance demands, therefore developing new skills, and the music\-loving public have gained appreciation of insight and new knowledge through broadcast programmes. Economic benefit has derived to musicians \(concert fees, royalties, scores\); record companies \(CD sales\). Amateur singers have enjoyed the experience of participating in performance research, and feelings of well\-being and self\-esteem; other creatives. 

 The identification of Suor Leonora d’Este as the earliest published female composer has caught the imagination of public curators of cultural knowledge in the UK, Europe, USA, and Australia. Broadcast programmers have incorporated Musica Secreta’s recording into their playlists as well as formulating features on Suor Leonora for online and on\-air distribution \[ **5.1**\]. Printed and online media have commissioned articles on Stras and her work \[ **5.3**\]: notable among these are those appearing in popular religious media, reassessing the position of nuns in religious culture, including features by Michael White of the *New York Times* \(for the *Catholic Herald*: “The unwrapping \[referring to *Venus Unwrapped*\] that Stras has been engaged in is already quite remarkable.”\)  and Joanna Moorhead of the *Telegraph* \(for the *Tablet*: “time is running out for the chance to restore this ancient music to its original setting. And it really matters. … the talented nuns of old can have a powerful influence on the women musicians of today and on generations to come, reshaping their heritage for an affirmed and recognised future”\). 

 Professional and amateur musicians around the world have included d’Este’s compositions into their concert and recording repertoire \(the most high\-profile of these being the Monteverdi Choir and Stile Antico\) \[ **5.2**\]. Stras has made scores available from the Musica Secreta website, both free \(an assortment of scores prepared for Musica Secreta and Celestial Sirens – 583 downloads\) and for sale \(the performance editions for *Lucrezia Borgia’s Daughter –* 58 orders\) \[ **5.8**\]. These scores have been downloaded and purchased by amateur and professional choirs in North and South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and are beginning to be assimilated back into liturgical use, via the choirs of, e.g. St Paul’s Cathedral and Selwyn College, Cambridge \[ **5.2**\]. 

 The direct economic benefit of Stras’s research to other artists can be measured first by the annual turnover of Musica Secreta, which has risen from GBP5,000 in 2017/18 to GBP18,000 to date in 2019/20 \(income derived from sales of CDs and scores, grants, and performance fees\) \[ **5.8**\]. Musica Secreta is also now a Charitable Incorporated Association: the Charities Commission are convinced that the ensemble’s work creates a public benefit sufficient to warrant the financial benefits of charitable status \[ **5.9**\]. Sales of CDs and scores are classed as “primary trading,” in as much as they support the CIO’s charitable objects of “advanc\[ing\] education, for the public benefit, in the knowledge and appreciation of music primarily but not exclusively for female voices.” Direct economic benefit is also derived by Obsidian Records, who take a 90% share of worldwide sales and streaming royalties on CD717: to August 2018, sales include 1,444 physical and 450 downloaded albums, 5,322 downloaded tracks, and 120,062 streaming and digital broadcasts. 

 Stras’s research has continued to inspire other creatives \[ **5.4**\]: for example, scenes in Sarah Dunant’s 2017 novel *In the Name of the Family* \( *Times* Best Historical Fiction Book of the Year; *Cosmopolitan* Best Book of the Year; *History Today* Book of the Year\), about the Borgia family, are informed by the matter in the first chapter of Stras’s monograph \(2018\). Dunant gives Stras credit for helping her shape the cultural atmosphere of the Ferrarese court. Dunant and Musica Secreta collaborated in a presentation to commemorate the unveiling of a newly restored painting by a sixteenth\-century Florentine nun, Plautilla Nelli. The event was commissioned by the Advancing Women Artists Foundation and took place in the Museo di San Salvi in Florence, with approx. 250 invited guests, including the US Consul General. AWA also included a feature on Musica Secreta in its October 2018 magazine, which is distributed in hard copy and freely online to its followers worldwide \(11,000 on Facebook; 5,000 on Instagram\), and a report on the event in the April 2019 issue \(“accomplished musicianship… a satisfying complement to Nelli’s expressive art”\). 

 The importance of Stras’s research for the re\-imagining of early modern culture, from both aesthetic and religious standpoints, has been recognised by her participation in specialist and interdisciplinary fora, such as her series for BBC Radio 3’s *Composer of the Week* \(broadcast 2017; repeated 2018\); and BBC Radio 4’s *Start the Week* on faith and doubt \(Easter 2018\): The Radio 3 forum had high praise for the former \(“All a bit superlative this thread, but rightly so. I thought this week's CotW was absolutely brilliant, and I really loved the performances of all the music played;” “All five programmes have represented R3 \- and the BBC \- at its very considerable best.”  Social media reaction to the latter included, “That was one of the best STW I have heard in ages,” “\#StartTheWeek an absolute joy this morning. @amolrajanBBC presided over lovely natural conversation.” \[ **5.2**\] 

 The practical development and dissemination of Stras’s research through Musica Secreta and Celestial Sirens has been achieved through a collective effort that shows economic and emotional investment of participants and backers. Initially, practical research was undertaken with Arts Council England funding, which allowed for meticulous preparation and rehearsal, together with workshops for secondary\-school\-age participants in the Brighton Youth Choir, which culminated in a concert with all three groups in October 2015. The recording *Lucrezia Borgia’s Daughter* was partially financed through a crowdfunding appeal, which attracted over 100 backers in the six weeks before Christmas 2015, raising more than GBP4,000. The project attracted further funding from the Ambache Charitable Trust, which supports performance and recording of music by female composers, and the Noah Greenberg Award from the American Musicological Society, which honours excellence in projects that bring together musicologists and performers. The recording in 2016 took place in a convent chapel, with both professional and amateur musicians, ages ranging from 18 \(recruited from the Brighton Youth Choir\) to 67. A survey after the recording asked participants about their involvement, what impact they felt the project had had on them, and what impact they felt it would have on audiences \[ **5.5**\]. One responded, “I have a moderate hearing loss which started in my 30s and I remember well getting back to singing in a choir in 2004 not knowing if I would be capable of doing it with hearing aids. Therefore, taking part in projects like this where I am singing such wonderful polyphony with skilled singers is very special for me personally.” Another said, “Nothing has been heard like this before. It will divide \[audiences\], I think, but that is all for the good as it will make them think. And it will stay with them forever.” 

 The recording was reviewed widely in the UK, Europe, USA, and Australia, and garnered many plaudits from both general and specialist publications \(“Stras explains that they adopted approaches that reflect the realities of convent performance…This variety not only makes musical/historical sense, but it enhances and enriches the listening experience…Highly recommended”; *Classics Today*\). It was also widely shared on social media, particularly the *Guardian* blog, which was shared over 23,000 times directly from the *Guardian* website. It was in the Official Classical Charts Top 20 for over six weeks \(highest position, No. 2\), and reached No. 24 on the Billboard Classical Charts in the USA; it also received a Gramophone Critic’s Choice award for 2017 \[ **5.6**\]. 

 Stras has also disseminated her research through concerts, workshops and courses for female singers/musicians in the UK and Europe, with participants from North America, UK, Europe, and Australasia \[ **5.7**\]. All workshops included an informal lecture from Stras as well as musical coaching. Workshops typically had an attendance of 12 to 24 singers, and were held over a weekend or a full week. Participants had the opportunity to engage with both the process and outcomes of research: in 2017, singers on a week\-long course in Triora \(Italy\) worked through the first stages of performance\-editing an anonymous mass from a 16<sup>th</sup>\-century convent manuscript; on a weekend course in Cambridge 2019, participants experimented with singing around a choirbook stand. 100% of feedback responses said they would attend another workshop; free form responses include appreciation for the scholarly historical context, “Thanks so much for opening our eyes to the cultural/emotional background to this wonderful music,” the active research element, “It was wonderful to be a 'lab rat' and to learn so much new music as well as so much about its context and its technical importance”; and express the continued need for this type of event, “Women outnumber men in almost every mixed choir but there are few opportunities for them to perform polyphony … together in women only groups. More opportunities please\!” 

 Postgraduate bursaries allowed four young North American women to attend the 2019 course in Triora, two of whom direct their own female\-voice ensembles, Sub Rosa \(Toronto\) and the Korrigan Consort \(Oxford\). The mentorship they received has resulted in a collaboration between the two directors, the first iteration of which will take the Korrigan Consort to the Tolosa Choral Contest in northern Spain in November 2019. The Korrigan Consort are also sponsoring the composition of an opera based on stories found in Stras’s monograph.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Angela Colvert’s research has developed influential new models of hybrid\-literacies, ludic authorship and immersive play, informing the ways in which the digital literacy practices of young children are supported and evaluated in a range of educational settings. This research has had significant impact on international teaching practices in Early Years settings, in particular through: 

1.  Informing the design and evaluation of digital games, including the Teach Your Monster to Read series, in order to improve literacies in early years, reaching approximately 20 million children across the globe; 

1.  Informing and influencing the policy and strategy of public bodies, governmental campaigns and educational associations; 

1.  Influencing the practice, strategies and creative collaborations of UK\-based immersive theatre companies. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Rapid developments in children’s digitally\-mediated play and the slow pace of innovation in curriculum design have led to an increasing disparity between the literacy practices many children engage in outside of the classroom and the literacy experiences they encounter in print\-based school contexts. Despite the clear need to innovate in this area, work has been hindered as educators have not had access to theoretical and pedagogical frameworks which are nuanced and flexible enough to support their investigations and practices. Colvert’s research addressed this issue through the development of new models of literacies which uniquely serve both as theoretical frameworks and pedagogical tools \( **R1**, **R2, R3**\). Colvert’s models provide innovative pedagogical approaches to the teaching of new literacies in formal education through play and present fresh conceptualisations of transmedia authorship practices and associated literacies. 

 Colvert has investigated and theorised the pedagogical potential of peer\-to\-peer authorship of Alternate Reality Games \(ARGs\) in a primary classroom, and it was from this research that her models of literacies emerged \( **R1, R2, R3**\). Colvert’s hybrid model of literacies foregrounds the interconnectedness of the three dimensions of a child’s literacies \(technical skills, cultural understandings and critical awareness\), as they engage in the process of communication. Historically, literacy research and educational policy have often focused on one dimension of literacies \(skills\) which is assessed at one stage of the process \(the production of a written outcome\). Colvert’s three\-dimensional conceptualisation of literacies as a *dynamic process* provides a valuable alternative to such static views of literacy. The research suggests that in order to develop and understand children’s literacy practices, every stage of the process needs to be brought into focus, including the design, production, dissemination and interpretation of messages. Communication, as presented in Colvert’s model, focuses on both the creation and the reception of texts – writing and reading across a range of media. 

 Colvert’s concept of ludic authorship extends the hybrid model by adding an additional layer related specifically to the process of game design and play. This model is unique as it is rooted in the concerns expressed by thirty 10\- and 11\-year\-old game designers who, in a series of interviews, highlighted the importance of shaping fictionality, authenticity and agency. Colvert mapped these three concerns to the three dimensions of literacies: skills \(shaping the fictional context of play\); cultural understandings \(maintaining authenticity by drawing on a range of game and narrative conventions\); critical awareness \(negotiating the power dynamics between players and designers\). Ludic authorship subsequently informed the development of a model of immersive play which was grounded in the analysis of interviews with artists, game\-designers, teachers and children during a five\-week immersive gaming project across three schools. This model of immersive play is the first to map the relationship between ‘affect’ and ‘effect’ during the process of play. 

 Colvert’s models reframe traditional concepts of literacies – constituting an original and substantial contribution to the field of education. They reconsider play as a literacy practice and explicitly highlight the skills, knowledge, and understandings that are needed to engage in the new literacy practices associated with game design. They can also be used as a lens through which educators may critically examine the purpose and structure of the texts children produce as they engage in digital play. Colvert’s models enable educators to incorporate new literacy practices into the classroom so that young people may be supported to become powerful participants in the contemporary communicational landscape. Her research provides vital evidence of the ways that digital literacies can be developed inside and outside of the classroom, extending the opportunities for teaching and learning in the twenty\-first century. Colvert’s models have been adapted by the education technology industry, makerspaces and immersive theatre companies. 

 In 2019, Colvert was awarded a grant from the British Academy to develop the hybrid model of literacies with teachers through the co\-design of ARGs across schools in Lambeth \( **G1**\). In this project, she is working with six teachers across three schools to set up makerspaces in their classrooms as they explore ‘theory in practice’. The first stage of this new research led to the development of an innovative assessment tool which was subsequently published by the UK Literacy Association.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Colvert’s research and impact has been developed in praxis during her time at the University of Roehampton. Through her work and research into literacy and gaming, Colvert has established herself as a leading authority on gaming and literacy who combines expertise in digital game\-design, curriculum implementation and the development of transmedia resources in collaboration with a variety of stakeholders \( **R1, R2, R3**\). 

1.  **Informing the design and evaluation of digital games, in order to improve literacies in early years** 

 One key collaboration has been with the Usborne Foundation. Colvert has worked as part of a small creative team – Teach Monster Games – to develop a series of three games to support children in the early stages of reading. During this process, Colvert’s research into developing literacies through play informed the design and structure of the games and shaped the methodological approaches to user testing \( **R1**, **R2, R3**\). The development of the games underwent the 'staged\-process' that Colvert defines in her research, and she was directly involved in each of those stages. During the design stage, Colvert’s research was instrumental in shaping the early concepts for the imagined worlds and the missions that children would undertake. In the production stage, Colvert frequently reviewed prototypes, defined the educational content and suggested new approaches and adaptations. In the dissemination stage, she supported the planning of approaches to promotion and drafted marketing materials for schools and parents, helping the company understand how the game could be integrated into school literacy practices and reach more children. During the interpretation phase, Colvert contributed to the analyses of the data collected from users, and applied her research insights, to inform the future educational priorities of the next stage of game\-design. The development of each stage of game\-design process was influenced by Colvert’s research into the three dimensions of literacies. The Head of Teach Monster Games confirmed ‘that the game was aligned with the cultural practices in schools and home relating to literacies and play’. He recognised this as ‘vital for our product’. According to him, Colvert’s ‘research has transformed the team’s understanding of the process by which children learn to read and throughout the process of creating the reading products she has consistently ensured that the gaming pedagogies were developed to support children’s learning effectively’ \( **IMP1**\). The three games that resulted from this collaboration – *First Steps* \(2012\), *Fun with Words* \(2013\) and *Champion Reader* \(2015\) – are collectively known as *Teach Your Monster to Read* \(TYMTR\). 

 Between July 2013 and December 2020, the games have reached over 27,000,000 individual players in both home and school settings around the world, but most prominently in the USA, UK, Canada and Australia, and have been played a total 264,815,029 times. In February 2020, the Department for Education recommended parents use TYMTR to help pre\-school children learn at home. With the mandatory school\-closures in the UK due to the COVID\-19 pandemic, the games helped over 2.6 million children learn to read at home in March 2020 alone. TYMTR was number 11 in Apple’s top paid apps of 2018 and was listed as the no.1 kids’ app in the Apple app store in both the UK and USA. In 2019, it was listed in the top 10 most popular iPad apps \(across all categories\) \( **IMP2**\). 

 TYMTR has generated a huge amount of user feedback which indicates its significant impact on children’s literacy. Feedback from teachers and parents – comprised of thousands of testimonials and reviews – shows how the games have significantly improved the engagement and reading skills of children, particularly in the USA and UK, both at home and in school settings. Comments made available at the GooglePlay store – where TYMTR has an overall rating of 4.4 stars out of 5 based on the assessment made by over 2,600 users – indicate the key role the games have had in the development of children’s reading skills. One teacher noted that she ‘started using this in my class and even my low ability readers have greatly improved…My entire department had adopted the program.’ \( **IMP2**\). The majority of the comments focus on describing how much children enjoy TYMTR and how it supported children to become able to read above the expected level for their age. Among thousands of comments, one parent \(Lou\) noted that ‘This game enabled my child to read Roald Dahl novels before turning 5 years old. We were amazed at how much enjoyment and engagement was had from this game. It teaches all phonics sounds, segmenting and blending’. 

 User feedback also evidences how engaging TYMTR is \( **R1**, **R2**\), which has been highlighted as a key factor in the continuous development of children’s skills and a positive attribute of the game when compared against other literacy apps in the market. One user \(Shel Martin\) noted that this is ‘the best game I have come across for teaching phonics. The progression makes sense and highly recommend to any child at any stage of their phonics journey’ \( **IMP2**\). One of the most detailed accounts of the impact of TYMTR on the reading skills of children was made by one parent who has used the apps to teach five children: ‘As a home edder to 5 children this is one of THE best apps available on the market.  The role play factor helps to keep them interested beyond the usual 15mins concentration lull suffered by other learning apps \[…\] My middle child is severely Dyslexic and has struggled with hearing the sounds and then making the connection, and yet he has finally started to understand them. This is after only a few weeks of using this programme exclusively’ \( **IMP2**\). 

1.  **Improving teaching practices in Early Years settings through influence on policy and strategy of public bodies and educational associations** 

 Following her involvement in the development of TYMTR, Colvert was invited to participate in the consultation process of the 2019 Government’s ‘Home Learning Environment Early Years Apps Pilot’. Through engaging in this process, Colvert’s research into digital literacies contributed to the development of the educational criteria used to assess the quality of apps, with the aim of providing guidance to parents on which apps best support children’s literacies in the Early Years \( **IMP3**\). This government initiative resulted in a selection of the highest quality apps, including TYMTR, being awarded a quality mark and recommended to families and schools as part of the government's Hungry Little Minds campaign, launched in July 2019 \(<ins>https://hungrylittleminds.campaign.gov.uk</ins>\). This three\-year campaign aims to help parents understand the potential of apps to influence their child’s learning capacity and that reading, playing and chatting can aid their development. This is one of the main governmental initiatives to provide better early\-years education, promoting the development of young children through empowering parents and providing them with tools to support the learning process at home. Through the establishment of a quality standard for apps, parents across the UK now have access to accredited, trustworthy tools to support their young children’s development. 

 In addition to influencing the policy on digital play in the UK, Colvert’s research is also informing the UK Literacy Association’s \(UKLA\) work on digital literacies. In their position statement on the subject, which cites Colvert’s work \( **R1**\), the UKLA recognised that literacies in everyday life are rapidly diversifying, providing increased opportunities for children to engage with digital materials \( **IMP4**\). Alongside her colleagues from the UKLA’s Digital Literacies Task Group, and building on her research and its key principles \( **R1**\), Colvert developed a new Digital Literacies Framework. During 2020, the draft of this framework was tested in a pilot exercise with teachers, creating a series of case\-studies which reflected the range of ways in which the framework influenced their practice. The framework will be the key resource to support the UKLA’s efforts as they push for policy change and the integration of digital literacies in educational practice in the UK \( **IMP5**\). 

1.  **Influencing the change of practices, strategies and creative collaborations of UK\-based immersive theatre companies** 

 Colvert’s research has been crucial in the re\-thinking of the practices and strategies of the British immersive theatre companies Punchdrunk Enrichment and Kit Theatre. Since 2015, Colvert has been working with Punchdrunk Enrichment to support the development of their educational and creative partnership work in schools. The company was embarking on new immersive theatre productions in school settings and wanted to understand the educational impact of integrating gaming into their work. Colvert undertook two research projects funded by the theatre company, summarised in the project reports: Prospero’s Island: An Evaluation \(2016\) and The Oracles: Mapping the Affects and Effects of Immersive Play in KS2 \(2018\) \( **IMP6**\). The latter project was the first time that Punchdrunk incorporated digital gaming, in the form of a virtual world, into the theatrical experience \( **IMP7**\). Adapting and drawing on her conceptualisation of ‘literacy as process’ \( **R1, R2**\), Colvert developed a new model of immersive play for Punchdrunk to help them better articulate the educational values and principles that underpin their work with schools and communities. This model mapped the relationships between affect \(intensity\) and effect \(engagement\) during their five\-week gaming project in three primary school classrooms and is now being integrated into the company’s core outreach work with teachers. The Director of Punchdrunk Enrichment described the findings as an ‘epiphany moment’ for the company, resulting in the transformation of the way they conceptualise and evaluate the impact of their work, particularly in schools \( **IMP7**\). The Director explained ‘Previously our evaluations focused on academic attainment but we now have a way of understanding and valuing the process. Our work embodies imaginative and immersive play and we now have a tool to support us to explore that \- the value of that process of play \- rather than focusing solely on outputs’ \( **IMP7**\). 

 Subsequently Punchdrunk invited Colvert to collaborate on the development of the ‘Punchdrunk Learning Collective’, a teacher network with seventeen schools across Haringey and Woolwich. Drawing on her model of ludic authorship \( **R2**\) \(which frames game design as a dynamic process of design, production, interpretation and dissemination\) Colvert proposed framing the three\-year workshop structure to systematically support teachers in developing their understanding of and engagement with immersive play over an extended period. Colvert’s model of immersive play was integrated into the first of their teacher training sessions and underpins the structure of their teacher workshops and network meetings \( **IMP7**\). It has been used to explore how immersive play can shape a child’s affective sense of purpose, place, urgency and community and lead to a range of beneficial educational outcomes and effects. To date approximately 400 teachers and 12,000 children have benefitted from Colvert’s research through their participation in the network, and they have actively engaged with the work of the Punchdrunk Learning Collective and begun to develop their immersive play in their classrooms. 

 Between January and July 2019, Colvert collaborated with KIT Theatre as the co\-director and producer of a new immersive game designed to develop children’s digital literacy practices through playful dramatic engagement with online and offline challenges and quests \(www.dots.team\). This game integrated Colvert’s pedagogical approach to alternate reality game design \( **R1**, **R2**, **R3**\) and included challenges specifically designed to develop children’s digital literacies and associated teacher planning tools. This collaborative project was the first time that KIT theatre developed a production to support digital literacies in this way. On the influence of Colvert’s research, KIT’s director stated that ‘we have been able to demonstrate and articulate the educational potential of our work and there is no doubt that our partnership with Dr Colvert and the University of Roehampton has been a contributing factor in helping us secure funding for our company from the Arts Council. Her research had a significant impact on my work and practice’ \( **IMP8**\).

###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Bridges Self\-Management approach has grown from research led by Professor Fiona Jones at Kingston University’s Centre for Applied Health and Social Care Research since 2008. Initially the approach focussed on self\-management in stroke patients, supporting their acquisition of the knowledge and the confidence needed to understand and manage their conditions. More recently, research has focussed on extending the approach to other conditions and healthcare settings. 

 Prof Jones’ research, supported by external grants gained in this new REF period from NIHR and the Health Foundation, has demonstrated the feasibility of integrating Bridges into the practice of acute and community healthcare teams. It has also shown that practitioners’ behaviour changes as a result, leading to more collaborative and person\-centred interactions with patients. Research has focused primarily on evaluations of Bridges with practitioners in healthcare settings across the NHS in the UK, but research carried out in Otago and Flinders Universities support cultural applicability in New Zealand and Australia. 

 This work has underpinned efforts to scale and spread the Bridges approach across healthcare. It has offered new ways to reach practitioners, and a new evidence base to support these efforts. Her research has: 

1.  demonstrated that a person\-centred approach to self\-management, where healthcare professionals approach each individual patient holistically, does not necessarily take more time than other approaches, and can deliver efficiencies and improved outcomes **\[R1, R2\]**. 

1.  demonstrated that healthcare practitioners can gain confidence, change their beliefs and behaviour, and integrate self\-management support into their usual ways of working **\[R3, R4, R5\]** 

1.  informed new models of training, able to reach larger numbers of interdisciplinary groups, e.g. workers in acute healthcare settings such as stroke units **\[R4, R5\]**. 

1.  Increased the accessibility of self\-management support to patients with complex needs, usually excluded from self\-management programmes such as those with brain injury \(who may have memory problems\) major trauma patients \(that may require lengthy hospitalisation\) and patients with multiple conditions \(such as stroke and dementia\) **\[R3, R4, R5\]**. 

1.  provided insight into the co\-production of self\-management resources with patients **\[R5\]**. 

1.  advanced understanding of how culture and context can vary when the Bridges approach is applied in different countries such as Australia **\[R6\]**. 

 As a consequence of research in traumatic brain injury, the ‘Building Bridges after Brain Injury’ programme was launched and evaluated in an acute neuroscience centre in London. Outputs described how Bridges could be adapted for this patient group and staff reported tangible changes in their practice **\[R5\]**. Staff attitudes and confidence to support self\-management changed after Bridges training. This resulted in new methods of healthcare delivery and in interactions which put patients’ needs and ideas central to their care **\[R3, R4, R5\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Development of the Bridges self\-management programme began in 2008. Initially focussed on stroke patients, Bridges is now used with thousands of patients living with brain injury, progressive neuromuscular conditions, multiple co\-morbidities, major trauma, chronic pain, rheumatoid conditions, cancer, childhood conditions and learning disabilities, impacting on their confidence to self\-manage and reducing reliance on specialist services **\[S1\]**.  The research has had an economic impact, in the form of the social enterprise founded to promote the programme; it has had an impact on healthcare practitioners as they have adopted the programme; and it has had an impact on the delivery of services and on the wellbeing of patients. 

1.  **Commercial Impact** 

 The spinout social enterprise Bridges Self\-Management Ltd \(Company number **08590348\)** 

 was launched in December 2013 as a vehicle for implementation, uptake and advancement of Bridges. Kingston University is a shareholder in Bridges and supports Jones’s secondment enabling synergies between the university and social enterprise sector. Bridges Self\-Management Ltd now employs a team of managers and developers \(headcount: 5, FTEs: 3.6\) including 2 staff members registered as disabled, and 14 Associate Trainers \(11 more than in the last REF period. As of 2018/19, the company had an annual turnover of GBP592,002, compared to GBP87,000 in 2014/15. Since its inception in 2013, Bridges Self\-Management Ltd has attracted grant funding totalling more than GBP1,500,000 to develop and spread its programme to new patient groups, and to evaluate its implementation in different clinical settings. In November 2020 Bridges Self\-Management was one of the first organisations delivering consultancy and training in personalised care to be accredited by the Personalised Care Institute set up by NHS England and Improvement in 2020 **\[S2\]**. 

 The expansion of the business has enabled the production of new self\-management book and online resources for patients **\[S3\]**. These have been co\-produced with people living with a range of conditions, assisting clinicians in their interventions with patients, but also acting as a patient/or family\-held resource for support and education. Since 2014, 6 new self\-management booklets and 2 digital tools \(app and website\) have been developed for people \(and their families\) with stroke, progressive neuromuscular disease, major trauma, traumatic brain injury, dementia, Parkinson’s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis. The stroke self\-management book has been revised to improve accessibility for people with communication problems and has been translated into Welsh. Since 2014, approximately 7,350 booklets have been directly distributed by Bridges Self\-Management Ltd, and more than 20,000 provided through training packages commissioned by healthcare teams. These tools have impacted on the patient and carer experience; by reading about how others cope, patients and their families can learn more about how they can improve or at least manage their condition **\[S4\]**. 

1.  **Impact on practitioners** 

 As of December 2020, Bridges Self\-Management Ltd had delivered training and consultancy to 380 healthcare teams from acute hospitals, rehabilitation units and community \(rehabilitation, social care, voluntary and charity sector\), reaching more than 4000 practitioners from across all healthcare disciplines. Training and consultancy have been delivered in the UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, Estonia, Sweden, Belgium. Jones has presented and disseminated Bridges at multiple national and international forums, and Bridges is used as a key component in interventions for research programmes led by other collaborators **\[S5\]**. 

 When training was paused at the start of the pandemic in March 2020, Bridges provided free webinars on a range of topics which were accessed live or through a new YouTube channel by more than 3200 healthcare practitioners from across the world. Surveys showed that the webinars offered a safe place to reflect on self\-management, resilience, and person\-centred practice at a time of reactive and challenging healthcare **\[S6\]**. 

 UK health policy promotes self\-management, and Bridges meets this need by providing an evidence\-base and methodology for practitioners to understand the significance and benefits of self\-management support. Practitioners learnt, through Bridges, tangible methods to integrate self\-management strategies into existing everyday practice, and recognise this can reduce rather than add to their workload **\[S7\]**. This change is achieved through modifying language and communication during interactions with patients: 92% of practitioners state that Bridges has helped them build better relationships with patients and their families and has made them more able to support patients to achieve meaningful outcomes **\[S7\]**. 

1.  **Impact on service delivery** 

 Since 2014, Bridges has moved from workshop delivery to include larger quality improvement projects, for example: 

1.  **Wales.** In 2016 Bridges Self\-Management Ltd worked with 86 practitioners from stroke teams across acute and community pathways, in 3 out of 7 health boards. Due to the success of this project, further funding was received in 2017 to train an additional 158 stroke staff, covering all 7 health boards. The establishment and training of 30 Bridges Champions in these areas has helped focus training and ensure sustainability, with further funding secured for the next year **\[S8\]**. 

1.  **Northern Ireland.** In 2017 Bridges Self\-Management Ltd was commissioned by the Southern Health and Social Trust in Northern Ireland, to complete a project adapting the Bridges training and approach for use with Paediatric services. This initial project involved 25 clinicians **\[S9\]**. However, due to the success of this initial project, Bridges self\-management was adopted by Children and Young People services across the whole of Northern Ireland **\[S10\]**. 

1.  **East of England.** In 2018, Bridges Self\-Management Limited delivered a large multi\-area project “People 1<sup>st</sup>” funded by Health Education England. This project includes all stroke and neurological service teams across six sustainability and transformation partnerships \(STPs\), involving 650 staff from 24 trusts. 80 project champions have attended six masterclasses across the East of England region and are now expanding the reach of self\-management support within their services. Independent evaluation by the University of East Anglia shows tangible changes in the way in which patients with complex and multiple long\-term conditions are supported to self\-manage. These changes have resulted in numerous efficiencies within teams and services, including increased confidence among staff to enable them to support self\-management **\[S7\]**. 

 As a result of projects like these, multiple healthcare teams and pathways of care have adopted new efficient working processes and systems after integrating Bridges into their delivery. Bridges transformed care pathways within a Northern Ireland paediatric service resulting in waiting times decreasing from 3 months to 1 month **\[S9\]**. 

 In wider recognition of the value of Bridges in promoting patient self\-management, Jones was awarded an MBE in recognition of her services to stroke rehabilitation in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List 2017.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Hohl’s research has had deep reach in police forces in Great Britain, directly informing police understanding of sexual and domestic violence; changing police training, procedures, and resource allocation; and benefiting victim\-survivors of sexual or domestic violence. Specifically, Hohl and Co\-Investigators used their research findings to: \(1\) develop new, evidence\-based training for police officers who investigate rape and sexual assault, in coproduction with \[text removed for publication\] and \[text removed for publication\]; \(2\) prompt \[text removed for publication\] to pioneer Hohl’s proposal of an innovative anonymous reporting route specifically designed for sexual violence victim\-survivors, improving their access to criminal justice; \(3\) shape changes to the risk assessment police officers in England and Wales complete at domestic incidents, directly benefitting victim\-survivors and preventing further harm, including homicide. Most recently, Hohl and Johnson’s research on domestic abuse during Covid\-19 informed police force decision\-making nationally and increased resource allocation to domestic abuse within \[text removed for publication\]. Internationally, Hohl’s research is being used to inform rape law reform processes in Japan and Australia. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **2.1 The ‘attrition problem’ in relation to rape convictions \(2012\-2015\)** 

 Hohl’s research provides a robust empirical evidence base that has changed how some police forces understand and respond to the rape ‘attrition problem’, the fact that less than 1% of rapes reported to police result in a conviction \(ONS, 2020\). The research produced first\-of\-its\-kind robust empirical evidence through statistical analysis of a representative sample of rape complaints made to Europe’s largest police force, the Metropolitan Police Service \(MPS\). This research was a collaboration with Professor Elizabeth \(Betsy\) Stanko, OBE, who at the time was Head of the Strategy, Analysis and Research with the MPS. 

 The research involved a statistical analysis of 587 police case files of all rape allegations made to the MPS during April and May 2012, with the results giving unique insights into the factors that influence attrition. The research evidenced the continued influence of rape myths and stereotypes, that officers noting inconsistencies in the victim’s account would almost always lead to the case being discontinued, and identified the role of victim vulnerabilities and victim disengagement in case attrition **\[3.1\]**. Hohl and colleagues have used these findings to develop new police training in collaboration with two forces. Further, to address victim disengagement, Hohl proposed the introduction of confidential online reporting to give victim\-survivors agency and the choice to report online rather than in person, providing their account in their own words \(free recall\), in their own time from any place that feels safe and comfortable to them. It also gives them choice to opt in or out of participating in the subsequent police investigation, addressing a common reason of victim withdrawal **\[3.2\]**. This approach is now being implemented by \[text removed for publication\]. 

 **2.2 Human memory, attrition, and rape victim interviews \(2014\-2015\)** 

 A separate and further analysis of the MPS rape case files dataset was used to explore how human memory impacts rape case attrition. The results showed how normal features of human memory are at odds with criminal justice demands on victim recall of the alleged crime, and provided evidence in support of the hypothesis that inconsistencies in the victim account increase the odds of attrition. This is important because in complaints of rape the victim’s memory is frequently the only and nearly always the central piece of evidence of the alleged rape. The implications are that police interview techniques must be made more compatible with science\-based models of human memory **\[3.3\]**. These findings have been used to change police training in collaboration with two police forces, and to inform rape law reform proposals in the Australian Capital Territory. 

 **2.3 Developing more effective police training for investigating rape cases \(2015\-2017\)** Building on her research **\[3.1, 3.3\]** Hohl secured a HEFCE/Home Office Police Knowledge Fund Grant in 2015 to study current police training and officer understanding of rape victim engagement, the attrition problem, and to develop new training based on these findings in collaboration with the MPS and Sussex Constabulary. Hohl conducted semi\-structured interviews with a representative, stratified sample of police officers. Key findings were the conflicting needs of the police investigation and the victim, as well as a lack of preparation and guidance for officers in how to meet both. Hohl also observed police training on sexual offences at the MPS and identified inadequacies in the content, delivery, and context which contributed to the research finding that the training was ineffective in changing officer attitudes and practice. From analysing police training and officer perceptions Hohl used the research to develop a new training package to bring about change in how officers engage with rape victims **\[3.4\]**. 

  

 **2.4 Domestic abuse risk assessment \(2015\-2017\)** 

 The aim of this research was to provide the first robust statistical analysis of which risk factors were most helpful in identifying high risk domestic abuse cases. Hohl used innovative latent trait modelling to analyse the risk assessment tool, which officers in England and Wales must complete at every domestic incident they attend. The risk assessment is crucial in triggering safeguarding to preventing further harm, including homicide. The results showed that indicators of coercive control better identify ‘high risk’ cases than factors associated with physical violence alone. Based on the results, Hohl and her then PhD student Myhill recommended shortening and sharpening of the DASH \(Domestic Abuse, Stalking and Harassment\) tool, with a smaller, more powerful set of indicators focussed on coercive control **\[3.5\]**. The findings were incorporated into a revised DASH form by the College of Policing, the national guidance and training body for the police service. 

 **2.5  Domestic abuse during the Covid\-19 pandemic \(2020\)** 

 From June 2020, Hohl together with Johnson, Durham University, have investigated the impact of Covid\-19 lockdowns on domestic abuse reported to police. The research analysed all domestic abuse\-flagged incidents and crimes reported to seven police forces across England since the onset of the pandemic. Data was compared to those of the two previous years, to account for seasonal and long\-term trends, and then mapped onto the introduction and lifting of national and local Covid\-19 restrictions. In addition, police officers were regularly interviewed about responding to domestic abuse in the changing context of the pandemic and the findings triangulated with those of the statistical analyses. Preliminary findings showed how in most police forces in the study the increase in domestic abuse volume during 2020 was due to long term trends rather than lockdown; that lockdown impacted differently on different types of relationships; and, that full lockdowns kept victims in abusive relationships for longer, with separations delayed until restrictions were eased **\[3.6\]**. The results have changed police understanding nationally and in \[text removed for publication\] have been used to justify an increased allocation of resources to domestic abuse.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **4.1 Improving police response to sexual violence: Overview of the research impact** 

 Hohl’s research **\[3.1\-3.6\]** has had deep reach within police forces nationally, including \[text removed for publication\]. The resulting changes in knowledge and understanding, training, victim reporting routes, procedures and resource allocation within those police forces have had wider reverberations, resulting in numerous citations of the research in government reports, such as the Home Affairs Select Committee. Hohl’s expertise has led to roles on advisory and strategic management boards, as well as national and international engagement with policy and decision makers. The police are the gatekeepers to criminal justice and, for the 99% of victim\-survivors of sexual violence and 92% of victim\-survivors of domestic violence who do not see their case go to court \(ONS, 2020\), the police investigation remains the defining experience of the criminal justice system. Rape is an iconic offence in the measure of women’s equality in society. How complaints of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence are treated by police is not only important for the victims who seek justice but sends a powerful signal to society at large. The following sections 4.2 to 4.6 outline the specific ways in which Hohl’s research has resulted in significant changes of police training, procedures and understanding with regard to engagement with victim\-survivors of sexual and/or domestic violence. 

 **4.2 Changing police training in the MPS** 

 Hohl and colleagues, in collaboration with the MPS and Sussex Constabulary used the findings of their attrition and police training research **\[3.1, 3.3, 3.4\]** to develop a new training package for police officers involved in investigating rape and sexual offences **\[5.1\]**. This training package is now embedded into the routine, mandatory training at \[text removed for publication\]. \[text removed for publication\] have indicated to Hohl that, since 2017, every new sexual offence investigation officer in the \[text removed for publication\] must successfully complete the training module \(e.g. over 140 officers in 2017, over 70 officers in 2018\). \[text removed for publication\], said that as a result of this new training police officer interviewing of sexual offence victims is: “ *of a higher standard than previously seen, and the level of confidence and positive attitudes \[...\] has also increased*"" **\[5.2\]**. This is vitally important for victim\-survivors as the victim interview is typically the key evidence in the case, and directly linked to chances of the case resulting in a criminal charge. From 2018 the training module has been available to all forces nationally through the College of Policing **\[5.1\]**. 

 **4.3** \[text removed for publication\] **change training and pioneer new approach for reporting sexual offences** 

 In January 2020, Hohl started working with \[text removed for publication\] to help them develop bespoke sexual offences training \[text removed for publication\]. Hohl’s research\-based training **\[5.1; based on 3.1, 3.3, 3.4\]** now forms the basis for training of all \[text removed for publication\] Sexual Offences Investigation Trained \(SOIT\) officers. This means \[text removed for publication\] are providing a more ‘victim engagement based’ training for their dedicated SOIT officers across the country. In a joint testimonial, \[text removed for publication\] Head of Crime and Public Protection and the Sexual Offences Lead, commenting on the new training, said: “ *The feedback we have already started to receive from our victims is very positive and we are exploring a long\-term training strategy to improve our response to sexual offences in the future, which goes beyond the training of our SOIT officers as \[Hohl\] recommended and will be provided to several front\-line detectives. We have identified a further 72 officers across the country, whose initial response to investigations is vital in supporting our victims and guiding them through the investigative process”* **\[5.3\].** 

 As a result of Hohl’s research **\[3.2\]** \[text removed for publication\] is setting up a new, confidential reporting route for rape and sexual assault to reduce barriers to reporting. It will benefit rape and sexual assault victim\-survivors by giving them choice and control over the reporting process by making their report in their own words \(free recall\), at a time and place that feels safe for them using the online form, and have their crime recorded and investigated on equal footing to a standard in\-person report. The new online system can act to replace the standard reporting process and victim witness interview that many victim\-survivors experience as traumatic. \[text removed for publication\] said: “ *This is a phenomenal idea and without your research and recommendations we would not be in a position to take this forward. \[…\] Your recommendation of a ‘Confidential Reporting System’ \[…\] has now progressed into to an innovative and somewhat culturally challenging project for any police force to take forward. Without your research findings and recommendations within your proposal \[…\] I would not have been able to justify this project to our Chief Officer Group and obtain their support to produce a new system which will inevitably contradict any police forces’ objective to reduce crime statistics \[...\] Your input will be vital to the layout of this system, to encourage detailed reporting but also to support the survivors as more victims come forward.”* \[text removed for publication\] further confirms that the project team has broad stakeholder membership, including \[text removed for publication\] and a number of victims’ charities. Hohl continues to support the \[text removed for publication\] project and was appointed a standing member of the \[text removed for publication\] Sexual Offences Strategic Management Group in January 2020 **\[5.3\].** 

 **4.4 Domestic abuse: Changing police risk assessment processes** 

 The DASH risk assessment is crucial in police decision\-making in domestic abuse cases. It determines which actions, if any, police will take. ‘High risk’ cases are referred to a Multi\-Agency Risk Assessment Conference \(MARAC\) where victim safeguarding options are agreed by police together with other agencies. As such, police are the gatekeepers to safeguarding measures and incorrect risk assessment can have fatal consequences. Hohl’s findings on building victim rapport during the risk assessment interview and foregrounding indicators of coercive control **\[3.5, 5.4\]** changed \[text removed for publication\] practice and improved responses as measured by the police regulator, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services \(HMICFRS\). The Assistant Chief Constable, \[text removed for publication\], said: “… *the work done by Dr Hohl supported our wider work around the forces understanding of Domestic Abuse and has seen the force move from ‘requires improvement’ to a ‘good’ as put at the last inspection regime carried out by HMICFRS”* **\[5.5\]**. 

 The College of Policing, responsible for police guidelines and training nationally, used Myhill and Hohl’s **\[3.4\]** findings and recommendations to remove weak indicators of risk from the DASH, including using fewer indicators of physical violence and keeping more indicators of coercive control in the College’s revised risk assessment form **\[5.6\]**. The College recommends its use to all police forces and in its evaluation report \(2018\) says the: “ *revised risk tool for frontline officers may improve both victims’ disclosure and officers’ primary risk assessments*” **\[5.6, p.i\]**. 

 **4.5  Increased resource allocation to police response to domestic abuse during Covid\-19** 

 Since June 2020, Hohl and Johnson have been researching the impact of Covid\-19 on domestic abuse. Preliminary findings **\[3.6\]** have been widely shared through briefing documents and webinars with national stakeholders and two well\-attended public webinars in November 2020 \(ESRC Festival of Social Science, 641 participants; Violence against Women and Girls Research Network, 236 participants\). Hohl presented the findings at two National Police Chiefs Council \(NPCC\) Domestic Abuse Stakeholder Meetings in late 2020, attended by the domestic abuse leads of most UK police forces and all national stakeholders such as the Home Office, Crown Prosecution Service, Ministry of Justice, Domestic Abuse Commissioners’ Office and domestic abuse charities. This real time research has already generated policy interest with Hohl contributing to a Parliament horizon scanning briefing on  [‘Life Beyond Covid’](https://post.parliament.uk/life-beyond-covid-19-what-are-experts-concerned-about/) \(September 2020\) and being cited by the NPCC at a Home Affairs Select Committee on  [‘The Home Office preparedness for Covid\-19’](https://committees.parliament.uk/event/2432/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/) \(October 2020\). 

 The preliminary findings have directly led to increased resource allocation to domestic abuse in \[text removed for publication\]. A senior officer of \[text removed for publication\] said: “ *\[Hohl and Johnson’s\] project has already informed the constabulary’s decision\-making. This is mainly around allocation of resources to process demand relating to domestic abuse and other safeguarding referrals \[…\] The research provided an evidence base to show how demand around domestic abuse is changing and increasing. This has enabled a stronger case to be made to senior management about increasing the staffing to maintain an effective processing system*” **\[5.7\]**. At the national level, the findings have informed police understanding of domestic abuse during the Covid\-19 pandemic. \[text removed for publication\] said the results “ *have informed our understanding of how Covid\-19 is impacting on police recorded abuse and decision\-making on the matter*” **\[5.8\].** 

 **4.6 **Improving rape justice: Informing law reform internationally and nationally** 

 Beyond the UK, Hohl’s research has informed law reform in Japan and Australia. The Embassy of Japan in London invited Hohl to meet a delegation of the Japanese Ministry of Justice in October 2019 to seek her expertise to inform the reform of Japan’s rape law and investigation procedures **\[5.9\]**. The Australian Capital Territory ‘ *Crime Consent Amendment Bill 2018*’ cites the findings on victim memory **\[3.3\]** as part of its rationale for the Bill **\[5.10\].** In the UK, Hohl has acted as an ad\-hoc academic expert adviser/reviewer to the College of Policing, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, Scottish Government, Safeguarding Minister, and the Centre for Women’s Justice. She is currently a member of the Ministry of Justice Expert Network \(since 2018\), the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime \(MOPAC\) London Academic Observatory \(since 2014\), and the advisory board to the MOPAC Lighthouse evaluation project – an integrated multi\-agency hub for victims of child sexual abuse \(since 2019\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Middlesex has been advancing digital twin research in programming technologies and applications \(Prof. Barn and Prof. Clark \(2011\-2016\) with Tata Consultancy Services \(TCS\) and in digital twins for structural health monitoring of large\-scale infrastructures \(Prof. Nguyen\). 

 Impacts have included industry\-scale demonstrators for TCS clients, strengthening a robust Java implementation of Enterprise Simulation Language leading to a TCS product TwinX™, design simulations and non\-pharmaceutical interventions for managing the COVID\-19 Pandemic in Pune, India and software tools to produce a repair and maintenance plan for the Thăng Long bridge in Hanoi, Vietnam resulting in benefits of £9.1 million \(£1.5m of savings on repair costs \+ £7.6m of estimated economy benefit\).

###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Middlesex Computer Science undertakes world\-leading research to improve the quality of software systems development. Today, quality of software is dependent upon large\-scale, networked, semi\-autonomous interdependent systems. Such systems no longer have fixed behaviour and must invariably adapt to achieve their intended function and even change function over time. Consequently, software architects and designers require higher level abstract tools to understand system complexity and interdependencies. Simulation and modelling are core aspects of such work. Beyond software, similar methods of working are also applicable to engineering problems associated with large\-scale infrastructures. During this REF research period, these approaches have coalesced around the notion of a Digital Twin \(DT\). Generally, a DT is a virtual representation of a real\-world physical artifact or system that is linked to enable use of real\-time data to enable learning, reasoning and dynamically adapting for improved decision making. DTs can be of many types depending upon the features in play and the purpose for which they are defined. 

 This section describes <ins> **two**</ins> broad directions of research activity associated with what is now widely known as a Digital Twin \(DT\): first, our work on software engineering and, second, our more recent work on structural health monitoring. The integration of model\-based software engineering and the proving of conceptual advances in complex scenarios is a hallmark of our approach to DT research. 

 <ins> **\(a\)</ins> <ins>Software Engineering:**</ins> Barn and Clark’s work has developed language\-based simulation and modelling techniques to design, analyse and adapt the quality\-assured development of complex enterprise systems. After initial research on lightweight methods for enterprise modelling, the entirety of this work has been performed in collaboration with TCS and its research lab in Pune. Critically, it is not *just* an application of research, but much more: it is industry and academia working in collaboration to address emerging industry\-scale problems. Barn and Clark’s contribution has led to new methods and technologies, the development of which is described in the rest of this section. The collaboration illustrates how the research has responded and adapted to the emerging sub\-discipline of DT that first became significant in 2016. 

 Existing approaches to digital twin representation of enterprise modelling are not suitable as a basis for simulation and analysis.  Barn and Clark’s collaborative research directly led to the construction of an executable modelling language called LEAP \(Lightweight Precise Enterprise Architecture\), together with a toolset for enterprise simulation \[R1\]. This research was reported in India’s premier Software Engineering Conference – ISEC, attended by representatives from most of India’s premier industrial research labs. ISEC has an acceptance rate of around 13\-15% and is notable for the representation of industrial researchers. The LEAP work was identified by TCS as potential technology that could be exploited by TCS as they embarked on a research strategy focused on idea of the Model Driven Organization \(MDO\). LEAP thus formed the basis of a collaborative initiative between Middlesex and TCS Research leading to a conceptual research paper published in the Core\-ranked A conference \- HICSS \[R2\]. MDO was promoted by a series of dedicated workshops at international conferences. MDO subsequently became integral to the research strategy for TCS software engineering research area. 

 From 2013 to date, Barn has been hosted annually by TCS Research in Pune India for two weeks to co\-develop research that has had a direct influence on the TCS Research strategy and their interactions with clients. These visits led to the co\-creation of a technology\-based method for organization modelling and decision\-making, reported in the leading ACM/IEEE Models Conference series \[R3\].  This work was a development derived directly from the original work in LEAP. The key contribution of this work is a conceptual meta\-model expressed in terms of goals, execution traces, simulation levers, and agents, for constructing enterprise models that can be used to aid decision\-makers. Aspects of this work were also executed by TCS’s funding of a distance learning PhD student, a senior scientist at TCS, to undertake doctoral studies at Middlesex. Souvik Barat completed in 2018 and his work, supervised by Barn, led to the development of methodology for enterprise decision making. This annual collaboration, initially seeded by the groundwork of the research published in \[R1\] has led to new products being marketed by TCS \[S7, S8\]. 

 To validate the conceptual model, a number of case studies were developed and reported in publications. A particular interest was focused on the use of the technology for modelling socio\-technical contexts. Some of that research used ESL and its underlying conceptual model in an exploratory case study examining India’s demonetization strategy of 2016. This validation would provide confidence later in the work done on COVID\-19 reported below. 

 Clark led on the development of a technology to support the modelling and decision\-making approach. The agent\-based technology takes the form of a novel programming language called ESL and an associated development platform called EDB \( [http://www.esl\-lang.org](http://www.esl-lang.org/), \[R4\]\) both of which are open source. The platform was then extended and used in a Digital Twin context with research being reported in \[R5\]. 

 Following expansion and evolution of DT research, in 2019, Middlesex established the London Digital Twin Research Centre Centre \( [https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/](https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdt.mdx.ac.uk%2F&data=04%7C01%7CB.Barn%40mdx.ac.uk%7Cb9ac1274a5224106a3c108d8eeb7b7c8%7C38e37b88a3a148cf9f056537427fed24%7C0%7C0%7C637521820114988075%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=IsAoWKiV4TDoIV%2F793TqFKVS9lHrCLWwy2%2FT65uqN8E%3D&reserved=0)\) . Further work now includes: Building Information Management, and Smart Factory \(working closely with Festo and Siemens\) as well as consolidating work on Structural Health Monitoring. The Centre’s ethos is that modelling gains from application, complexity spurs research innovation, and international collaboration enables both. 

 <ins> **\(b\)</ins> <ins>Digital Twins for Structural Health Monitoring</ins> <ins>\(SHM\)</ins><ins>:</ins><ins>**</ins> 

 A well\-documented use for Digital Twins is in the area of structural health monitoring of large infrastructure artefacts such as bridges and buildings. In 2018, Prof. Nguyen received funding for two international collaboration grants \- from the Newton Fund \( [https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page\_id=36](https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page_id=36)\) and from the UKIERI \( [https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page\_id=37](https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/?page_id=37)\). 

 In collaboration with the University of Transport and Communications \(UTC\), Vietnam, Prof. Nguyen has been addressing the problem of how to detect damage and predict future maintenance requirements of large infrastructures such as bridges due to aging, environmental change, vehicular loads and other human\-induced factors. 

 The research reported in \[R6\] addressed the issue of inherent high dimensionality of measured structure data in raw time series sensory signals for SHM using different deep learning techniques to assess the reliability as well as the trade\-off between accuracy and of different deep learning models, assisting the relevant stakeholders to make informed decision in maintenance and operation of bridges. 

 The work in \[R7\] makes use of physical features embedded in raw data and an elaborated hybrid deep learning model, featuring two algorithms—convolutional neural network \(CNN\) and long\-short term memory \(LSTM\). Building on advances in algorithms for health monitoring uniting machine learning, structural mechanics and signal processing Nguyen developed a novel hybrid approach that delivered highly accurate results in detecting damage and its severity even for multiple damage scenarios. The resulting method has been a practical end\-to\-end data\-driven framework used for defining a Digital Twin for automatically monitoring the operational state of structures. This framework is reported in the *IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering* \[R7\]. These works were integrated in a Cloud based Digital Twin platform \( [http://3.140.199.12/](http://3.140.199.12/)\) that was critical to the repair plan development of the Thăng Long bridge in Hanoi, Vietnam by the Ministry of Transport resulting in savings of £1.5 million on repair costs and benefits of £7.6 million in economy \[S12\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 International and industry collaborations have shaped Middlesex’s leadership in applied digital twin research. It has been arrived at from two different starting points but shares the underlying principle of *model based design*. This section outlines the impacts from both strands of work. 

 <ins> **\(a\)</ins> <ins>Impacts arising from our</ins> <ins>Software Engineering</ins> <ins>research</ins><ins>:**</ins> 

 The work in software engineering, closely developed with TCS, is an example of a pioneering research collaboration in an emerging area of technology between academia and industry where knowledge transfer is continuous and facilitated by annual sabbatical residencies, presentations to TCS staff, joint publication, and supervision of TCS research staff. 

 TCS Research is a pioneer in core technology infrastructure to support Model Driven Engineering \(MDE\) and has delivered several large business critical software systems using this infrastructure for almost 20 years. They recognized that MDE could be applied to address all aspects of an enterprise such as vision, mission, goal, strategies and operational processes. These research questions were congruent with the LEAP research conducted by Barn and Clark \[R1\] and it is this that shaped the collaboration. The \[S1\] letter from the Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of TCS confirms the basis of the collaboration, the ongoing work and the benefit of contributions of Barn and Clark to TCS activity. 

 After the initial influence of R1, the research collaboration between Middlesex and TCS was formally noted in a memorandum of cooperation. A co\-designed research agenda was initiated, with the aim that it should lead directly to products for creating agent\-based simulation models of enterprises. The research roadmap was conceptualized in the MDO vision paper \[R2\] and then formalized into a research roadmap report for TCS customers and shareholders \[S3\]. 

 As a result of this research collaboration, TCS has been able to raise their profile in the area of enterprise modelling and simulation.  This has had a positive impact on client satisfaction and loyalty, the generation of new revenue streams and their reputation for research\-led innovation. Specific examples include: 

-  Development of the TCS world\-leading digital twin product – TwinX™ based on the meta model developed by Barn and Clark. The TwinX™ product is now being being provided as solution by TCS to companies such as VodafoneZiggo and has a product manager assigned – Kaustav Bhattacharya \[S2\]. 

-  Proof\-of\-concept demonstrators. The technology arising from the research has been showcased by TCS using proof\-of\-concept demonstrators \[S1\]. Case studies covering various business optimisation requirements based on  ESL \[research reported in R7\] were developed. These included:  Optimizing operation of a parcel sorting terminal;  Optimization of order\-to\-activation process of a telecommunications company using digital twin based on ESL; and Optimized stock\-replenishment for shops in a retail supply chain using digital twin based on ESL. 

-  New Business.  The extension of ESL with machine learning capabilities described in \[R5\] has been applied by TCS Research to a commercial problem provided by a European supermarket client. The company has, to date, been using a system\-dynamics approach to simulation which takes several weeks to stabilize and produce a solution. Using the ESL\-based machine learning simulation, TCS Research has been able to demonstrate the reduction of the stabilization time to a matter of hours. In this case, both the approach and the ESL technology have supported TCS in promoting TCS Research to existing and new clients \[S1\]. 

-  Conceptual scope in company R&D.   TCS research labs incorporated MDO as one of their research themes as described in their promotional literature to clients and shareholders \[S2\]. 

-  Barn and Clark co\-supervised a TCS Research employee on a doctoral programme at Middlesex from 2015\-18. \[S4\].  The successful PhD has diffused ESL knowledge within the TCS through the recruitment of three new researchers specifically to develop local expertise in ESL. This was seen as critical for transferring research knowledge to the end user and building capacity in digital twin simulation at TCS. 

 To reach a broader audience beyond research, Barn is a co\-editor of a book initiated by TCS Research ‘Advanced Digital Architectures for Model\-Driven Adaptive Enterprises’ with IGI\-Global. The book contains by\-invitation contributions from industry leaders in the field and aims to establish TCS as a thought leader in the field of model driven enterprises and simulation\-based methods \[S5\]. The book is aimed at practitioners seeking to understand digital twin technology. It was promoted via a post by Sankha Som, Chief Innovation Evangelist to his 500\+ connections on LinkedIn. His post reported on the collaboration with Middlesex regarding Enterprise Modelling and stated how this “ **area has already made its way into Enterprise Digital Twins that we are developing for various domains such as Telecom…”** \[S8\]. 

 Our earlier research had already indicated that the design approach and the ESL technology was viable in socio\-technical systems \[R6\]. In early April 2020, colleagues at TCS developed a local Java implementation of ESL that originally developed at Middlesex. The TCS implementation has been productized as the Java TwinX™ Library. This software has been used to model scenarios for non\-pharmaceutical interventions for the COVID\-19 pandemic in the Pune region by working closely with a local Pune based NGO \(PrayasPune.org\). The fine\-grained analysis of COVID\-19 pandemic management was led by Dr Souvik Barat using the TwinX™ Java library based on ESL. Details of the simulation are described in \[S7\] where the role of Dr Barat as lead on the TCS team is documented. This \(ongoing – March 2021\) activity has been reported in a Pune\-based newspaper and in national newspapers and is shown in \[S6\]. On 03/03/2021, the national TV channel, MirrorNow, ran a debate about Maharashtra’s recent COVID\-19 pandemic spike in infections \(available at:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x48G7\-bOvPY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x48G7-bOvPY)\). On this programme, Dr Abhay Shukla \(national convenor, the People’s Health Movement\-India\), noted: 

 *“The TCS\-Prayas model that has been published, it has predicted the second wave back in mid\-December, at a pretty accurate level.”* \[S9\] 

###  <ins>\(b\)</ins> <ins>Impacts from Digital Twins for Structural Health Monitoring:</ins> 

 The digital twin developments arising from the TCS collaboration and collaboration with Prof. Nguyen led to the Faculty of Science and Technology establishing the  [London Digital Twin Research Centre \(LDTRC\).](https://dt.mdx.ac.uk/) Research outputs \[R6, R7\] from an international collaboration funded by the Newton Fund and UKIERI were brought to the attention of Ministry of Transport of the Vietnamese Government.  The Ministry of Transport collaborated with a project team from Middlesex and the University of Transport and Communications, Hanoi. Using the conceptual and modelling developments reported in section 2. The collaboration has led to: 

-  Preparation of a repair plan by the research team for the Thăng Long bridge in Hanoi, Vietnam by the Ministry of Transport resulting in savings of £1.5 million on repair costs. 

-  Early re\-opening of the Thăng Long bridge helped reduce traffic flow resulting in an estimated further benefit to the economy of Hanoi of around £7.6 million. 

-  Policy development in digital transformation for infrastructures in Vietnam. The Ministry of Transport intends to use the digital twin technology developed by Middlesex and UTC on other bridges including Nhật Tân bridge, Cần Thơ bridge, and  Mỹ Thuận bridge 

 The engagement and utilisation of the research \[R6, R7\] was essential in reducing the maintenance costs and was reported as critical in policy development in helping Vietnam towards digital transformation for infrastructures \[S10\], which was reported on the national TV programme “Digital Nation” in Vietnam on 7<sup>th</sup> March 2021 \[S11\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Asthma is the commonest childhood disease, affecting around 1,000,000 children in the UK and 100,000,000 worldwide. Treatment is delivered with inhaler devices, but adherence is often poor. Our research at the University of Manchester on sound analysis and gamification has transformed treatment acceptability by developing an inhaler mask with an audible whistle sound to indicate good technique. This whistle sound activates cartoons on a mobile device specifically designed to encourage compliance. The technology has led to a spinout company, Clin\-e\-cal, and been used by over 100,000 children worldwide. Studies demonstrate it reduces problems in medication delivery.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 Children with asthma are often anxious about treatment and have poor adherence with their medication, leading to serious health consequences. The aim of this project was to counter this major health issue by producing an affordable system which would improve breathing technique and adherence with treatment for children with asthma symptoms. 

 In early studies, Aslam developed expertise in computerised image processing including transformation and analysis of image data with highly sensitive and specific expert system algorithms. These algorithms have been able to extract clinically relevant information from ophthalmic images taken using multiple imaging modalities \[1, 2\]. The same techniques acquired in ophthalmology were used for this respiratory project to analyse and extract clinically useful information from the sound of correct inhaler use to detect correct inhalations. 

 Aslam studied gamification techniques with Henson to facilitate the complex tasks of measuring peripheral visual fields in children \[3\] and with Murray to develop automated and accurate central vision testing using games on tablet computers \[4, 5\]. Principles from these ophthalmology projects, to encourage children to interact with vision tests via games, were translated to encourage children to interact with inhaler medication. 

 Aslam used the above experience to design a system for masks and spacers such that the sounds of correct inhalation could be detected and activate multi\-stage cartoon animations / games on a screen – these would reduce anxiety and encourage specific and correct breathing patterns in children. In collaboration with Murray, Aslam designed and conducted a study to measure the impact of the device on children’s acceptance of spacer treatment using questionnaires given to children and parents \[6\]. Both parents and children responded positively to the device in this initial feasibility study: 13/14 children said it helped them take their medication and 13/14 parents felt that the device helped their children use their spacer and made them calmer. Children responded positively, citing the system as something that was fun rather than stressful. 

 This system provided the framework for a final version named Rafi\-tone \(‘Respiratory Aid for Inhalers’\). Rafi\-tone consists of a mask that emits a whistle when the child is breathing correctly, serving as a simple, reliable and reassuring indicator to children and parents. Detection of the whistle sound by a mobile application can drive a cartoon game, designed to encourage the correct form of breathing \- the system essentially involves children in an onscreen, fun, animated game, which rewards them for correct inhaler use.

#  4. Details of the impact 

##  Context 

 Asthma is a life\-threatening disease requiring drug\-delivery into the lungs via devices known as inhalers. Younger children can find taking the inhaler difficult and so it is often attached to one end of a cylindrical chamber, or spacer, and then pressed to release the drug into this spacer. A mask on the other end of the spacer allows the child to breathe in the drug more easily from the chamber through several breaths. However, this technique is associated with poor adherence and reduced drug delivery to the lungs. Treatments are missed or given with poor technique, which is exacerbated by children being distressed. Poor adherence with spacers in children is a major health and socio\-economic problem, with an estimated 14% of all children globally experiencing symptoms, and levels of adherence to treatment reported to be as low as 28%. 

##  Pathway to impact – new technology 

 The Rafi\-tone system, developed in 2016, uses a mask designed to produce a specific whistle which provides an auditory cue when breathing is correct. Software provides entertaining visual encouragement to a child when this is heard \(Figure 1\) and logs correct treatment in a digital calendar. The mask whistle improves carer and children’s confidence that the drug has been inhaled, and the additional app is used by educators to train carers and children in whistle spacer use, especially if there are known compliance issues. 



 Figure 1. Illustration of the mask, spacer and inhaler, with mask whistle activating the Rafi\-tone games. 

 Aslam’s research is novel in providing an accessible system, combining animation type games to motivate treatment compliance and providing reassurance to parents/ carers that optimum treatment has been given. 

##  Reach and significance of the impact 

###  Clinical impact on asthmatic children worldwide 

 The mask and associated app make inhaler use more fun, transforming perceptions and improving adherence and breathing technique in children. 

 An independent, international randomised controlled trial of 371 children was conducted, comparing app use with standard verbal instructions \[A\]. The trial found that lung functions of children using the app were significantly \(p<0.001\) improved. The percentage of patients improved according to an asthma control test was higher in the app group compared to the verbal instruction group. Compliance also improved subjectively and objectively. 

 An independent post\-marketing survey of 6\-10 weeks’ use of the mask and app was conducted on 112 asthmatics \(aged 1\-11\) and their parents. Survey results showed that use of doctor/hospital services reduced from 16/6 at baseline to 4/1 respectively at follow\-up \[B\]. All of the 10 independent healthcare practitioners surveyed stated that their patients were better controlled using the Rafi\-tone system \[B\]. This evidence implies significant benefit to children who have used the system. There have been over 112,000 international mask sales since its inception in 2016. App use is steadily rising, with over 4,000 maintained downloads, currently 250 per month \(as at July 2020\). The mask and app are available in the UK, France, Norway, Sweden and Australia. 

 A GP practice pharmacist stated that she “ *had the most amazing experience*” with the Rafi\-tone system and that this technology was a “ *game changer*” for her practice and patients \[C\]. Other quotes from health carers have included “ *Great idea. Easy to use and good distraction for children—makes inhaler delivery so much easier*” \[D\]. Example quotes from parents have included “ *Good distraction and improved technique. New to inhalers so made him less scared*”; *‘‘Yes, it has definitely helped in breathing technique. T* *was previously taking shallow breaths but with the game managed to focus on deeper breaths and concentrated on playing the game.’’;* “… *helps to direct the child’s attention and focus on breathing. Enjoyable activity. No bad points \- a really good idea. A good way to introduce inhalers*” \[D\]. 

###  Economic impact of Clin\-e\-cal, a new technology company 

 Clin\-e\-cal, an innovative digital health company, arose entirely from the research for Rafi\-tone. Founded by Aslam through a partnership with doctors, researchers and hospital teams, it has been established now for six years \[E\]. Clin\-e\-cal’s collaboration with Clement Clarke International directly led to the whistle that activates the Rafi\-tone app. The app successfully qualified for the prestigious NHS apps store \[F\]. The mask is produced by Clement Clarke and is available via prescription \[G\], meaning that it is readily available. 

 Clin\-e\-cal has two full\-time members of staff, a board of six members and robust and increasing income streams of approximately currently GBP20,000 per month. The company has attracted GBP250,000 external venture capital funding, allowing expansion and diversification. 

 In summary, research studies, testimonials and sales indicate that the easily accessible Rafi\-tone technology has transformed clinical care for tens of thousands of children internationally, improving adherence and addressing the serious morbidity associated with asthma and viral induced wheeze.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The University of Bradford has established digital documentation as a mainstay for heritage research. Impacts are driven by world leading research in 3D scanning and visualisation and open data. In human bioarchaeology we have created a virtual resource and a drive for the ethical use of human remains data in education for applications in pathology and forensics. A corpus of work in the global museums sector has enhanced of public engagement through 3D scanning and virtual display. We have enhanced the lives of refugees and displaced societies through work with digital heritage and co\-creation as a new and valuable toolkit for social cohesion and wellbeing. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Transformative research on digital imaging combined with image capture, processing, analysing and presentation of rich 3D datasets has led to impact in several key areas. In the area of human remains, the From Cemetery to Clinic/Digitised Diseases projects \(Wilson with Buckberry, Gaffney C. assisted by Sparrow \(2011\-2013\) \( **R1\)** used research into the use of high\-fidelity methods for object capture to produce ground\-breaking educational and research assets. The projects New Tools and Old Stones \(Evans, 2012\) and Visualising Hard Animal Tissues \(Wilson, 2013\-2014\) followed, which expanded our research into the pioneering use of high\-fidelity methods for object capture to support the digital curation and sharing of artefacts and scarce, protected resources. Further fundamental research and innovation in the AHRC Digital Transformations Theme Large Grant, Fragmented Heritage \(Wilson and Evans, 2013\-2019\) explored the quality of digital capture methods \(photography and 3D scanning\), visualisation approaches and other outputs, including 3D printing for museum display \( **R3**\). The results brought about a revolution in micro and macro 3D visualisation methods \( **R2**\). This project included ground\-breaking workflows using citizen science \(e.g. Fossil Finders\) and web\-scraping/crowd\-sourcing of imagery \(Curious Travellers, Gaffney C. and V.\).  Recent investment from Research England World Class Laboratories fund for digital storage will sustain and secure the legacy of this open data. 

 Further innovative developments of note explore citizen science approaches. Fossil Finder produced landmark and unsurpassed high resolution aerial imagery of fossil beds in Kenya \[ **R**4\] and was the first project that allowed the public to directly participate in the search for early human remains and palaeo\-landscapes. UKRI strategic initiatives enabled us to target support towards ODA countries and global challenges, Augmenting Jordanian Heritage \(Led by Wilson and Evans \[2016\-19\]\) was developed to transfer knowledge from within the Fragmented Heritage project and build capacity in the heritage and tourism sector in Jordan. This supported the creation of an asset bank of valuable Jordanian artefacts and sites, explored the use of virtual\-reality and augmented museum display for dissemination, provided high\-level training in the use of digital heritage techniques and approaches, and has left a legacy of capacity with the Jordan Museum to build digital heritage capacity in the region. Curious\-Travellers advanced the use of crowd\-sourced and web\-scraped imagery to reconstruct 3D models of heritage that had been damaged or destroyed. It co\-produced new cultural resources of UNESCO World Heritage sites including Palmyra, Syria; in Kathmandu, Nepal, this was used to inform rebuilding post\-earthquake \[ **R5**\] \(co\-investigator Wilson, research assisted by Sparrow \[2018\-19\]\). Knowledge and practice that underpins the Curious Travellers approach was repurposed within the BReaTHe project \(Led by Evans with Croucher, Wilson \[2019\-21\]\). There, digital heritage has been used as a tool to promote social cohesion and individual wellbeing with a view to increasing personal security in displaced communities. This included working with refugees based in camps through Humanitarian organisation Mercy Corps and integrating communities within the local township \[ **R6**\].

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Human Bioarchaeology – virtual surrogates** 

 Digitised Diseases has been at the forefront of a global uptake of open\-data in developing open\-access 3D resources for human bioarchaeology. Our approach addressed the threat of pressure on osteological collections, highlighting the role of 3D capture as a conservation record for fragile pathological bone specimens. The resource addressed training needs in biological anthropology, history of medicine and for clinicians concerned with chronic conditions, neglected diseases and re\-emerging conditions, with greatest uptake in N. America where constraints with human remains collections has encouraged significant use. The resource has been accessed more than 3,437,887 times globally. The resource has been used in institutions for osteological teaching and individual learning throughout the world, with metrics for 2020 showing that usage of the resource in North America is now more than 5.7 times that of the UK, highlighting the need for virtual material work with in places that have limited access to collections of human remains \[ **C1**\]. The project has changed perceptions and approaches, informing and cited in the development of a BABAO imaging code and as co\-signatory to Kyoto WAC resolution on ethical use of digital human bioarchaeology data. Increased usage throughout the periods of regional and national lockdowns imposed during 2020\-21 due to COVID\-19 illustrate the value of this virtual resource when physical collections are inaccessible \(monthly website traffic reached a peak >4 times more than normal during lockdown\) \[ **C1**\]. 

 **Public Engagement through virtual and physical surrogates** 

 The Visualising Heritage group has tested through multiple avenues of engagement, the capability for enhanced visitor experience and understanding of cultural heritage, in using 3D printing of cultural objects. Multiple examples exist including the Stonehenge Visitor Centre exhibition which reopened December 2013. Historic England funded research undertaking 3D scans to create 3D prints of Neolithic cranium from Winterbourne Stoke Long Barrow to provide facial reconstruction giving visitors the chance to “meet” a Neolithic individual.​Around 58,000 copies of the guidebook purchased each year and >9 million visitors have viewed this since the visitor centre opened personalising their experience of this world\-renowned ritual landscape \[ **C2**\]. In Slovenia, as part of the ENTRANS project, the group exhibited replicas of enlarged sections of bronze age objects increasing access to these national cultural treasures and contributed to improved public understanding of ancient manufacturing techniques, usually only seen under a microscope. The group also contributed to the Ice Age in Europe exhibition \(2015\-2017\) by producing a replica of the Happisburgh beach where footprints dating to around 1 million years were discovered \(and since lost\) following a storm. Visitors could stand on this to allow them to understand variations in deep human linages \(‘Ice Age Island’ Exhibit was mentioned in Jersey Heritage Trust annual report as contributing to a 3.5% increase in visitors to Jersey\); the exhibit itself had 65,000 visitors \[ **C3**\]. 

 **Co\-creation of knowledge through Citizen Science and Inclusion** 

 Fossil Finder transformed traditional methods of field survey in remote locations and was launched at the British Science Festival \(2015\), providing a web portal to the public and inviting all interested to take part in the search for human fossil remains. This generated over 12,000 visits per month, creating a landmark change in accessibility to such activities, widening participation to allow disabled people and individuals from financially underprivileged backgrounds to take part in exploration. It attracted over 8000 registered contributors from 98% of countries, and many more casual users who found and labelled new fossil finds in over 120,000 images \[ **C4**\], and it created a new understanding of fossil density in the Turkana Basin. 

 Curious Travellers involved the public in efforts to record cultural heritage that had been damaged or destroyed. Methods developed through the Curious Travellers project enable 3D visualisation of heritage lost or damaged by neglect, cultural vandalism, conflict and natural disasters. The repurposing of crowd\-sourced and web\-scraped imagery has been used to rebuild 3D models of structures, including the Temple of Bel at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Palmyra in Syria, previously destroyed by ISIS \(utilising 109,269 images, equivalent to 205GB data\) \[ **C5**\]. This workflow was also used to enhance understanding of architectural practice, design and planning, as with post\-disaster reconstruction and resilience work in the aftermath of the 7.8Mw magnitude earthquake that destroyed temples and religious complexes in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Kathmandu, Nepal. Detailed 3D models were built through web\-scraping/crowd\-sourcing \(303,000 images were sourced, of which 50,000 were sampled and filtered, with 25,000 images matched\). Point clouds for the Durbar and temple squares are \~350 million points in total and where possible these have been processed to produce meshed and textured models. The resultant images, database files and processed 3D models \(\~2.8TB\), together with mobile mapping data have directly contributed to understanding and workflows used by conservation architects to inform the rebuilding of the World Heritage Site \[ **C6**\]. 

 **Empowerment through Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer & Changing Lives in Lower and Middle Income Societies** 

 Augmenting Jordanian Heritage provided in\-country training and workshops as part of overseas development aid which have produced enhanced 3D display of artefacts within Jordanian National Museum; ongoing work in empowering key individuals in heritage governance within Jordan by digital upskilling for increased reliance on digital exhibits and information \[ **C7**\]. The BReaTHe project has successfully utilised digital heritage engagement to improve the quality of life of displaced individuals and communities \[ **C8**\]. The project developed multiple assets, utilised those from the group’s catalogue of projects, including Curious Travellers, plus further citizen\-donated datasets into VR\-ready content. These were co\-created in dialogue with displaced refugee communities from Syria, working with the international aid agency Mercy Corps at Azraq camp and with Jordan Heritage in Azraq township. Used outside enclosed refugee camps, the work has transformed the ability for the effective leadership of a community \[C9\] and caused a change in social structure that has significantly improved the quality of life within the refugee camps \[ **C10**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

-  Continued contribution to Surrey Nanosystems \(a NEC@ATI spin\-out\), with input to new R&D \(2014\-\) creating Vantablack™, tripling the liquidation value since 2014 \(£24M in 2018, \~£30M in 2020\). Vantablack™ became a global brand at the Hyundai Pavilion \(2018 Winter Olympics\) and in 2019 at the Frankfurt Motor Show with the BMW VBX6. 

-  Nanotechnology coating innovation led to Airbus committing €10M to take patented solutions to higher TRLs in their Copernicus Extension, Earth Explorer and Science Cosmic Vision programmes, now on trials with the European Space Agency \(ESA\). 

-  Nanotechnology innovation at the NEC@ATI resulted in 12 patents filed, 2 spin\-outs \(SilverRay in 2018, Radical Fibres in 2020\) with a combined value \~£2M, and the creation of 10 high\-skill jobs. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 New and continued research at the NanoElectronics Centre at the Advanced Technology Institute \(NEC@ATI\), headed by Professor Silva, has expanded on developing applications, manufacturing solutions and capabilities for carbon nanotechnologies, for areas ranging from space and flight technologies to energy conversion and recovery, and healthcare sensing and monitoring applications. 

 **Manufacturing nanomaterials compatible with electronics and the creation of a nanomaterial global brand:** 

 Surrey NanoSystems \(SNS\) was founded as a NEC@ATI spin\-out in 2006 and provides an established commercial outlet for nanomaterials developed through innovative research at the University of Surrey. The spin\-out commercialised a manufacturing process \[R1\] for novel carbon nanotube \(CNT\) electronics and low permittivity dielectrics, a solution that permitted nanostructures typically grown at high temperatures \(>700°C\) for high specification devices, whilst keeping substrates below 400°C \(a semiconductor industry requirement\). In 2014, the low\-temperature CNT growth capacity led to a project partnership with the National Physical Laboratory \(NPL\) and ABSL Space Products to develop super\-black coatings to enhance the performance of sensitive electro\-optical imaging systems in a satellite application \(see E1, E2\). This resulted in the creation of Vantablack™ – Vertically Aligned NanoTube Array Black \- an array of carbon nanotubes with remarkable properties for trapping light, briefly holding a Guinness World Record for the blackest man\-made material, at 99.96% absorbance. It is now considered the default industry standard for highest quality black material. 

###  Coating and nanomaterial innovation for space exploration and aerospace: 

 The traditional manufacturing of satellite devices has used precision engineering of metals and ceramics \(a resource intensive and costly procedure\). More recently satellites have been manufactured from carbon\-fibre\-reinforced\-polymers \(CFRP\), which have higher tolerance to mechanical failure, a decrease in weight and cost. However, there are issues with the release of trapped moisture from the CFRP when in flight/vacuum or on launch; this release affects the dimensional stability of the coatings, rendering them defective. 

 NEC@ATI collaborated with Airbus, over the last 10 years \(see E3\), to develop a novel carbon fibre coating process to prevent moisture absorption and release from materials that can distort dimensions, which removes the need for weeks of outbaking of CFRPs prior to flight, and many £100,000’s in costs. The coating is an effective moisture barrier, and effective for protecting satellites in flight, in vacuum, or on launch. This allows the industry to move away from the precision engineering metals and high\-performance ceramics. The developed technology allows deposition of thin multi\-layer coatings onto complex surfaces, evenly and reproducibly \[R2\]. 

 The original CNT manufacturing process \[R1\] was used with Bombardier to improve aerospace composite manufacturing by using CNTs grown on fibres to strengthen the mechanical bond between the resin and the fibre, significantly increasing the fracture toughness and removing the need for sizing \[R3\]. 

 NEC@ATI research has shown that embedding nanofibre veils and carbon nanomaterials in aerospace composites can significantly improve their mechanical properties and have innovated solutions for scaling up the production of polymer nanofibres \[R4\]. 

 Leading research into efficient energy conversion \[R5\], NEC@ATI researchers developed a printing\-based manufacturing technique for very efficient, flexible, organic X\-ray detectors, resulting in a significant advance in X\-ray detection technology, with 2\-3 order of magnitude higher sensitivities and low voltage operation.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

###  Continued economic and societal impact through original spin\-out Surrey NanoSystems and the creation of a global brand product, Vantablack™: 

 The creation of the Vantablack™ product and its subsequent establishment as a global brand involved significant innovation, input, metrology and testing \[R1\] from the NEC@ATI group \(see E1, E2\). As a result of this successful project, the company has changed its business model and is now focused solely on the production and application of Vantablack™. The company value has tripled in 2020, compared with 2014 \[E1 and Companies House\]. Vantablack™ has since progressed to market in a number of sectors, including space/aerospace, automobiles, cameras, standards, and telescopes. 

 As a technological material, Vantablack™ was tested as a coating material for optical probes aboard the Kent Ridge 1 satellite \(launched December 2015 for the purpose of disaster monitoring and relief in Asia\) and is now space\-qualified over 8 critical areas for use as blackbody calibration units, complex baffles and spectrometers, with instruments coated in Vantablack™ being part of the latest Northrop\-Grumann’s CRS12 Cygnus launch to the International Space Station \(November 2019\) \[E4\]. This has led to a significant revenue increase to Surrey Nanosystem, triggering a doubling of the highly skilled workforce and a move to new, larger \(doubling footprint\) premises in 2019. 

###  Vantablack™ as a cultural artifact and raising public awareness of carbon nanotubes technologies: 

 Vantablack™ has been introduced as a new pigment of colour in the palette of artists and was licenced for sole artistic use by Sir Anish Kapoor \[E5\] – creator of the London 2021’s Orbit sculpture – prompting media debate on the ‘licensing of colour’.  Vantablack™ has been used to striking effect in the Hyundai pavilion at the 2018 Winter Olympics, with 60K visitors in 5 weeks, to launch the new BMW VBX6 \(The Beast\) at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show and manufacture high\-end bespoke timepieces \(e.g. MCT S110EVO\), as well as launch several consumer products, including the Call of Duty’s Black Ops 4 tested by England’s footballer, Dele Alli, raising public awareness and discussion on the use of carbon nanotubes and emerging technologies. 

###  Innovation and bespoke manufacturing solutions for aerospace applications, developing moisture barrier layers for Airbus: 

 Ongoing collaborations between NEC@ATI and Airbus Defence and Space have leveraged the NEC@ATI group’s experience in nano\-manufacturing technologies \[R2, R3\] to solve issues of coating complex, 3D\-shapes and devices for space applications and the need to develop appropriate moisture barriers within the Earth, Observation, Navigation and Science \(ENS\) perimeter. This research has resulted in the development of unique processes, novel multilayers compatible with space structures and novel vacuum chambers for coating large pieces of equipment, to be used by Airbus for future space missions \[E1\]. 

 The novel coating method and materials developed by NEC@ATI solved a previously intractable problem for the space industry \(that needed components to be wrapped in a third\-party material that reduced lifetime\), as well as reducing the cost associated with the bench\-to\-space system \(ca. £100k/component\). The promising results have led to Airbus Defence and Space, and European Space Agency adopting the business case for this technology at division level and investing over €10M to be implemented in the radar instruments/payload \(TRL 7, currently\) and optical instruments/payload \(TRL 6\), to cover IP, facility industrialisation, testing and certification. It is expected that this will become the standard for ESA space missions. 

###  Innovation culture within the NEC@ATI group has led to 12 patent applications and 2 spin\-out companies exploring some of these innovations and associated know\-how: 

 SilverRay Ltd: started in 2018 to commercialise NEC@ATI’s IP \[R4\], providing 4 highly skilled industrial jobs and has secured private and government funding \[E6\] to take flexible, organic detectors to large scale manufacturing, leveraging their ease of production and conformability with complex surfaces. 

 Radical Fibres Ltd **:** since starting in January 2020, has secured >£300k \[E7\] in funding to commercialise NEC@ATI’s IP \[R5\] towards applications such as energy harvesting textiles, leveraging the know\-how developed in the past 6 years on piezoelectric, triboelectric and solar energy harvesting. The company has already created 4 highly skilled industrial jobs and is forecast to have a revenue of £400k in the first year, growing to £1M in 2021 **.** Radical Fibres had one of the highest scoring applications to the Business\-led innovation in response to global disruption \( *de\-minimis*\) to manufacture anti\-viral nanofibre\-based face masks \[E7\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Research by the UWS team in Migration and Ethnic Studies has made significant contributions across policy and practice related to migrant and refugee social inclusion and integration that are of global importance. This committed work, adopting an interconnectedness lens, has engaged with numerous migrant communities: 

 1\) Polish migrant settlement in Scotland and experiences of citizenship and integration 

 2\) Lived realities of HIV\-positive forced migrants from Africa currently living in Scotland 

 3\) Central and Eastern European migrant Roma communities in Scotland and their experiences of racism, exclusion and integration 

 4\) Immigration and Northern Ireland, vis\-à\-vis race relations and hate crime 

 5\) Policing and increased public awareness of human trafficking in Scotland. 
","
 **2. Underpinning Research** 

 Impact on refugee and migrant integration has been achieved through the following five strands of sustained and engaged research work: 

 1\) Trajectories of **Polish migration** and settlement patterns in Scotland and accompanying questions of citizenship and integration, with a focus on education and employment sectors **\[3.1, 3.2\]** 

 2\) The lived realities of **HIV positive refugees from Africa** who are living in Scotland with multiple disadvantages and experiencing high degrees of social exclusion **\[3.3\]** 

 3\) **Roma communities from central and Eastern Europe** and their experiences of everyday racism, socio\-economic in/exclusion and integration in Glasgow **\[3.4\]** 

 4\) Anti\-immigrant **racism in Northern Ireland**, and how a ‘race relations’ framework offers little in terms of the structural factors that reproduce race/class discrimination **\[3.5\]** 

 5\) The **Scottish experience** of raising awareness across communities of the problem **of human trafficking**, and the development of a strategy to tackle this issue **\[3.6\]** 

 Combined, this body of academic work can be synthesised as examining population mobility and experiences of growing vulnerabilities, borders and boundary\-making vis\-à\-vis nationality, ‘race’, ethnicity, community, and welfare rights. The academic outputs problematise the nature of UK public policy and service provision to communities whose precarious citizenship status is often linked to issues of nationality, ‘race’, gender, ethnicity and age. 

 What connects the studies of Polish migrant families **\[3.1, 3.2\]**, Africans in Scotland **\[3.3\]**, Roma communities from central and Eastern Europe **\[3.4\]**, and minorities facing anti\-immigrant racism in Ireland **\[3.5\]**, are shared experiences of multiple vulnerabilities in citizenship, belonging, and everyday racism. The public policy measures and community impact of an important aspect of vulnerable migration, the case of human trafficking, are also considered **\[3.6\]**. 

 Specifically, the research evidence collated via outputs **\[3.1 \- 3.6\]** detail the systems, processes and structures that contribute to migrant and refugee precarious status and sustain *unintegrated* neighbourhoods with evidence of multiple discrimination. In the case of Poles and Roma, outputs **\[3.1, 3.2\]** and **\[3.4\]** illustrate that settlement practices in Scotland are impacted by different migration drivers; gender, age, class, and ethnic composition, as well as the reception offered to the communities, post\-arrival. 

 Similarly, African refugees who are living with HIV in Scotland are said to be ‘living in limbo’ **\[3.3\]** due to their health and immigration status. This photo\-based research, as with **\[3.1\]** and **\[3.4\],** illustrates that racialised ‘othering’ can be challenged via active policy interventions that raise awareness and challenge underlying perceptions. 

 While set within the Scottish context, these concerns are relevant globally and the value of the Northern Ireland work is that tackling anti\-immigrant racism via a dominant ‘race relations’ lens and policy framework is of limited value **\[3.5\].** 

 The underlying research also contributes to a greater awareness of human trafficking, through the prism of ‘invisible crimes’ **\[3.6\].** It recognises the role of transnational networks and how human trafficking has shifted from a peripheral concern to a core issue in Scotland’s political, policing and community safety landscapes. 

 Overall, this body of research **\[3.1 \- 3.6\]** documents how macro level structures of citizenship, identity and representation operate at the meso and micro levels illustrating migrant and refugee experiences of exclusion and integration in Scotland.

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 Collectively, the high\-profile and innovative impact work of the UWS team has assisted in changing perspectives and policies at local, national and international levels. Migrant and refugee integration and inclusion policies and practices are rarely undertaken with ideological neutrality or without political concerns and interventions. As such, migrant and refugee agency and perspectives are foregrounded in the policy and practice impacts of the UWS research team and drive forward staff research and outreach activities. Working in partnership with a range of civil society bodies and Government agencies to deliver socially useful research that helps make a difference is core to such activities. 

 **i\) Promoting self\-representation and agency of migrants and refugees** 

 Sustained impact on refugee policy and practice is demonstrated via the gathered testimonials included as corroborating evidence. Polish community organisations in Scotland, as well as the Scottish Government, have benefited from Pietka\-Nykaza’s research **\[3.1, 3.2**\] as her expertise and knowledge has been translated into well\-regarded evaluation and advocacy tools **\[5.1 \- 5.3\].** For example, her contribution to expert debates on migrant voting rights, as well as contributing to an expert focus group and networking session at the Scottish Parliament, demonstrates that shared knowledge can have meaningful and sustained impact via influencing Scottish Government policy and practice on refugee and migrant integration. Refugees, MSPs and policymakers were informed via Sidhva’s research **\[3.3\]** as this led to the creation of visual mediums that facilitated refugee voices to be seen as well as heard, via travelling photographic galleries and exhibitions in **Scotland, India, South Africa,** and **Jordan**. The high\-profile Scottish Parliament launch of the exhibition generated significant media attention **\[5.4, 5.5\]** Roma rights NGOs \(e.g., Romano Lav\), Glasgow City Council, COSLA \(the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities\) and the Scottish Government \(Equalities Unit\) have all benefited, in a policy and practice sense, from Clark’s long\-term ethnographic research **\[5.4\]** which has emerged from his committed advocacy scholarship work with local Roma communities to ensure their voices are central to their own emancipation, especially for younger members of these disenfranchised communities **\[5.6, 5.7\].** 

 **ii\) Influencing strategies and practices of agencies and organisations working with migrants and refugees** 

 Government and NGO strategies and policies have used the robust evidence base offered by the UWS research team. For example, an evaluation of the provision of integration services to refugees as well as the holistic integration service model has been informed by Pietka\-Nykaza’s **\[5.1 \- 5.3\]** research. **UNFPA/UNICEF** review and adopting new policies on child marriage have been informed by Sidhva’s **\[5.4, 5.5\]** work as an Expert Panel Member on their Global Consultation on ending Child Marriage among Refugees \(Jordan, Feb. 2020\). More inclusive higher education policies and practices for Roma migrant students has resulted from policy advice delivered to the **House of Lords** by Clark **\[5.6, 5.7\]**, as well as via his appointments as Director, Trustee and Advisor, to various UK\-based Roma, Gypsy and Traveller NGOs. Similarly, the NGO Scottish Detainee Visitors \(SDV\) has benefited from Gilligan’s contributions as Board member, and his research has helped shape SDV’s policy approach to refugee detention. Staff have used their research expertise in a manner that assists third\-sector organisations in their strategic planning and policies and practices. 

 **iii\) Awareness raising of issues impacting the everyday lives of migrants and refugees through media/outreach work** 

 High\-profile media attention of UWS research has helped set the public agenda on refugee and migrant integration in Scotland. For example, Sidhva’s ‘Living in Limbo’ photographic exhibition about HIV\+ **African refugees** in Scotland and Pietka\-Nykaza’s work with **Polish migrants** in Scotland, as well as her ongoing work with the **Scottish Refugee Council**. Similarly, Clark’s engagement with **Romanian** and **Slovakian Roma communities** in Scotland has helped families to challenge the continual negative representation by the media and the racism \(Anti\-Gypsyism\) that communities endure. Clark’s ongoing **trustee work with Romano Lav** stands out in this regard, helping to challenge hostile media/political discourses **\[5.7\].** Journalists routinely approach the UWS team for comments or opinion articles on refugee and migrant integration and this helps establish fresh perspectives and new policy ideas for promoting inclusion and belonging. 

 **iv\) Improving the evidence base used by Government and NGOs, regarding migrant and refugee needs from policy and practice** 

 Meaningful impact comes through reliable data and improving the evidence base. Gilligan’s academic work **\[5.5\]** has led to roundtable invitations allowing him to network and disseminate knowledge. Pietka\-Nykaza’s research **\[3.1, 3.2\]** has enabled invitations to high profile events **\[5.1 \- 5.3\]** that assist in transmitting policy and practice guidance to NGOs working in the field of migrant and refugee rights. Sidhva’s commitment to high quality practice\-based work **\[3.3\]** has promoted active exchanges with Government/NGO bodies regarding the needs and expectations of refugees in vulnerable conditions **\[5.4, 5.5\].** Clark’s voluntary engagement with different organisations, including the Scottish Human Rights Commission, the Traveller Movement **\[5.6\]**, Romano Lav \(Roma Voice\) **\[5.7\]** and the Coalition for Racial Equality and Rights **\[5.8\]** has enabled him to offer research evidence **\[3.4\]** to inform the grassroots policy and practice work of these bodies. Atkinson’s innovative research **\[3.6\]** helped to directly shape the policy and strategy of the Scottish Government Taskforce on human trafficking **\[5.9, 5.10\].**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 The Institute of Cancer Research \(ICR\) led clinical radiotherapy fractionation research in prostate cancer that resulted in impact on: 

-  **Clinical practice.** Shorter standard curative radiotherapy regimens have been adopted internationally for patients with prostate cancers, the most common malignancy in men in the UK and other developed nations. 

-  **Patients.** Reduced side effects, less time off work, and savings in travel time and costs without any loss of very high levels of cancer control. 

-  **The economy.** Healthcare systems benefit from reduced treatment costs. Full implementation of the prostate cancer hypofractionation approach could save the NHS approximately GBP28,000,000, and USD360,000,000 in the US annually.

###  2. Underpinning research 

 **Background.** After surgery, radiation therapy remains the most effective way to treat cancer. In the past decades, significant developments have enabled advances in the delivery of radiotherapy to improve the targeting of the X\-ray beam to the cancer while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. In the 1990s, Professor Steve Webb \(ICR Team Leader\) pioneered the technique of intensity modulated radiotherapy \(IMRT\) that adjusts the beam in both shape and intensity, leading to precise high intensity radiation of the tumour reducing irradiation of the surrounding healthy tissues. In 2000, Professor David Dearnaley \(ICR Team Leader\) led the first clinical research study to treat prostate cancer patients with complete IMRT treatments. He then went on to lead the UK national trial to establish the effectiveness high dose prostate radiotherapy **\(Ref. 1\)**. The clinical implementation of IMRT paved the way for the development of new radiotherapy fractionation practices with high dose hypofractionation, where a smaller number of large doses \(called fractions\) are delivered with the potential to improve efficacy and reduce side effects, and to improve the cost\-effectiveness of radiation therapy to benefit both patients and the healthcare services. 

 **Practice\-changing IMRT hypofractionated radiotherapy trials.** As a first step, the ICR alongside its hospital partner The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust \(RM\) combined the developments in IMRT delivery with a hypofractionated treatment approach. Professor Dearnaley, with Professor Emma Hall \(ICR Team Leader\) as the lead statistician, initiated a multicentre, randomised phase 1/2 trial \(CHHiP\) to assess the tolerance and effectiveness of hypofractionated IMRT in prostate cancer. The trial recruited 153 men at 11 UK centres who were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive conventional or two different hypofractionated high\-dose IMRT schedules. The results published in 2012 established that the hypofractionated high\-dose radiotherapy was equally well tolerated as the conventionally fractionated treatment **\(Ref. 2\)**. 

 Subsequently, the ICR led the phase 3 CHHiP trial \(Chief Investigator: Professor Dearnaley; lead statistician: Professor Hall\), the largest completed study undertaken in localised prostate cancer \(3,216 patients\) which showed non\-inferior tumour control for 60Gy in 20 fractions \(3Gy per day\) compared to standard dose\-fractionation \(74Gy in 37 fractions, 2Gy per day\). Hypofractionation gave the opportunity to develop shorter \(20 hospital visits compared with 37\), effective treatments benefitting both radiotherapy resource utilisation and patient convenience **\(Ref. 3\)**. Importantly, patient\-reported outcomes were shown to be favourable across all treatment groups **\(Ref. 4\)** and improved compared with the previously developed high dose radiotherapy techniques in use in the UK. The trial data has been used to develop new dose constraints to improve patient safety **\(Ref. 5\)**. Two CHHiP trial sub\-studies demonstrated the value of using image guide radiotherapy \(IGRT\) which has become the national standard of care **\(Ref. 6\)** and the lower dose of 57Gy in 20 fractions has been shown to be effective in more elderly patients over 75 years of age with improved tolerability and is recommended by NHS England as a standard of care **\(Ref. 7\)**. 

 **Ongoing research in this area.** The new hypofractionated regimen \(60Gy in 20 fractions\) has been further developed to incorporate magnetic resonance imaging \(MRI\)\-directed tumour dose boosts combining IMRT and IGRT in the single institutional DELINEATE study \(ISRCTN04483921\), and is now being assessed in the ICR\-led PIVOTALboost national phase 3 trial \(ISRCTN80146950\). Professor Hall is the scientific lead on the international, multicente phase 3 PACE study aiming at determining if ultra\-hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy \(SBRT\) offers therapeutic benefit over prostatectomy or conventional fractionated or moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 There are approximately 48,500 new prostate cancer cases in the UK annually and since the early 1990s incidence has increased by 41%. UK incidence rates for prostate cancer are expected to rise by 12% between 2014 and 2035 **\[A\]**. Therefore it is a growing healthcare burden, both in the UK and globally. 30% of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer have radiotherapy as part of their primary cancer treatment. Radiotherapy is the most commonly used curative form of therapy in the UK, and development of more effective radiotherapy techniques provides huge opportunities for clinical benefit by increasing survival rates and reducing treatment\-related toxicities. This latter consideration is increasingly important as cancer patients survive longer and live with the long\-term consequences of treatment. 

 **International guidelines/recommendation and international uptake of the improved radiotherapy techniques.** The commissioning policy in 2014 recommended a dose of 74Gy in 37 fractions which was based on the UK national phase 3 dose\-escalation radiotherapy trial **\(Ref. 1\)** led by Professor Dearnaley **\[B\]**. In 2017 the results from the ICR\-led CHHiP phase 3 trial **\(Ref. 2\-7\)** led to the new recommendation by the NHS England Clinical Commissioning Policy that high dose intensity modulated hypofractionated radiotherapy is both safe and effective when delivered giving 60Gy in 20 fractions over a 4\-week period for prostate cancer **\[C\]**. The guidance states that: 

 *“Radiotherapy providers must submit their activity to the national Radiotherapy Dataset \(RTDS\) on a monthly basis. For reporting purposes, it is expected that 70% of prostate cancer patients requiring radical external beam radiotherapy should receive hypofractionated radiotherapy \(i.e., ≤20 fractions of treatment\).”* 

 In addition this guidance mandated the use of IMRT and recommended that IGRT should be used to reduce side effects of high dose radiotherapy based on data from the CHHiP trial. 

 In the UK, the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service \(NCRAS\) has recorded prostate cancer fractionation in the National Radiotherapy Dataset \(RTDS\). There has been an increase in the use of the 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions from 8% in 2012/13 rising to 49% in 2016/17, with a corresponding decrease in the previous standard treatment \(74–78Gy in 37–39 fractions\) from 77% to 26% **\[D\]**. Moreover, the National Prostate Cancer Audits reported that 91% rising to 96% of people in 2019 and 2020, respectively, receiving radical radiotherapy for intermediate\-risk disease had the 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions in combination with androgen deprivation therapy **\[E, F\]**. These data show the increased uptake of this schedule across the UK following the publication of results of the CHHiP trial. 

 In addition, there have been international recommendations of the 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions protocol based on data from the CHHiP trial. The American Society for Radiation Oncology \(ASTRO\), American Society of Clinical Oncology \(ASCO\), and American Urological Association \(AUA\) Evidence\-Based Guideline concluded that the accumulated data are sufficiently robust to justify routine use of 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions protocol in clinical practice. This guideline is endorsed by the Society of Urologic Oncology, the European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology \(ESTRO\), and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists **\[G\]**. In 2019, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence \(NICE\) reviewed the evidence as part of a larger update of their prostate cancer guideline and the committee agreed with the recommendations made by NHS England \(see **\[C\]** \) that 60Gy in 20 fractions was the optimal dose for patients having radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer **\[H\]**. 

 **Patient benefit of the improved radiotherapy techniques.** The CHHiP trial found that long\-term side effects were similar in the hypofractionated groups compared with the conventional group. There were no significant differences in either the proportion or cumulative incidence of side effects 5 years after treatment using clinician\-reported and patient\-reported outcome measures **\(Ref. 4\)**. However, the 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions approach has further benefits for patients as it leads to an average of 17 less hospital visits per patients, reducing time spent attending appointments and reducing patients’ travel costs. It is estimated that 238,906 hours per year are saved for all patients. The benefits of 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions was perhaps best highlighted by a prostate cancer patient himself, whose treatment was influenced by the CHHiP trial: 

 *“I found the 20 sessions of radiotherapy sessions extremely manageable. It was so much better psychologically to ‘get it over and done with’, and in terms of less disruption to my daily life, to have the sessions condensed was great. \[…\]  I have been lucky in a way. I haven’t had any particularly serious side effects from the treatment, and now live a normal life. This is a huge step forward in the development of radiotherapy treatment, it will save the NHS money and cause less disruption for the patient. It would be great if things continue to develop in this way.”* **\[I\]** 

 **Cost saving for the NHS and global healthcare as a result of improved radiotherapy techniques.** Full UK implementation of the CHHiP regimen \(60Gy treatment in 20 fractions\) in prostate cancer is estimated to reduce total treatment fractions and attendances by approximately 200,000 per year with an annual NHS cost saving of GBP28,000,000. The regimen saves 17 hospital trips and complex radiotherapy treatments for each patient, leading to a national reduction of more than 150,000 visits per year **\[D\]**. Prostate cancer radiotherapy accounts for 28% of the workload of radiotherapy departments and the use of hypofractionation is expected to release approximately 13% of capacity, resulting in shorter waiting times and greater availability of radiotherapy resource for other uses. 

 The cost of standard fractionation \(45 or 39 fractions\) in the US is USD26,782 and USD23,625 per patient, respectively. With 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions, the cost is reduced to USD13,402 per patient. Therefore the use of 60Gy treatment in 20 fractions may have the potential to save approximately USD360,000,000 in the US annually without impacting survival or tolerability **\[J\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Organosilicon compounds contain carbon–silicon bonds whose properties, including stability, water repellent abilities, and colourlessness make them widely used in commercial applications. OU research has resulted in new organosilicon compounds for industry using new routes, in high purity, on large scale and reproducibly. One of the high performance liquid chromatography \(HPLC\) columns produced as part of a knowledge transfer protocol \(KTP\) with Hichrom has been selected by the U.S.A Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) as an official FDA analytical protocol, because of its unique selectivity, reliability and reproducibility. This is used to test the purity of a commonly used over the counter drug – Zantac, to reduce risk of carcinogenic impurities and enable sales of the drug. Hichrom has only been able to do this as a result of OU research, and sold around 22,000 columns with income over GBP12,000,000. This subsequently led to a development of new products with chemicals company Cornelius Specialities, road markings specialists WJ Group, technology membership organisation TWI and global chemicals company Johnson Matthey. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 A group at the Open University has been undertaking research in Organosilicon chemistry 

 for over 40 years in a range of areas, including mechanistic and hypervalent silicon chemistry, biological silicon chemistry, synthetic organosilicon chemistry and the synthesis and properties of silsesquioxane cages \(silicon\-oxygen colourless solids with polymeric structures\). The key area of underpinning work related to the impact in the REF period has been the synthesis of organosilicon compounds selectively, in high purity, reproducibly and potentially on a large scale. 

 The organosilicon chemistry developed by the OU group in an academic context can be used to solve a range of specific problems within Industry. Companies have come to the OU to investigate specific problems outside the academic research but with relevant applications. The element silicon is a semimetal and when combined with carbon forms organosilicon compounds. The presence of the silicon atom in the organosilicon compounds leads to unique physical and chemical properties for example, organosilicon compounds \(e.g. silicones\) are used in applications ranging from bath sealants to cupcake trays, as well as body implants, sealants, adhesives, lubricants, personal care products \(Methicone\) and contact lens additives. Their unique chemical reactivity has led to a separate field of study and OU organosilicon chemists have a deep understanding of how these compounds behave chemically and can thus synthesise new organosilicon compounds in high yield and purity. The OU group are world leaders in organosilicon chemistry and have used their knowledge to produce a new class of compound known as silsequioxanes researched hypervalent silicon compounds and developed new chemical transformations using organosilicon compounds. Armed with this unique knowledge of how to make and use organosilicon compounds, the OU group have been able to help a large number of companies develop their products. 

 For example, one of the key intermediates industry has been interested in are trialkoxysilanes, that are often used to coat silica particles. These are the types of compounds used to make the HPLC columns described in the impact statement. Expertise in making such compounds has been developed though making a wide range of trialkoxysilanes for the synthesis of silsesquioxane cages, regular three\-dimensional structures such as cubes and prisms made out of R\-Si\(O\-\)<sub>3</sub> units as shown below \[O1, O2\]: 



 The OU researchers developed a simple route to these compounds from trialkoxysilanes \(RSi\(OEt\)<sub>3</sub>\) using tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride \[O2\]. The pendant R groups provide the materials with a range of properties such as liquid crystals, metal complexing and protein binding \[O3\]. So, in order to make a wide range of different silsesquioxanes the OU group have had to develop a wide range of routes to trialkoxysilanes which can be very water sensitive. Synthesising a new trialkoxysilane requires careful planning through a knowledge of the way these organosilicon compounds react, what to avoid, how to maximise the yield and how to purify the products. For example, one of the key reactions used is known as hydrolsilylation which requires a platinum catalyst. Knowing which type of platinum catalyst to use, which solvent and the reaction conditions is essential to ensure high yields and purity \[O6\]. The OU group have developed a toolbox of key reactions used to synthesise trialkoxysilanes with a wide range of R groups, in the high purity required for the synthesis of silsesquioxanes, which also has wide application in industry. The OU team supplied the characterisation of new materials and analysed their properties on instrumentation not available at the companies. Feedback of this data further improved the synthesis and the properties of these novel materials. 

 The team have gone on to synthesise and characterise a new class of compound where a fluoride ion is trapped in the centre of the cage \[O4\]. Again, they have had to synthesise different alkoxysilanes, this time with electron withdrawing groups, which provided new insights into the way alkoxysilanes are made, handled and reacted \[O5\]. 

 As part of the research into hypervalent silicon compounds and organosilicon compounds in organic synthesis, the researchers have had to carry out other types of reaction such as hydrosilylation, Suzuki coupling and organolithium and Grignard methodologies **\[O6\]**. The expertise in using these reactions to make organosilicon compounds was the basis of KTPs with three different companies, albeit with very different target compounds. For example, whilst Hichrom were focussed on trialkoxysilanes, Cornelius Specialities wanted routes to organosilicon intermediates for use in the contact lens and personal care industries. This led to a toolbox of reactions, based on couplings and organometallics that we had developed as part of our research, which Cornelius Specialities could use to make their targets. WJ needed our methodology and expertise to develop new alterative materials for road marking.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 OU research into the creation and function of organosilicon compounds has created benefit for chemicals companies supplying markets as diverse as pharmaceuticals, personal care, road markings and industrial consultancy for the offshore industry. 

 A collaboration with Hichrom, underpinned by this research, led to the development of High Performance Liquid Chromatography \(HPLC\) columns which are used to demonstrate the safety of the world’s best\-selling drug. Zantac, generically known as ranitidine, is one of the world’s leading treatments of excess stomach acid production. In 2018 nearly 25 million prescriptions were written for ranitidine in the USA and Sanofi, who sell under brand name Zantac, made USD124,000,000 sales in the USA. In September 2019, the USA’s Food and Drug Administration \(FDA\) became aware that an impurity present in some formulations known as *N*\-nitrosodimethylamine \(NDMA\) had potential carcinogenic properties which led to the withdrawal of Zantac from the market **\[C1\]**. In order for pharmaceutical companies to reintroduce Zantac they needed to show that the levels of NDMA were low enough to reduce the risk of cancer. 

 The FDA developed a \(HPLC\) – Mass Spectrometry \(MS\) technique for the analysis of NDMA in ranitidine samples **\[C2\]**. This technique involves separating the individual compounds present in a sample and then analysing them. At the heart of the separation process is an HPLC column, a long column of very small silica particles coated with specific material that promotes the separation of the compounds in the sample. The column chosen by the FDA for their crucial analysis of ranitidine is the Ace C18\-AR column which researchers at the OU created as part of a KTP with Hichrom **\[C2,** line 22 of p.2 and **C3\]**. The column was chosen by the FDA because of its remarkable properties, its stability and its reproducibility. Hichrom was able to produce this novel column as a result of the OU’s expertise in synthesising new organosilicon compounds such as trialkoxysilanes that can be bound to the silica particles and in particular the method of making them in a very pure form, which can be reproduced on a large scale \(with high yields\) without dependence upon a single raw materials supplier **\[O5, O6\]**. This synthetic expertise has been developed over many years of making organosilicon compounds as a result of the research described in section 2. 

 Hichrom had an excellent record of manufacturing reliable and reproducible columns but in 2010 they lacked the expertise to be able to synthesise organosilicon compounds and had to rely on what was commercially available. They approached OU to enter a partnership to produce a new range of HPLC columns and create compounds that their competitors could not. First, they funded a Post\-Doctoral worker for a year to work at the OU and this grew into a three\-year 

 KTP worth GBP200,000 \(2010 – 2014\), which was subsequently classified as outstanding by Innovate UK. The KTP’s aim was to develop new columns that have orthogonal selectivity, that is they have different mechanisms for separating the materials, and thus together create a toolkit for analysis of any mixture. This was successful in that five new columns were produced **\[C4\]** and Hichrom have sold about 22,000 of these columns over the last six years **\[C5**, p.1 **\]**. This has greatly increased in recent years at an average of GBP540 giving a sales value of over GBP12,000,000 **\[C5,** p.2, **C6\]**. The partnership between the OU and Hichrom has continued up to the present day and a Hichrom employee now works on synthesis within the OU group/laboratories. As the then CEO stated in the final KTP report “ *new agile development techniques have speeded up the development of silanes from one every 20 months before the KTP to successfully commercialising 5 in three years*” **\[C7,** p.9 **\]**. In addition, Hichrom’s improved reputation for innovation and reliability has led to acquisition by VWR, part of Avantor **\[C8\]**. 

 The OU team’s research on the synthesis of organosilicon compounds described in Section 2 also led to an approach from Cornelius Specialities. This involved a further KTP \(2013 – 2017, \~GBP200,000\) to develop a toolkit of reactions that could be used to manufacture intermediates on a large\-scale for the contact lens industry **\[C9\]**. Again, the OU’s unique experience of synthesising organosilicon compounds was used to target new, cheaper routes to existing intermediates and to create new compounds \- specifically reliably and in high purity. The company reported that: “ *our novel silicon chemistry toolkit \[…\] enabled us to make a range of existing and new products in high yield and with high purity. Our methodology was specifically designed to ensure we were competitive with price as well*” **\[C8**, p.4 **\]**. Having successfully developed a toolkit for contact lens intermediates, the OU team worked with Cornelius to target the personal care industry as an alternative client base: “ *This has led to a greater understanding of how organosilicon compounds can add value to a range of products such as personal care which will lead to a greater and more varied use of organosilicon compounds in the future*” **\[C8**, p.5 **\]**. 

 As a result of the new opportunities opened up through developing new compounds, 

 “*Cornelius Specialties Ltd \(CSL\) is manoeuvring itself to exploit other market opportunities from silicone materials that it is now able to develop as a result of this partnership*” **\[C8**, p.6 **\]**. 

 The company therefore required additional space to exploit its Engineered Silcones potential and invested GBP240,000 in new plant and machinery **\[C8**, p.10 **\]**. 

 The Welding Institute \(TWI\) is a contract research organization that works for and on behalf of over 700 industrial members in over 4,500 locations world\-wide. TWI and OU have been working together on the development of super hydrophobic coatings, that is surfaces that repel water, based on silica nanoparticles with a specific organosilicon coating. OU and TWI have been focussing on how they can control their processes and produce coatings that are more reproducible with a range of properties. TWI’s Technology Fellow noted: “ *As a result, we gained an insight into how the experimental conditions determined the final structure and material properties of our materials and coatings and we able to increase their hydrophobicity as a result. We were able to go further and apply the expertise developed in the partnership to control the synthesis of silica\-based nanoparticles. This allowed us to control both the size and the surface of the nanoparticles which allows us to influence their material properties and more significantly incorporate the nanoparticles into some of our existing coating materials”* \[ **C9**\]. The partnership with the OU continues to exploit the advances made in synthesising nanoparticles which are being applied to a new project funded by TWI. This applies the new knowledge to make composite materials recyclable through using nanoparticles to control the assembly and, more importantly disassembly. This has the potential to greatly enhance the ability of TWI industrial members to recover and recycle the composite materials they use **\[C9\]**. 

 WJ Group is the UK’s leading specialist road marking business dedicated to permanent and temporary road markings, and other specialist road fixings and surfaces such as road studs, and high friction and safety surfacing. In 2014, OU and WJ Group embarked on a three\-year KTP. As a result, WJ Group acquired a capability to apply road marking products all year round, along with the development of an R&D capability to continue producing high performing cold products with which to enter the GBP750m Northern European market **\[C10,** p.2 **\]**. The KTP reinforced WJ Product’s position as market leader and industry innovator from the sale of hot and cold state\-of\-the\-art products **\[C10,** p.2\]. The Managing Director of WJ Product division noted that the work with the OU ‘ *made a significant contribution to the WJ Groups expansion both in terms of commercial activity and R&D’* and transformed the way the company operates with a ‘ *game\-changing’* methodology for designing and testing new materials giving a rapid go/no go decision when developing new products **\[C11\]**. This has enabled the business to acquire new customers and as a result WJ Group now works with the Dutch equivalent to Highways England; ‘Rijkswaterstaat’. The work has enabled WJ Group to become the ‘go\-to expert’ in micro\-plastics in road markings, enabling them to develop case studies for Highways England investment in more sustainable materials **\[C11\]**. 

 Further work building on this research with Johnson Matthey is developing techniques to recover metals from waste streams, acid mine drainage and wastewater, using silica materials modified with chelates for metals. This enables Johnson Matthey to meet its strategic aims to participate in the increasingly sustainable circular economy. So far, the work has led to novel and commercially applicable materials for which Johnson Matthey is applying for a patent and is also being deployed in the wider company **\[C12\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum of 100 words\) 

 Anaphylaxis to egg was a documented contraindication for the live attenuated influenza vaccine \(LAIV\), produced in eggs. In the USA, asthma was a relative contraindication.  Egg allergy \(with risk of anaphylaxis\) and/or asthma affects over 10% of children, so the impact on national vaccination programmes has been very significant. The SNIFFLE studies were undertaken to generate evidence of the safety of LAIV in children with egg allergy and/or asthma, resulting in changes in vaccine policy, both in the UK \(2015, 2019\) and North America. Following concerns over vaccine efficacy in the USA, the SNIFFLE studies \(and associated mechanistic work\) also generated critical efficacy data to support the ongoing inclusion of LAIV in the UK. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum of 500 words\) 

 Seasonal influenza causes over 500,000 deaths each year. Epidemiological data and mathematical modelling indicate children are the main spreaders of influenza infection; thus, a vaccination programme targeting children provides the most effective method for interrupting transmission and achieving disease control. 

 Annual influenza vaccination for children was introduced to the UK in 2013, using the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine \(LAIV\). However, in common with other influenza vaccines, LAIV is grown in hens’ eggs and contains egg proteins; the vaccine was thus contraindicated for use in children with egg allergy. On the basis of UK 2013 census data, there are over 60,000 egg\-allergic children eligible for vaccination in whom LAIV would be contraindicated. US guidelines further recommended against LAIV in children with recurrent wheeze and asthma \(estimated to affect up to one third of preschool children\), due to limited evidence from a single clinical trial. These contraindications represented significant barriers to achieving successful implementation of the immunisation programme in the UK. Researchers at Imperial College therefore sought to assess the safety of LAIV in children with egg allergy and/or asthma in a series of multicentre, interventional studies. 

 SNIFFLE\-1 \(2013/14\) & SNIFFLE\-2 \(2014/15\) were interventional studies in which 887 egg\-allergic children across 30 paediatric centres in the UK were given LAIV and then monitored for adverse events following vaccination. The studies, led and coordinated by Paul Turner at Imperial College, demonstrated the safety of LAIV in children with egg allergy, with no cases of systemic allergic reaction observed \(1, 2\). The INATE study \(2013/14\) provided further evidence of the safety of LAIV in this cohort by demonstrating that the maximum amount of egg protein in LAIV was some 10\-100 times less than that needed to trigger even the mildest local allergic response in children with egg allergy \(3\). 

 SNIFFLE\-2 also generated reassuring data that the vaccine could be safely used in children with mild\-moderate asthma with well\-controlled symptoms. However, a concern remained as to its safety in children with more significant asthma. The SNIFFLE\-3 study \(2015/16\) was designed to pilot tools to monitor immune response and asthma and generate data to help demonstrate the ongoing efficacy of LAIV in the UK \(4,5\). This was essential due to data from USA that efficacy of the vaccine may have fallen from >85% pre\-2009 to <5% in 2015/16 season. In SNIFFLE\-4 478 children were recruited across 14 UK centres nationally, to assess the safety of LAIV in children with severe asthma. The study confirmed that the vaccine can be safely used in children with asthma across the severity spectrum \(6\). 

 Imperial College were the central coordinating site for the studies, as well as host institution for Dr Turner, who wrote the protocols and established a new research network in order to carry out the study. SNIFFLE\-1 and \-2 were also facilitated by co\-chief investigator Dr Erlewyn\-Lajeunesse of University Southampton Hospitals. Members of the National Vaccine Evaluation Committee \(NVEC\) at Public Health England \(Lead, Prof Elizabeth Miller\) contributed to all 4 studies in terms of study support and data analysis.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum of 750 words\) 

 These Imperial\-led studies have resulted in policy changes to the annual ‘flu vaccination programme in the UK, facilitating uptake amongst pre\- and primary school age children and contributing to uptake of over 60% in the UK paediatric population. 

 Following review of the SNIFFLE\-1 and \-2 studies by the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation \(JCVI; an independent expert advisory committee which provides advice to the UK Departments of Health on matters pertaining to immunisation\) in June 2015, JCVI recommended changes to UK vaccine guidance whereby the contraindication of egg allergy was effectively removed. This facilitated the roll out of seasonal influenza vaccination in UK children \[ **A**; see page 4, point 12; **B**; see page 19\]. A similar process was followed for SNIFFLE\-4 in 2019, resulting in further changes in guidance with respect to children with asthma \[ **B**; see page 18; and **C**; see pages 13\-14\]. The guidance now states, as a result of the SNIFFLE\-4 data, “ *children with asthma on inhaled corticosteroids may safely be given LAIV, irrespective of the dose prescribed*” \[ **C**; see page 18\]. Importantly, this has resulted in a shift towards use of LAIV in children of all ages with asthma. Given the evidence that LAIV induces a higher level of immunity than injected influenza in children, this shift may offer better protection to older children with asthma. 

 Changes in practice were further reinforced through presentations at a number of national and international meetings. Public Health England \(PHE\) have credited the SNIFFLE studies as having been one factor facilitating the roll\-out of LAIV amongst eligible children, achieving uptake exceeding 60% \[ **D**: see page 4\]. 

 While there was emerging evidence from the UK and Canada that injected influenza vaccines are safe in children with egg allergy, evidence was lacking for LAIV. Thus, egg\-allergic children in USA could only be offered the injected vaccine. Data generated from SNIFFLE\-1 and \-2 studies were also presented to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\), the USA’s health protection agency, in turn resulting in a change in US and Canadian guidance \[ **E, F, G**; see section new developments\] whereby LAIV is no longer contraindicated for the majority of egg\-allergic children, and so “ *Persons reporting symptoms other than hives after exposure to egg \(such as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or recurrent emesis; or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention\) may also receive any licensed and recommended influenza vaccine \[including LAIV\] that is otherwise appropriate*” \[ **E**\]. 

 SNIFFLE\-3 and SNIFFLE\-4 studies generated biological samples \(nasal swabs, saliva and serum samples\) that were used by both Imperial College London researchers and PHE to assess the response to changes in vaccine strains included in LAIV. This was due to concerns in the USA, which had reported that vaccine efficacy might have fallen from >85% pre\-2009 to <5% in 2015/16 season, and led to a change in the strains included for the 2017/18 season. The collaboration between Imperial and PHE allowed the collection of biological samples from patients participating in the SNIFFLE and FLUSHED studies \(also run at Imperial\), which facilitated further mechanistic work evaluating both vaccine efficacy and local mucosal immunity following LAIV \[ **H, I**\]. These results contributed to the assessment by the UK’s JCVI that LAIV continued to demonstrate efficacy \(midseason vaccine efficacy in 2018/19 of 87%\) \[ **C**\], thus supporting the ongoing use of LAIV in the UK’s National Immunisation Programme.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Flooding and pollution are increasing worldwide. Urbanisation and climate change are producing insecure, degraded ecosystems. Coventry University \(CU\) has pioneered research in Sustainable Drainage Systems \(SuDS\) that has revolutionised the way infrastructure and ecology can combine. Our work has discovered new ways to deactivate pollution, enhanced ecology and assisted world\-famous sporting icons. Our research has guided sector expertise for practitioners draining catchments, resulting in landscape transformation. Informed by CU work, over 100 km<sup>2</sup> of permeable paving \(PP\) has been installed in the UK alone, since conception. Marshalls paving, for example, have applied CU’s contribution to SuDS development globally, installing 5 million m<sup>2</sup> of PP since 2014. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 SuDS research at CU has aimed to discover and improve measures that facilitate rainfall soaking into the ground, rather than running off and generating flooding. Once the water is below ground, work has investigated ways to remove pollutants, deactivating toxins in\-situ by microbiological processes. The innovative nature of the research has led to numerous collaborations with partners including the EU, Highways England, charities and SMEs. In 2003, CU researchers were first to identify the importance of biology in engineered SuDS, which could improve pollution prevention properties in engineered permeable pavement \(PP\) \(R1\). Research in this area, focussed on microbiological remediation of pollution in stormwater, contaminated from urban and industrial runoff, continues to the present day \(R5\). 

 In a KTP beginning in 2004 \(G1\), Coupe was the first to investigate the impact of herbicides on PP and from 2012\-15, work on herbicides in SuDS was advanced by Mbanaso, Charlesworth and Coupe, working with Interpave, a major UK paving and landscaping trade body. Research demonstrated that herbicides brought considerable environmental risk to SuDS; researchers documented methodologies for \(and tested the feasibility of\) deactivating the much\-used herbicide Roundup, within these systems \(R2\). 

 CU research also established that pollution in water and gases can be remediated by SuDS. From 2011\-2014, Newman, Coupe and Mbanaso investigated the potential application of SuDS for landfill gas remediation, working with the company SEL Environmental. Landfill produces methane, a greenhouse gas, from waste disposal. Research assessed how SuDS could be used to soak up harmful gases, to vent explosive gases away from nearby buildings. Coupe and Newman showed how this technology could combine with stormwater recovery to both reduce flood risk and provide treatment sites for removing urban contaminants \(R3\). 

 From 2014\-16 Marshalls sponsored a £100,000 programme of research \(G2\), led by Coupe and Sañudo Fontaneda, to examine the benefits of new PP designs and new paradigms on water quality, whilst supporting risk analysis on disposal of SuDS after use \(R4\). Pollution receptors inside SuDS are not inert, but strongly biologically active, with microbial communities that remove biodegradable material and toxic non\-biodegradable metals by biological interaction. This work is being continued in the CU contribution to a 30 partner, 15 university, €3.8m Marie Curie ITN project led by Coupe, named SAFERUP\! \(R5\). 

 Since 2017, field\-scale green infrastructure devices were tested onsite at CU by Sañudo Fontaneda, Lashford and Coupe \(2020\), with research on swales \(R6\) and green roofs. Green roof work was led by Coupe and Trenchard in a Knowledge Transfer Partnership \(G3\), proving the potential for green roofs to enhance insect and plant biodiversity \(2017\-2019\). 68 plant species were established on a retrofitted green roof incorporating the SEL/Permavoid blue green roof design beneath, replicating a wildflower meadow. Beneficial ecological function is shown in SuDS microbiological action, including bioremediation and in our new blue and green roof designs that demonstrably facilitate biodiversity. Discovery and elucidation of beneficial biological action in engineered stormwater infrastructure, is unique to CU SuDS, explaining the novelty of our work and enthusiasm of funders to collaborate.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 CU researchers have worked extensively with industry to bring new knowledge to SuDS, enabling the effective integration of these techniques into drainage designs. Introducing paving surface permeability and plants to SuDs, has resulted in tangible impacts on companies working with CU; this has been both in terms of product development and compliance, benefiting the downstream environments \(please see the chart below for a summary of impact flow\). 



 A major project has been the development of permeable pavement, an innovative drainage solution, which CU was involved in from the earliest stages. The journey began through the creation of a joint patent with the company Formpave in 2000, the first move to establish PP in a way that replaced traditional, often inadequate pipe and gully drainage. The UK Committee on Climate Change stated that during 2009\-13, “an estimated 5,100,000m<sup>2</sup> \(510 ha\) of permeable paving was installed in England” \- 8% of the total area of block paving \(S1, p.1\).  The market has grown since then, led by Marshalls, the UK’s largest SuDs installer; since 2014 they have generated a profit of £14 million based on turnover of £2.5 billion, of which £500 million is in permeable paving \(S3\).  They alone were responsible for installation of 5,000,000 m<sup>2</sup> of PP during 2014\-2020, which has led to around 1,500,000 m<sup>3</sup> of stormwater being diverted from the UK’s overloaded and flood prone sewer network. Marshalls observed the success of improving water quality in their offer, changing their design to include filtering geotextiles, after research at CU \(S2\). Explaining the impact of CU research in 2020, Marshalls head of SuDS said: “we lead the market because of this relationship with Coventry University…the collaboration with CU helps us in staying at the front of the sector. Coventry University is the only institution that we have active research with” \(S3, S10\). 

 CU and SEL Environmental have collaborated since 2000. CU research rigorously tested the properties of the Permavoid module, a key water storage element, found in all SEL designs since its initial development. SEL’s managing director, stated that Permavoid\-related products, drawing on this research, make up 60% of total sales for the company, who in 2019 had a turnover of £2 million \(S5\). 

 He noted that much of the SEL collaboration with CU, “related to Permavoid systems and the many ways that they can be deployed, to attenuate water, gases and pollution \(and\) has been fundamental to our technical and commercial development as a company. As described in the case study, we have won many drainage and gas migration installations due to our collaboration with Coventry University” \(S5,S10\). 

 As acknowledged above, CU research revealing new SuDS properties has been invested in product development, generating new designs, new products and impact in the environmental sector. Testing of Permavoid at CU has inspired a range of new patented SEL drainage products, brought to market from 2004\-2020. Of these, SEL have sold kilometres of novel linear drainage and water treatment products including Permaceptors, Permachannels and virtual curtain explosive gas migration barriers, with 50 UK schemes \(S5\). 



 Permavoid drainage is now used at Tottenham football stadium \(2019\) and the refurbished Anfield Stadium, Liverpool \(2017, pictured above\), where it prevents match postponement for a combined 2.2m supporters per annum – a significant cultural impact \(S9\). The Chief Executive Office of the Institute of Groundmanship attributes Liverpool’s 2019\-20 Premier League title win in part to the “revitalised pitch benefits” delivered through the CU\-informed Permavoid design, which contributed to their achievement of “100 points from their last 102 available on offer at home” \(S9\). Permavoid systems drain 161,860 m<sup>2</sup> of sports pitches in the UK alone representing 5 sports \(S5, S8\). 

 SEL used CU research on gas migration prevention technology to develop gas protection schemes, protecting human life from explosions arising from landfill gases leaking into buildings, and enabling regeneration of difficult environments. Using CU\-trialled Permavoid design criteria to separate methane and water, in 2017, SEL vented gases from a site in Warrington, allowing safe construction of an £11,850,000 development: 104 low\-rise dwellings, roads and parking. \(S4\). This achievement also built on our original publication \(R3\). SEL have installed Permavoid in 9 countries: UK, Ireland, USA, Bahrain, Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Belgium, Poland \(S5\). 



 The KTP project with SEL from 2017 – 2019, demonstrated ecological impact, placing retrofit green roofs onto existing infrastructure \(pictured above\). Research has enabled better water management alongside habitat enhancement \(S6,\). An independently conducted ecological survey revealed 5 insect species with national and local rarity value, from a total of 120 insect species on the green roofs at Coventry University \(S7\). The innovation in green roofs improved and increased the total constructed habitat for rare insects \(S6\).  This research has been incorporated into SEL’s product range, where green roofs are now used across four sites in Coventry, London, Aylesford and Blackburn.

1.  **Summary of the impact** 

 UofG research produced internationally recognised tools, guidance and evidence on coastal erosion for Scottish Government and its agencies. This included the award\-winning DynamicCoast, that shows coastal erosion has risen by 39% since the 1970s, with 20% of Scotland’s coastal homes \(GBP524 million\) now at risk. Scottish Government, its agencies, and businesses, use this research to design and implement policies that address coastal erosion, assess risk and achieve their statutory flood, erosion, climate change and adaptation obligations. These adaptation plans, climate\-resilient planning and marine licensing decisions have improved the resilience of Scotland’s coastal communities and assets. In 2020 DynamicCoast was acknowledged by the Scottish Government as their stimulus for GBP12 million investment in new central funding for Coastal Change Adaptation. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 UofG research has provided the evidence base, tools and guidance to allow local and national government to respond to the risk posed by coastal erosion and erosion\-related flooding \(hereafter, coastal erosion\). The research has established that 19% \(3,802km\) of Scotland’s 20,000km coast is soft and increasingly vulnerable to coastal erosion as sea levels rise, negatively impacting both the coast and the assets and communities behind. This puts at risk more than 9,000 buildings, 500km of roads, 300km of water supply lines, 60km of rail track, and vital airport runways that are currently protected by natural defences \(e.g. beaches/dunes\). 

 Since 2011, UofG coastal geomorphology has involved fieldwork, modelling and Geographic Information System \(GIS\) analysis of sea level rise and erosion rates across Scotland. These underpinned the development of a pan\-Scotland coastal erosion and flooding susceptibility model \[Ref 3.1\], supported by an Engineering and Physical Sciences \(EPSRC\) Collaborative Award in Science and Engineering PhD studentship \(Fitton, 2011–2015\) with Scottish Natural Heritage \(SNH\), that modelled the natural susceptibility of the Scottish coast to erosion \[Ref 3.1\]. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency \(SEPA\), recognising its lack of tools to assess the national risk of coastal erosion, supported Hansom \(PI\) and Fitton \(RA\) to further develop this work and produce a national Coastal Erosion Susceptibility Model \(CESM\). This identified assets vulnerable to coastal erosion, to allow more effective management at multiple statutory policy levels across Scotland. 

 Recognising the potential of the UofG CESM model, Scottish Government \(SG\) commissioned Hansom \(PI\), Fitton \(RA\) and SNH/SG coastal erosion coordinator \(Rennie\) to develop a national coastal change assessment \(NCCA, now called DynamicCoast;  [www.dynamiccoast.com](http://www.dynamiccoast.com/)\), an evidence\-based GIS for SG and its agencies to assess coastal risk \[Ref 3.2\]. DynamicCoast used 2,000 maps and 1 million data points to provide a detailed risk assessment of the vulnerability of Scotland’s coast. 

 DynamicCoast \[Ref 3.2\] identified \~3,300 homes with a combined value of GBP524 million at high risk of erosion. Notably, the work established that, since the 1970’s, the erosion extent has increased by 39% with a doubling of the average erosion rate to 1m per year, compared to the period 1890’s to 1970’s \[Ref 3.2\]. Due to the impact of DynamicCoast \[3.1\-3.3\], SG funded \(via Scotland's Centre of Expertise for Waters \(CREW\)\) Hansom \(PI\) and Naylor \(Co\-I\) to deliver DynamicCoast2 \(2018–2021\). This modelled anticipated future coastal change to enable the development of accurate risk and adaptation plans for those communities most vulnerable to coastal erosion. 

 In parallel with the above, Naylor and Hansom collaborated with Arup to assess climate change risks in the Firth of Clyde for SNH \[Ref 3.4\] and, later in 2016, with the City of Edinburgh by adding coastal actions to the “Edinburgh Adapts” Action Plan. Further evidence of UofG coastal geomorphology expertise is Naylor’s co\-lead on “Stormy Geomorphology”, an international research initiative that identified the impact of climate change on landscapes and society \[Ref 3.5\]. A Belmont Forum/Natural Environment Research Council \(NERC\) project \(2013–2017\) allowed Naylor to identify social and political influences on climate change adaptation, and policy windows to support coastal adaptation \[Ref 3.6\] through a NERC \(2015–2019\) Knowledge Exchange fellowship. Naylor leads the adaptation component of DynamicCoast2 and has led the EPSRC IAA\-funded Edinburgh Downscaling project \(2019–2020\), which combined \[Ref 3.1, 3.2, 3.3\] to create an Urban Coastal Erosion Susceptibility Model \(U\-CESM\).

1.  **Details of the impact** 

 UofG research has delivered evidence\-based tools that enable national and local governments, and their agencies, to implement policies that address coastal erosion and assess risk. This has catalysed a step change in coastal erosion policy, strategy and practice, improving the future resilience of coastal communities and assets \[5.1a\(i\)\]. The reach of DynamicCoast is global: 65,440 website hits and 16,660 users from 105 countries since August 2017 \( [dynamiccoast.com](http://dynamiccoast.com/)\). 

 **A. Changes to National Policy:** UK government requires 5\-yearly Climate Change Risk Assessments \(CCRAs\) under the UK Climate Change Act, with “ *CCRA1 noted the absence of coastal change analysis* between historical mapping and modern datasets” \[5.1c, p33\]. UofG research addressed this key evidence gap, producing tools which allow policy makers better manage those risks. The Scottish Government has, through both the Scottish Climate Change Adaptation Programme \(SCCAP\) \[5.1b\] and SCCAP2, used UofG research \[3.3\] to identify the coastal erosion risks noting that *“…GBP1 billion roads, GBP 2 billion railway line and GBP0.5 billion housing within land…susceptible to coastal erosion*”. They also confirm that UofG’s tools allow the Scottish Government to better manage these risks: “ *Use the \[Coastal Erosion Susceptibility Model\] CESM for Scotland to inform Flood Risk Management Plans*” \[5.1d, §N2\-20, p55\]. Thus, UofG research has addressed these evidence gaps, enabling production of “ *the first full assessment of \[Scotland’s\] coastal vulnerabilities”* \[5.1b\]. UofG research has driven Scottish Government’s decision to invest GBP12 million \[5.1a\(1\)\] in new central funding for coastal change adaptation. The UK Parliament’s Preparing for Climate Change Progress Report states “ *NCERM data are not available in an easy\-to\-use format; Scotland’s Dynamic website shows that this is possible, and a similar approach should be adopted in England*” \[5.1e\]. Internationally, Ireland’s statutory adaptation plans recommend DynamicCoast as “ *best\-practice exemplar that Ireland can follow*” \[5.1f\]. 

 **B. Changes to Regional/Local Policy:** The UofG CESM \[3.2\] is used by SG agencies \[5.2−5.3\] responsible for flooding \(SEPA\), marine \(Marine Scotland\), nature \(SNH\), historic environment \(Historic Environment Scotland, HES\) and 25 \(of 32\) local authorities. HES and SNH use DynamicCoast to underpin technical guidance for the historic environment \[5.3a\] and in national advice for planners \[5.3b\]. SEPA has embedded UofG\-developed outputs \[3.1, 3.3\] into flood webmaps \(NSCE maps\) to *“inform which actions are likely to be more sustainable to manage coastal flood risk… \(and\)…inform strategic advice provided by SEPA.*” \[5.2a\]\). Indeed *“As coastal erosion and flooding are interlinked, they must be considered jointly. SEPA has used outputs from the Dynamic Coast project to inform the second National Flood Risk Assessment published in December 2018”* \[5.2c, §2.3\]. 

 DynamicCoast and the NSCE maps enable SEPA to fulfil statutory legislative requirements previously unaddressed \(§19\-21 2009 Flood Risk Management \(Scotland\) Act\), impact recognised by the Scottish Knowledge Exchange Award’s ‘Spotlight’ prize in 2019 \[5.4\]. SEPA’s Head of Hydrology and Flooding notes: *“Dynamic Coast data and analysis is highly relevant to the appraisal of actions to address flood risk…”* \[5.2b, pg2\]; underpinned by these coastal erosion data, flood risk appraisals are more robust and improve future community and infrastructure resilience. 

 Four Local Authorities \(Ayrshire, Fife, Moray and Highland\) have used DynamicCoast for coastal erosion and climate change risk assessment within Shoreline Management Plans \(SMP\), with more expected to follow \[confirmed by 5.5 and the Scottish Government Managing Flood Risk Team, 5.1a\(i\)\]: *“The Dynamic Coast project has had a truly transformative impact…in support of our local communities….* *Awareness of the risks identified within these maps is essential as Scotland embarks on resilience and adaptation planning along asset\-rich shores….’* \[5.1a\(i\)\]. 

 Through her Knowledge Exchange fellowship, Naylor was able to influence policy at city and regional scale in Scotland \(Adaptation Scotland and Clyde Marine Planning Partnership\) and England. UofG coastal actions, within Edinburgh’s climate change adaptation plan, allow statutory climate change adaptation duties to be met \[5.5d\]. Coastal policy in the Clyde Marine Plan \[5.5e\(ii\), Chapter 4\] are UofG\-driven, confirmed by the Marine Plan Manager \[5.5e\(i\)\]: UofG *“coastal research* \(\[3.2\]; \[3.4\]\) *has been a key input to allow us to develop… those aspects relating to sea\-level rise, coastal processes and adaptation management…*’. 

 **C. Changes to government/industry practice improving coastal resilience:** DynamicCoast has driven practice\-change within SG agencies. Marine Scotland’s License Operations Team \(MS\-LOT\) use DynamicCoast to ensure marine license compliance with the Marine \(Scotland\) Act 2010 \[5.3c\]: *“DynamicCoast maps have enabled MS\-LOT to more easily consider the potential impacts to or from coastal erosion. It has become standard practice to review the maps when considering applications for dredging”*, such as at Montrose \[5.6, pp43–44\]. 

 Statutory consultee, SEPA, used DynamicCoast to prevent a substantial housing development in an erosion risk site, placing it on indefinite hold \[5.2d, §1.5\]: *“Dynamic Coast was referenced in our consultation response for a proposed residential and leisure development at Ardersier, Nairn”* \[5.2b, p3\]. In Edinburgh, UofG research \[3.2, 3.3, 3.6\] underpins the business case for creating a coastal park and landward relocation of a 3,500\-house regeneration project \[5.5d\(i\)\]. 

 Coastal businesses also directly use DynamicCoast; world\-renowned golf courses such as St. Andrews use UofG data to plan repairs and/or improve climate\-resilient business continuity \[5.7\]. Energy infrastructure is now more resilient: landfalls from proposed offshore renewables were moved to a risk\-free site, eg: *“Moray Council uses DynamicCoast to inform future development...important in reducing the risk of inappropriate development”* \[5.5c\(i\)−\(ii\)\]. Such changes improve business sustainability by better managing coastal erosion risks and reducing future costs. 

 **D. Integration of research methodology into National Practice:** In 2017, Ordnance Survey Ltd \(OS\) adopted DynamicCoast’s innovative methodology to change its data attributions and protocols, improving the accuracy of its tidal surveying \[5.8\]. Mean High Water Springs \(MHWS\) constitute the legal land registry boundary underpinning coastal title in Scotland, and DynamicCoast has ensured challenge\-free OS tideline positions. This is confirmed by the Managing Director, National Mapping Services \[see 5.8\]: *“These tidal updates greatly enhance the robustness of other key OS products such as Boundary\-Line, which represents the hierarchy of administrative and electoral boundaries in England, Scotland and Wales and supports a wide range of government and business decisions.”* Dynamic Coast change in Scotland *‘informed the need for a targeted GB\-wide coastal revision programme. As a result…OS…update\(d\) 5,700km of MHWS and associated geographic features in England and Wales to December 2020”* \[5.8\]. Marine Scotland’s Licensing Operations Team noted: *“An additional benefit of the work of DynamicCoast has been the updating of the position of MHWS…This allows MS\-LOT to provide better advice…when marine licences are required”* \[5.3c\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Based on fundamental research into engineered microfluidic systems the Centre for Research in Biodetection Technologies \(CRBT\) at the University of Hertfordshire \(UH\) has worked with government and industry to design, develop and optimise novel biodetection systems that detect, collect and analyse airborne toxins, bacteria and viruses. These technologies have delivered a ‘ *significant leap*’ in the UK Government’s capability to defend armed forces and civilians against biological attacks. CRBT research underpinned both the design and evaluation of the award\-winning Biological Surveillance and Collector System, delivered by an industry consortium led by Thales Group. It was signed into service for use by the Royal Air Force to protect British troops overseas and adapted into an export product for use in public venues for civilian protection. This contract, involving 26 companies, \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\]. CRBT applied similar microfluidics principles to food security, working with industry to develop and commercialise a unique early warning system that identifies crop disease. The capabilities of the SporeSentry system have been made compatible with Fera Science’s CropMonitor Pro platform, run by the Crop Health And Protection \(CHAP\) centre which provides real\-time data on disease prevalence to farmers and growers in the UK. The data gathered by CropMonitor Pro also feeds into the National Reference Collection. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 For high\-risk scenarios requiring early warning, such as biowarfare detection or disease monitoring, the ultimate goal is highly sensitive, real\-time, *in situ* biological analysis. But the ability to deliver near\-instantaneous information has long been constrained by hardware limitations associated with the time required to capture, process and assess biological targets. This is a particular problem in challenging military environments where speed is of the essence in order to maintain operational tempo and take decisions to limit the number of casualties and fatalities. Multidisciplinary research within CRBT has combined expertise in microfluidics, sample processing and handling, airborne collection and detection technologies, and integrated system design to engineer hardware capable of providing repeatable, reliable and rapid biological identification. 

 Microfluidics is the study of miniaturised devices that can manipulate and control the flow of very small volumes of fluid using engineered channels often measuring hundredths of a millimetre. Addressing both engineering and microbiological challenges, CRBT studies have shaped the development of novel microfluidic devices and their integration into portable, autonomous systems that can collect airborne particles, process them into liquids at the microscale and identify the presence of harmful pathogens. This work began in the early 2000s when a group led by Tracey studied real\-time image processing of red blood cells flowing through the group’s own designed silicon\-glass microfluidic devices. The researchers extracted biophysical data for analysis and demonstrated reliable measurements of thousands of blood cells in cross\-section channels measuring around three micrometres. This provided new insight into how microfluidic components could be integrated into novel diagnostic instruments and designed to handle biological cells without damaging them. It led to the development of Micro Throttle Pumps capable of pumping undiluted, anticoagulated human venous blood; micropumping of whole blood represents a rigorous real\-world test of cell suspension transport given blood’s high cell content and the relative fragility of red blood cells \[ **3.1**\]. 

 These studies provided the theoretical underpinnings for a number of subsequent projects funded by Defence Science and Technology Laboratory \(Dstl\) to develop proof\-of\-principle microfluidics systems for operational use in relation to the detection of biowarfare agents. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] \[ **G1**\]. The CRBT group demonstrated the efficacy of microfluidic structures in the rapid, selective separation of microparticles from larger samples in order to detect pathogenic microorganisms \[ **3.2**\]. They also provided new insights into the mechanical properties of a polydimethylsiloxane elastomer commonly used for fabricating microfluidic devices \[ **3.3**\]. 

 \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] Dstl sought to develop a wearable personal sampler system that could provide the military with a wider area biological monitoring capability, supplying information on who has been infected, what they have been infected with and their level of exposure. A key research challenge lay in ensuring the concentration of the liquid sample presented to the sensor was sufficiently high for detection, which required the system to produce a small output liquid volume. Under a four\-year framework agreement worth £1.42m to UH \[ **G2**\], a CRBT\-Dstl collaboration developed a prototype digital microfluidics \(DMF\) platform based on an electrowetting\-on\-dielectric \(EWOD\) approach and electrostatic precipitation; it was capable of recovering target material and producing microlitre highly concentrated droplet samples \[ **3.4**\]. The CRBT group identified the effectiveness of a superhydrophobic material as the coating for the actuation surfaces in the EWOD\-based DMF devices; it was found to reduce the common issue of ‘biofouling’ \(contamination\) of the actuation surface \[ **3.5**\]. 

 Concurrently, the CRBT researchers applied these fundamental microfluidics principles to the field of food security; specifically, the development of a unique early warning system that could detect airborne fungal pathogens in cereal crops. Through £250,000 in funding from BBSRC and Innovate UK \[ **G3**\], the group, in collaboration with commercial partners, led the development of the underpinning technology for the first autonomous spore\-sampling system, intended for use by farmers and growers. At the end of both grants \[ **G2**, **G3**\], the CRBT group published its bespoke DMF immunoassay platform that demonstrated, for the first time on an EWOD chip, rapid, efficient and specific detection of four types of pathogen – proteins, vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores and viruses \[ **3.6**\]. This demonstrated its applicability to both biowarfare and crop disease detection.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Microfluidic devices and systems developed at UH have had an impact in the fields of biowarfare, counter terrorism, and food security. CRBT research has made a fundamental contribution to the technological development of the next generation of biodetection systems, advancing the UK’s defence capabilities. It led to the development and deployment of a novel biodetection system that is used by the Royal Air Force \(RAF\) to protect British troops overseas from biological attacks and that was adapted into an export product for civilian use; the production of this system was of significant benefit to the UK economy. The research underpinned the development of novel diagnostic device SporeSentry, which identifies pathogenic spores that can cause crop disease; the UK\-wide CropMonitor Pro platform has been made compatible with SporeSentry. 

 **Protecting UK armed forces overseas and civilians from biological attacks, enhancing the UK’s defence capabilities and delivering economic impact** 

 The UK’s 2015 National Security Risk Assessment highlighted the risk of biological \(and chemical\) attacks against the UK or its armed forces, and the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear \(CBRN\) technology to state and non\-state actors \[ **5.1**\]. The development of biological detection systems that can be fielded by the UK armed forces is ‘ *a high priority*’ for the Ministry of Defence \[ **5.1**\]. Based on several studies, including the collaborative microfluidics research with CRBT \[ **3.1**\- **3.3**\], Dstl’s strategic approach to bio\-surveillance led to the MOD issuing a commercial tender in 2014, for the development of a system that could rapidly detect the presence of hazardous aerosolised biological materials to protect military and civilian personnel \[ **5.2**\]. CRBT research had an important role in shaping the technical specification of the call \[ **5.2**\]. An industry consortium of 26 organisations, led by Thales Group and including Williams Advanced Engineering won the contract \[ **5.2**\- **5.5**\]. On the advice of Dstl, Thales approached UH, the only academic institution involved, to apply CRBT expertise, based on their published research and previous collaborations with Dstl, to the experimental work, engineering design and performance optimisation, and final evaluation \[ **5.2**, **5.3**\]. 

 The result was the Biological Surveillance and Collector System \(BSCS\), which comprised a number of pathogen collection platforms, and a sample processing and identification laboratory. BSCS was signed into service having achieved full operating capability in November 2017, to be operated by the RAF; the BSCS was highlighted as a key project in the 2018\-2021 Corporate Plan for Defence Equipment and Support, which supports the UK’s Strategic Command \[ **5.4**\]. The RAF Air Commodore, who was responsible for the delivery of the system into service, said at the time: ‘ *BSCS is a critical capability for our deployed forces in an uncertain world. Asymmetric Warfare has presented CBRN \(chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear\) challenges, the most recent of which being the chemical attacks in Syria \- the biological threat to our forces is no less critical* \[ **5.5**\].’ The RAF Wing Commander overseeing the regiment that operates the BSCS said: ‘ *The superb degree of confidence provided by BSCS is game changing and will allow commanders to take action in a timely manner to maximise the protection of our people* \[ **5.5**\].’ 

 The BSCS won a Minister for Defence Procurement Acquisition Award in November 2017. Harriet Baldwin MP, the Minister at the time, commented: “ *The Biological Surveillance and Collector System \(BSCS\) is a cutting\-edge piece of kit that uses innovative technology to protect our troops from biological attacks through using specialist sensors to detect incoming threats. In the last year we spent £18.7bn with industry to support programmes like this to keep our troops safe in some of the most hostile environments* \[ **5.6**\].’ The BSCS was also adapted into an export product for civilian use. Called Spinnaker, it is designed to protect sporting events, critical national infrastructure and large\-scale public gatherings. An article on the Thales website reported: ‘ *Thales’s Spinnaker has bio\-monitoring capability, with a mobile laboratory to ensure fast analysis of potential threats*.’ It said that such CBRN systems are ‘ *proving invaluable in civilian scenarios and increasingly procured by Government departments for domestic security*’ \[ **5.7**\]. 

 The development of the BSCS delivered significant benefits to the wider UK economy. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\] comprising a supply chain of 26 organisations, the majority of which were UK\-based and 17 of which were SMEs \[ **5.3**\]. \[TEXT REDACTED FOR PUBLICATION\]. Independent consultancy Oxford Economics, in its report ‘ *The Contribution of Thales to the UK Economy*’ \(March 2019\), highlighted BSCS as a case study to demonstrate the company’s ‘ *multiplier impacts*’ and the fact that Thales ‘ *enables partners to contribute to large contracts, in turn supporting further supply chain activity among their suppliers*’ \[ **5.8**\]. There were also reputational benefits for the companies involved. Thales was able to highlight the BSCS in its own marketing and PR campaigns, including the marking of the 100th anniversary of the RAF in July 2018 \[ **5.9**\]. Williams Advanced Engineering cited the BSCS and the ministerial award in a case study of how it ‘ *specialises in complex technological problem solving and bringing Formula One technology and processes to industry*’ \[ **5.9**\]. 

 Dstl’s decision to invest £1.42m in a research collaboration with UH between 2014 and 2018 \[ **G2**\] was driven by the need to further advance state\-of\-the\-art biodetection technologies that could increase the speed and efficiency of operations in the field \[ **5.1**\]. The collaboration resulted in the development of two highly portable, compatible prototype systems: a wearable electrostatic precipitator system for collection of airborne biological material \[ **3.4, 3.5**\] and a digital microfluidic platform for sample recovery and concentration of collected biological material \[ **3.6**\]. Dstl reported that the technologies resulted in three patent applications, ‘ *demonstrated their potential to be highly innovative’* in both military and civilian contexts and delivered ‘ *a significant leap in capability’* in relation to biological surveillance \[ **5.1**\]. 

 **Commercialisation of an early warning crop disease detection system to alert farmers and growers and strengthen food security** 

 The idea to apply the fundamental research principles underlying the capture and analysis of germ warfare agents to the development of a disease risk prediction system for agriculture came from UH researchers, led by McCluskey. Funded by Innovate UK \[ **G3**\], the CRBT group worked with Fera Science Ltd, Bayer Crop Science and UK SME Optisense Ltd to design SporeSentry, the first autonomous spore\-sampling system than can detect airborne fungal pathogens in cereal crops, which cost the UK £120m annually. The technology, for which UH and Optisense jointly own the IP, comprises an air suction spore trap that takes in air and captures fungal spores. These are analysed, the data is merged with weather data, and a forecast disease risk is sent to farmers and growers via an online platform. The system is designed to allow more effective timing and targeting of fungicide control, saving farmers and growers money and giving them more time to tackle the disease, thus increasing yields and profitability. It also benefits the environment and addresses the growing problem of fungicide resistance. 

 In the development phase McCluskey showcased pre\-production systems at Cereals 2017, 2018 and 2019 \(Europe’s leading technical event for the arable industry\) and at the American Phytopathology Society annual meeting in Cleveland in August 2019. He worked with the British Embassy in Colombia so they could showcase the technology at Latin America’s Expo Agrofuturo in 2018 and 2019. The system was well received by the sector. Bayer described Spore Sentry as ‘ *one of the most exciting projects*’ in disease forecasting as it can warn farmers of crop infections ‘ *up to three weeks before they can see the disease, allowing much more time to tackle the pathogen*’ \[ **5.10**\]. One agronomist told Agronomist & Arable Farmer magazine \[ **5.11**\]: ‘ *My time on farm is precious so having an idea on potential issues in advance will allow me to manage my time more effectively … this technology will allow us to schedule sprayer patterns by crop risk. Farm revenue is ultimately down to optimising crop performance, knowing which fields are under the greatest risk is bound to benefit.’* A *Farmers Weekly* article on ‘3 high\-tech gadgets for monitoring crop diseases’ highlighted Spore Sentry as ‘ *the most interesting technology*’ of the three \[ **5.11**\]. 

 In September 2020, Fera Science and Crop Health and Protection \(CHAP\) launched CropMonitor Pro, a digital decision support system that helps farmers, growers and agronomists predict the likelihood of pest and disease outbreaks for winter wheat, winter oilseed rape and potatoes at field level. It was funded by Innovate UK as part of the UK Government’s Agri\-tech strategy and is available on a subscription basis. The platform has been ‘ *designed to facilitate incorporation of as many automated solutions as possible to improve accuracy and reduce overhead costs*’ \[ **5.12**\]. This includes ‘ *a new automated spore collection and diagnosis device \(SporeSentry\) which will communicate detection of pathogen spores to the CropMonitor Pro platform to enhance model outputs*’ \[ **5.12**\]. Pre\-production prototypes of the SporeSentry are available for use by Fera Science and the CropMonitor programme. Full production of the SporeSentry was due to commence in Q1 2020 but halted due to the strategic decision by Optisense to support the national Covid response through increased production and support of Molecular Diagnostic platforms for the detection and analysis of SARS\-CoV\-2. Production resumed in 2021 with units ready for market in 2022 \[ **5.13**\].

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Researchers within EaStCHEM have translated high\-quality research in porous materials to wide\-reaching impact via creation of spin\-out companies and influencing international innovation policy. 

 Research from EaStCHEM Professor Russell Morris has demonstrated controlled release of nitric oxide \(NO\) from porous materials. This has led to the formation of two spin\-out companies, *Zeomedix LLC* and *MOFGen*, which developed new medical products that incorporate NO\-loaded porous materials. These two companies have attracted significant initial investment of GBP500,000 and generated revenues of approximately GBP200,000. The IP generated by EaStCHEM and these two companies has been optioned by manufacturing giant *PQ Silicas*. Another spin\-out company, *PanaceaNano*, has commercialised controlled time\-release of agents using biodegradable porous materials co\-developed by EaStCHEM Professor Alexandra Slawin. *PanaceaNano* began in 2015, supported by USD5,500,000 in initial investment, and has launched its first product, a line of anti\-aging skincare products under the brand *NOBLE*™. 

 Based on his expertise in the scale\-up and formulation of porous materials for use in biomedical applications, Morris was requested to chair a policy committee of the Swedish government’s innovation agency, *Vinnova*. Implementation of *Vinnova*’s policy recommendations has resulted in Swedish government investment of \[text removed for publication\] between August 2013 and 31 December 2020 into healthcare consortia that involve \[text removed for publication\], resulting in wide\-ranging economic and healthcare benefits in Sweden.

#  2. Underpinning research 

 EaStCHEM researchers \(Professors Ashbrook, McKeown, Morris, Slawin, Wright\) have a longstanding track record of innovative research in porous materials, such as zeolites, polymers and metal\-organic frameworks \(MOFs\). This includes investigating their synthesis, structure and properties, as well as employing these materials in downstream applications. 

##  The challenge: controlling the release of guest molecules from porous materials 

 Porous materials, such as zeolites and metal\-organic frameworks \(MOFs\), are prepared as microcrystalline powders and it is a major challenge to scale\-up and formulate these materials for medical or commercial use. 

##  Controlled release of biologically relevant molecules 

 The Morris research group patented **\[** [**WO2005003032A1**](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2005003032A1/en) **\]** and published research in 2006 **\[R1\]** demonstrating that porous materials \(zeolites\) could be used to adsorb, store and deliver biologically active and therapeutic gases such as nitric oxide \(NO\) in medically relevant quantities at controllable rates. The key advance was the use of toxicologically acceptable formulations of polymer/zeolite composites that provide shelf\-stable products, either as self\-supporting composites or as coatings on polymer\-based devices. Importantly, the formulation was further extended in 2008 to include a non\-aqueous ointment formulation that was demonstrated to be safely used on human skin **\[R2\]**. The types of porous materials used were expanded to metal\-organic frameworks \(MOFs\) in 2008 **\[R3\]**. Extremely high\-capacity MOF/polymer composites were then developed that can deliver not only NO but also other medically active gases \(such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide\) and/or other agents such as antibiotics **\[patent \#:**  [**WO2012020214A2**](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2012020214A2/en) **based on R4\]**. The Morris group has also developed polyurethane/MOF, silicone/MOF and PVC/MOF composites that are bioactive in their own right, without the need for any guest molecules. These composites can be fabricated on a large scale using only water as a solvent **\[R5\]**. In addition to the 36 papers linked to this body of work, the research generated a portfolio of 8 patents that are owned by the University of St Andrews. This translational research illustrates the lifecycle of invention from the genesis of the material and structural elucidation within the chemistry laboratory, through scale\-up, to formulation in industry. 

 Toxicologically benign and biodegradable MOFs based on cyclodextrins \(CDs\), naturally occurring and biodegradable oligosaccharides, are another class of materials that permit the controlled release of guest compounds. These were co\-developed by Slawin, who successfully elucidated the highly complex structure of these MOFs using single crystal X\-ray diffraction, despite the challenges posed by both data collection and analysis, which had previously thwarted attempts by other crystallographers **\[R6\]**. The use of cyclodextrin components endows these MOFs with enhanced aqueous solubility, low toxicity and a high concentration of binding sites for the encapsulation of organic compounds such as drug molecules. This work has been patented, with Slawin as a co\-inventor **\[patent \#:**  [**US20150322174A1**](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20150322174A1/en) **\]**.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact underpinned by the research takes on two distinct forms. 

1.  The commercialisation of porous materials for medical and cosmetic applications through spin\-out companies, *MOFGen*, *Zeomedix* and *PanaceaNano*, each of which received significant investment funding to help bring products to market. 

1.  Morris was invited to participate \(from 2014\) and then chair \(from 2016\) committees for *Vinnova*, an agency that advises the Swedish government on innovation policy. The Swedish government’s adoption of these policy recommendations has led directly to investments in consortia focussing on healthcare delivery with a total value of EUR15,400,000 since August 2013 \(calculated in November 2019 by *Vinnova*\). 

 

 **Figure 1**. Timeline showing the development of impact from the primary underpinning research described in Section 2 \(blue line and blue circles refer to publications referenced in Section 3\).* 

The research to impact timeline is described in Figure 1. 

##  i\) Economic and commercial impact from spin\-out companies 

 Since 2014, concerted activity to translate the underpinning research on porous materials into the development and commercialisation of medical products has occurred as follows. 

1.  The commercial activity of two start\-up companies, *Zeomedix LLC* and *MOFGen Ltd*., which have exploited the EaStCHEM zeolite and MOF technology, respectively, for wound healing formulations and medical device coatings **\[S1\-S2\]**. *MOFGen* **won the RSC’s Emerging Technologies Prize in 2016.** 

1.  The investment provided by *PQ Silicas*, a global materials manufacturer, into *Zeomedix* and their joint development projects for the production of ointments for wound healing \(Figure 2a\) **\[S1\]**. *PQ Silicas* has taken an option on the IP from *MOFGen* \(12\-2019\) for GBP80,000. 

1.  The investment of over GBP300,000 provided by Mercia Fund Management and the Scottish Investment Bank into *MOFGen Ltd* was supplemented by a GBP200,000 investment of public funding into the start\-up \(10\-2016\) **\[S2\]**. 

1.  The following companies have partnered with *MOFGen Ltd* through joint development \(JD\) projects across the healthcare sector to develop technology/products, generating revenue for the partner companies **\[S2\]**: 

  1.  *Fine Industries Ltd* \(UK\) for the water\-based scale\-up of MOFs \(Figure 2a\) **\[R5\]**. Fine Industries are a Good Manufacturing Practice\-accredited manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients. This JD \(2014\-2016\) provided the necessary capability for GMP manufacture of the MOFs for medical applications and included revenue to *Fine Industries Ltd* of GBP40,000. 

  1.  *Scott and Fyfe Ltd* \(UK\) for the large\-scale formulation of MOF\-coated non\-woven fabrics. This JD \(2015\) demonstrated a roll\-to\-roll technology for the production of 100 metres of MOF\-coated wound\-healing gauze fabric \(Figure 2b\) and was funded by *MOFGen Ltd* and *Scott & Fyfe Ltd* jointly. 

  1.  T*eleflex Inc* \(USA\), one of the world’s largest medical device manufacturers, for the coated introducer sheaths used in cardiovascular interventions. This JD resulted in the manufacture of MOF/polyurethane coated devices including for cardiac catheterisation. Between 2016 and 2019, this provided sales of MOF/polyurethane coating formulations of more than USD110,000 for *MOFGen Ltd*. Figure 2c shows one of the coated introducer sheaths prepared by *Teleflex Ltd*. 

  1.  *5D Ltd* \(UK\) for the development of antibacterial assays specifically designed to establish that the MOF/polymer formulations do not leach toxic metals in significant amounts provided revenue to *5D Ltd* of GBP50,000 between 2017 and 2019.

The company’s first commercialised products are cosmetics, including anti\-aging eye cream, anti\-wrinkle night cream and skin rejuvenation serum **\[S5\]**. The launch was accomplished using a multimillion\-dollar multi\-media advertising campaign \(Figure 3\), with the product being sold internationally. 

##  ii\) Public policy impact for innovation in Sweden 

 Recognizing his contributions to research on porous materials and their translation to medical products, the Swedish Government Innovation agency *Vinnova* in 2014 invited Morris to join/lead a team of five international researchers **\[S6\]**. This committee would develop policy recommendations for the investment activities of *Vinnova* to enhance the industrial innovation landscape in Sweden **\[S7, p7\-8\]**. Based on the resulting recommendations, *Vinnova* chose the scale\-up and formulation for the manufacturing of advanced medical products, as specifically recommended by Morris, to be the focus for the first so\-called *Vinnova Competence Centres* launched in early 2016. 

 To highlight the direct link from Morris’ research to *Vinnova* policy and to its subsequent impact, the *Vinnova* Director of Centres wrote **\[S5\]**: 

 *“Russell Morris’ published research into the scale up and formulation of materials for medical applications \(especially his work on medical gas delivery for humans\) was therefore key in Vinnova choosing him to lead both the policy recommendations and an evaluation of the impact of this policy on the Swedish innovation landscape.”* 

 Morris currently chairs the committee of three international experts that evaluates the impact of the centres; the first impact evaluations were completed in 11\-2019. On the basis of these evaluations, investment of: \( **1**\) \[text removed for publication\]between August 2013 and 31 December 2020; \( **2**\) SEK14,400,000/EUR1,350,000 from all seven of Sweden’s healthcare regions; \( **3**\) SEK86,400,000 \(EUR8,100,000\) from the Swedish Government, to the centres has been secured. 

 The impact of the policy and the subsequent combined investment from companies, the Swedish Healthcare regions and the national government, has led to the evolution of an ecosystem devoted to the development and commercialisation of advanced medical products in Sweden. The impact is wide\-ranging, from the development of manufacturing processes and specific new products to Sweden\-wide collaborations for the elaboration of novel routes to therapeutics. Specific impacts from the development work are, as the *Vinnova* Director of Centres describes **\[S6, p3\]**, as follows: 

 *“The impact \[of the policy\] to date has been wide\-ranging and is developing very quickly. As well as the initiation of major projects based on the industry investment, cross cutting themes have developed scale\-up and formulation, Standard Operating Practices that have been shared with all industrial and public partners – giving outstanding benefits in terms of know how.  However, there are more tangible impacts. Most notable is the library of scaled up human protein therapeutics, completed in the CellNova Center, that is now worth an estimated \[text removed for publication\]. This library is being exploited by the industrial partners.”*

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 NHS England’s £83bn estate must deliver radically new services and care for increasing numbers of patients with dementia, but there is a growing £7bn maintenance backlog which threatens users’ safety and service continuity. Strategic Asset Management research at Loughborough University demonstrated how to better design, fund, and manage NHS England’s estate. By working closely with Department of Health and Social Care and the NHS, research has: 1\) transformed the way NHS England spends its annual £3.7bn capital and its £9.5bn estate management budget; 2\) improved the quality of life and care for 100,000 people living with dementia, including staff and carers, and 3\) following substantial evaluation across a £50 million capital investment programme, been translated into formal national design guidance for dementia\-friendly health and social care environments. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Healthcare infrastructure spans the complete range of NHS medical provision, from specialist and local hospitals, to community health services and GP\-led care centres. Research starting in 2006 by Price, Mahadkar and Mills explored the role of stakeholder consultation within healthcare infrastructure planning and design process, where stakeholders range from patients and their families/carers, to those delivering clinical services **\[R1\]**. This research identified a need for improved sustainable \(long\-term\) Strategic Asset Management \(SAM\) within the NHS and embedding patient\-centric solutions in infrastructure changes/improvements. Subsequent research **\[R5\]** by Price, Mourshed, Pascale and Pantzartzis examined how the NHS estate should evolve to specifically accommodate the needs of patients with dementia and their carers. 

 The team’s research revealed that contemporary SAM approaches were short\-term and entailed poor stakeholder consultation, meaning NHS investments were not delivering patient\-centric solutions.  For example, of the 149 Primary Care Trusts’ \(PCTs\) consultations analysed, only 1% included travel/transport related questions, which are essential to determining service accessibility. The analysis was underpinned by a web\-based document review of consultation practices within 149 English PCTs, and participation in a consultation case study with Leicestershire County and Rutland PCT where we designed and performed a detailed content analysis of 876 questionnaire responses and 78 letters to assess regional strategic estate plans and explore the inter\-relationships between the planning and consultation processes. 

 The research identified gaps within English PCTs’ stakeholder consultation practices and a lack of core SAM competencies within the NHS. The work enabled the development of a novel, systematic, coordinated, evidence\- and capability\-based approach to SAM, which encompassed the three key areas of estates, care services and transport. These were integrated with consultation as a fundamental part of the healthcare infrastructure planning process to realise improved investment decision making by NHS Trusts. The research findings of this study were designed to be directly used by healthcare policy makers to put patients at the heart of SAM **\[R1\]**. Our SAM research went on to highlight the issue of maintenance backlog and examined in detail ‘critical backlog’ which puts patients and service continuity at risk. The research revealed the causes and significant scale of the problem, and that the total backlog had grown to £6.5bn, over half of which was critical, with most residing in a relatively small number of Acute Trusts.  Our cost modelling demonstrated that: i\) Trusts need to invest ≈1% of income simply to maintain backlog levels; and ii\) there is a need for a long\-term SAM to estate funding, delivery, and management **\[R2\]**. 

 Building on our patient\-centric SAM research, we analysed data from the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) England’s National Dementia Capital Investment Programme and its 115 pilot projects. The research advocates strategies for making care environments more dementia\-friendly thereby improving the Quality of Life \(QoL\) for people living with dementia whilst reducing the associated cost of care provision. The research also identified the healthcare spaces and building elements with the greatest impact on QoL and healthcare costs **\[R3\]**. Further research revealed that design standards and guidance, including those for nursing homes, did not take a patient \(or care home resident\) centric approach and failed to accommodate the proven association of therapeutic lighting with well\-being of the elderly. More generally, the need for robust evidence\-based design guidance in relation to dementia was identified **\[R4\]**. Building on this work, our research explored the built environment elements that make a difference to the quality of dementia care and care outcomes. Working in close collaboration with the DHSC, dementia experts and Pilot Project Stakeholders \(including end users\), we developed ten design principles and provided case study exemplars of how these could be used to improve safety and dignity whilst reducing confusion, isolation, and anxiety, and help people live well with their dementia **\[R5\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since 2014, Loughborough University researchers have collaborated closely with DHSC policy makers, NHS Improvement, NHS estate managers, clinicians, nurses, architects, engineers, patients, residents, and providers. The LU team and our expertise have been embedded within NHS regional strategic consultation exercises and hospital design processes. We contributed to policy development through commissioned research and membership of the following strategic and influential groups: DHSC Estates and Facilities Productivity Think Tank; DHSC Dementia Friendly Environment Working Group; DHSC Estates and Facilities Division Advisory Group; and the BIM4Health Task Group **\[S1, S2\]**. These led to impact in three areas: 

 **Impact 1:  Transformed the NHS’s capital funding and estate management practices** 

 Our research into the SAM of healthcare estates changed the way NHS England spends its annual £3.7bn capital and £9.5bn estate management budgets, and in so doing improved the safety, efficiency and efficacy of healthcare services. 

 With over 1,500 sites, the NHS’s £83bn estate is one of Europe’s largest. It must meet safety and statutory standards, deliver increasingly complex clinical activities, and support enhanced efficiency and productivity. This is challenged by a legacy of old, unfit for purpose buildings, many approaching the end of their useful life: 18% pre\-date the NHS \(<1948\) and 43% are more than 30 years old. 

 Following twelve research projects, and frequent direct engagement with DHSC, NHS Trusts, healthcare planners and practitioners, LU was commissioned by NHS Improvement to develop a new SAM plan. This research involved a national survey in conjunction with NHS Improvement of the 217 NHS Trusts \(which employ around 800,000 of the NHS's 1.2 million staff\); international and cross\-sector comparisons; interviews; validation workshop, and analysis of Trusts’ annual returns which reported increasing safety failures and shutdowns, with maintenance backlogs growing to £6.5bn, causing significant risk to patients and service continuity. This led to LU’s <ins>nine evidence\-based recommendations</ins> which, following their implementation, produced a step\-change in how NHS assets are funded and managed. 

 The DHSC <ins>adopted our recommendations</ins> within its Health Infrastructure Plan \(HIP, ‘ *the biggest hospital building programme in a generation*’\) including the development of a new, strategic approach to improving healthcare infrastructure. Consequently, NHS capital funding allocations changed from a one\-year to a five\-year rolling allocation within a 10\-year plan, with an effective replenishment, replacement, and disposal strategy for the NHS estate. Furthermore, the capital funding is now linked to short, medium, and long\-term incentives and actions which has changed the way that the life cycles of NHS infrastructure and assets are governed, planned, financed, procured, designed, built, managed, and decommissioned **\[S1, S2\]**. 

 Our ranking of maintenance backlogs within 223 NHS Trusts provided evidence to NHS Improvement in their discussions with Treasury as to where this funding should target and resulted in substantial new, long\-term, investment in the future of the NHS estate, beginning with “ *£600 million to reduce backlog maintenance and improve the NHS Estate; and 40 hospitals to be built by 2030 as part of a package worth £3.7 billion”* **\[S1\]**. 

 *“The research evidence and recommendations informed and strengthened the NHS Innovation’s business case development for NHS Estate Funding and discussions with Treasury …. Without this evidence it is unlikely that the recently announced funding would have been secured.”* **\[S1\]** 

 The NHS now plans and manages its estate in accordance with LU’s recommendations for a long\-term approach and improved data quality, with a backlog data collection processes that is now embedded within the NHS Model Hospital and NHS Premises Assurance Model \(PAM\), with sustainability and estate digitalisation being central to the HIP **\[S1, S2\]**. 

 **Impact 2: Improved the quality of life and care for people living with dementia** 

 LU research on how the built environment informed the selection, design, and operation of the DHSC England’s National Dementia £50 million Capital Investment Programme’s 115 England\-wide pilot projects, the delivery and impact of which LU were employed to monitor and assess. This was achieved through our extensive knowledge exchange process and strong pathways created with project stakeholders \(e.g., design teams and end\-users\), including a website, workshops, webinars, presentations from experts and 25 detailed case studies, report templates, and impact assessment methodology **\[S3\].** 

 Incorporation of our research findings within the design process by pilot projects delivered innovative dementia\-friendly care environments, including the use of supportive technologies and dementia\-friendly design details, which provided cost\-effective benefits to ≈ 100,000 patients, staff and carers \[ **S3**\]. Self\-evaluation of the changes by the project teams and analysis by LU researchers determined that in acute, social and community settings, sustained improvements in the three areas described below have been achieved over the past four years, and will remain for the foreseeable future \[ **S4**\]: 

-  People living with dementia benefited from reduced stigmatisation and institutionalisation, increased privacy and dignity, improved quality of life of \(e.g., sleeping patterns, eating habits, daily activities, medication, interaction with relatives and staff\) and reduced slips, trips, falls and challenging behaviour **\[S4, S5, S6, S7\]**. 

-  Staff experienced calmer and safer environments and improved their understanding of the impact of the environment especially when managing complex needs **\[S4, S5, S6, S7\]**. 

-  Care providers benefited from reduced costs associated with decreased staff sickness rates and turnover, and reduced interventions, e.g., medication **\[S4, S5, S6, S7\]**. 

 There was significant roll\-out of our research and pilot project experience into projects outside the DHSC Dementia Capital Programme, including in University Hospital Leicester \(UHL\) and Cambridge University Hospital \(CUH\) as testified by Rachel Northfield \- Estates and Facilities, Head of Quality and Safety Governance, CUH: 

 *“Principles from the project have been translated into other schemes wherever possible. It acknowledged that environments for those with dementia also support those with other disabilities or other needs”* **\[S10\]**. 

 The research has, according to the NHS, enabled them to “ *achieve significant improvements in the quality of life of those living with dementia”* **\[S1\]**. 

 **Impact 3: Produced new national guidance for designing dementia\-friendly built environments** 

 LU’s multiple award winning **\[S8\]** research and real time evaluation **\[S3\]** of how the built environment can provide dementia\-friendly conditions in the UK’s hospitals and 32,000\+ care homes has fundamentally changed the way the NHS specifies its new and upgraded facilities and how design consultants deliver them. 

 Our analysis of the DHSC England’s National Dementia Capital Investment Programme and its 115 pilot projects \(costing £50 million\) which led to improved QoL and care directly led to and shaped the development of *Health Building Note HBN08\-02, Dementia\-friendly Health and Social Care Environments*. **\[S9\]** This is the first HBN covering both health and social care and provides national guidance enabling architects, designers, and care providers to ensure all new or refurbished facilities are dementia friendly. The LU team are named as the only authors of the HBN. The Chief Executive of Care England, Prof Martin Green OBE said, in the Foreword: 

 “*I am extremely delighted with this new guidance document, which has been put together by some of the leading figures in the health and social case sector… This expertise is now available to all those who are running or developing dementia services … \[as\] the foundation for all development and refurbishment decisions*” **\[S9\]**. 

 This <ins>guidance has been adopted in England, Scotland</ins><ins>,</ins> <ins>and Wales. It is mandatory for the design of all new and refurbished NHS buildings</ins>, including HIP. It has also been embedded within national annual governance, evaluation, and assurance processes \(e.g., NHS PAM and Patient\-Led Assessments of the Care Environment: ‘PLACE’\). This motivated care providers to improve their environments in ways which benefits the 850,000 \(projected to increase to 1.6 million by 2040\) people living with dementia in the UK **\[S1, S9\].** There were clear and measurable improvements in the assessment scores of how the environment supported the provision of clinical care, assessing privacy and dignity, food, cleanliness, general building maintenance and the extent to which the environment supported the care of those with dementia **\[S9**\]. This quantifies and showcases the positive change made through the application of our research, now translated into published national design guidance, HBN08\-02. 

 Finally, Price and Pantzartzis worked closely with the design team for the recently built new Emergency Floor, University Hospitals of Leicester \(UHL\). Dr Pillai, Head of Service, Emergency Department, used HBN08\-02 as the basis for ensuring a frailty and dementia friendly design was achieved: 

 “*UHL staff used the guidance contained within HBN 08\-02 which led to better insight into design principles \(floor, colour scheme, internal layout, visual impact etc\)* … *Staff are unanimous in how it has improved the working condition for them and allowed them to provide better care to the patients*”. 

 The outcome, and calmer environment, has improved patient care and experience. It has benefitted working environments leading to better staff morale, recruitment, and retention **\[S10\]**.

#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Brighton and Sussex Medical School \(BSMS\) research into hypertension has, for the first time, provided blood pressure targets for the very elderly \(> 80 years\) to reduce the risk of death due to stroke or heart attack. Prior to this, there was no defined targets for blood pressure in this age group. The effective target of 150/80 mmHg, identified in the research, underpin recommendations in NICE guidance \(UK\) on cardiovascular diseases and blood pressure management, as well as international healthcare guidelines in Europe, USA, Canada and China. This has resulted in improved clinical practice in England with 86.5% of patients with arterial disease now meeting the revised target blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg, leading to improved health outcomes. 
","
#  2. Underpinning research 

 An estimated 1,130,000,000 people worldwide have hypertension with the condition affecting approximately one third of adults in the UK; however, this figure rises to more than two in three for those over the age of seventy\-five. Hypertension causes brain clots and blocked arteries, which can result in strokes or heart attacks. Although a number of clinical trials have shown the benefit of hypertensive drug treatment on stroke, cardiovascular events and mortality, very few studies include the very elderly \(corresponding to WHO ‘oldest\-old’ as people aged 80 years and over\) or have recruited too few to show an advantage of treatment. This has not only generated concerns that treatment for this demographic may be harmful, but it also raises ethical questions over whether this population is being denied the opportunity to benefit from clinical treatment. 

 In 2000, the HYVET Trial was conceived to provide the research evidence required and to resolve persistent areas of clinical uncertainty about the relative benefits and risks of antihypertensive treatment in this neglected patient group. The trial built on early collaborative research findings from trials of hypertension treatment to which Professor Chakravarthi Rajkumar was a co\-investigator. The HYVET Trial \(2000 – 2008\) was funded by the British Heart Foundation and the pharmaceutical company, the Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier. It was led by Professor Bulpitt \(Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College\) and Professor Fletcher \(London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\) with Rajkumar contributing expertise through the role of national coordinator for the UK, and analysis of the results for the full duration of the project \[reference 3.1\]. Rajkumar was a Senior Registrar and Senior Lecturer at the Hammersmith Hospital before joining the University of Sussex in 2005 where he led the project to its completion in 2008. 

 The HYVET trial enrolled 3,845 patients aged 80 years and over, at 195 centres in 13 countries across Western and Eastern Europe, as well as in China, Australasia and North Africa. The participants enrolled had a sustained systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg at entry into the trial. The therapeutic intervention was 1.5mg of the diuretic drug *indapamide* against matching placebo. The angiotensin\-converting enzyme \(ACE\) inhibitor *perindopril* was added in a dose of 2 or 4 mg if necessary, in order to achieve a target blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg \[3.1\]. 

 Increasing age is a major predictor of death from stroke, with rates as high as 52% in persons 80 years of age or older. After 2 years of treatment the mean blood pressure reduced by 15/6.1 mmHg in the active treatment cohort. This group also showed a 30% reduction in the rate of fatal or non\-fatal stroke, a 39% reduction in the rate of death from stroke, a 21% reduction in the rate of death from any cause, a 23% reduction in the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, and a 64% reduction in the rate of heart failure. The trial also showed that there were significantly fewer serious adverse events in the active treatment group, with the baseline characteristics of the two patient groups well matched in terms of previous cardiovascular events and diabetes \[3.1\]. 

 A parallel study into ambulatory blood pressure \(ABP\) monitoring was led by Rajkumar as part of the main trial \[3.2\]. ABP was measured in 284 participants recruited to the HYVET trial. This analysis showed that 50% of the main trial participants satisfied the criteria for White Coat Hypertension based on daytime ABP monitoring. White Coat Hypertension is a phenomenon in which patients exhibit a higher blood pressure level in a clinical setting than in other contexts such as their home. The findings of this parallel study, paired with the results of the main trial, suggest that treating White Coat Hypertension in the over 80s might confer some protection to future cardiovascular events. In the same ABP monitoring sub\-study, Rajkumar and colleagues also showed that reduced arterial stiffness at night might partly explain the marked benefits observed in the main trial \[3.3\]. 

 The HYVET trial, and parallel studies, provided the first conclusive evidence that blood pressure\-lowering drug treatments significantly benefit people aged 80 years or older. It also provided an indication of the blood pressure threshold to target for effective management of hypertension in the very elderly.

#  4. Details of the impact 

 The HYVET Trial provided the research\-based evidence needed to establish a blood pressure target within national and international healthcare guidelines. This measure is specifically for the treatment of hypertension in the over 80s. Prior to this study, this patient group had been neglected with no appropriate measure available to guide clinical practice in relation to these patients. As a result General Practitioners in England now have a set blood pressure threshold to refer to when considering hypertensive treatment in this age group. 

##  4.1 Providing clinical guidance on hypertension in the UK \(NICE\) and internationally \(USA, Canada, Europe and China\) 

 Research within the HYVET programme provided guidance to physicians and policy\-makers to improve standards, assist in the knowledge and training of health care professionals and to help patients make informed decisions about their care. These national guidelines undergo regular reviews to ensure that recommendations provided are based on the most recent and robust research findings. 

 In the UK, the findings of the HYVET trial were incorporated originally into NICE guidelines as recommendations for the treatment of hypertension in 2011. Following a review of these guidelines in 2019, it was confirmed that these findings remain the critical reference point for guideline committees to base their recommendation for the treatment of hypertension in the very elderly \[source 5.1\]. Professor Terry McCormack, member of the NICE 2011 Guideline Development Group and the NICE 2019 Guideline Committee on Hypertension confirmed that this study was ‘ *pivotal in setting the standard for the treatment of hypertension in the very elderly*’. Professor McCormack further clarifies that: 

 *‘In both instances when considering the optimum blood pressure in the very elderly, the HYVET study provided the most robust and highest quality evidence compared to all the other studies reviewed. Based on the trial results, the 2011 Guideline Development Group recommended that people aged 80 years old and over \[…\] should be treated to a clinic blood pressure target of under 150/90mmHg, as defined by the HYVET Trial. This recommendation was sustained in the updated version of the guideline published in August 2019 \[…\] Based on their experience the \[NICE 2019\] committee members agreed to retain the recommendation from the 2011 guideline, which was based on the HYVET Trial \- the only large, outcome\-based randomised controlled trial in this age group*’ \[5.2, 5.3\]. 

 HYVET is the key evidence cited in international guidelines to treat high blood pressure in people aged 80 years and over \[5.4\], and by providing this guidance to healthcare professionals worldwide, the HYVET study has contributed to ‘ *an improved quality of care*’ \[5.2\]. The international guidelines that utilise the HYVET results to evidence their recommendations include the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines, the Hypertension Canada Guidelines, the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines, and the Chinese guideline for the management of hypertension in the elderly. Each set of guidelines adopts a rigorous, evidence\-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals and medications in the management of hypertension in adults and grade the quality of evidence. Recommendations are made based on their effect on prioritised outcomes. Adopting this stringent evidence\-driven process, the authors of these guidelines, drawn from a significant pool of international experts in the field, cited the HYVET Trial as one of the critical studies for clinical effectiveness of the treatment of hypertension in the very elderly. 

 One of the most influential guideline updates is the eighth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure \(JNC8\) published by the American Medical Association in 2014 that replaces the previous guidelines published in 2003. Panel members appointed to this review developed evidence statements and recommendations for blood pressure treatment based on a systematic review of the literature to meet user needs and the needs of the primary care clinician. Randomised controlled trials, including the HYVET study, formed the basis of these new guidelines, as they represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. In this guideline the recommendation to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower BP to 150/90 to treat patients over the age of 60 \(including the very elderly\) was given a Grade A recommendation, the strongest grade given to recommendations where ‘ *there is high certainty based on evidence that the net benefit is substantial*’ \[5.5\]. 

##  4.2 Changing clinical practice and the treatment of hypertension in the very elderly in England 

 Due to the introduction of a new blood pressure target for the very elderly, based on the HYVET findings, monitoring of clinical practice data is now available. In March 2015 a review of the adoption and implementation of NICE Guidance CG127 \(2011\), showed that 85.6% of patients in England with peripheral arterial disease had their last blood pressure reading \(measured in the preceding 12 months\) set at 150/90mmHg or less \[5.6\]. This is directly in line with NICE Guidance for Recommendation 1.5.6 based on the HYVET Trial. NICE generate Quality Standard \(QS\) for GPs and other care providers to use to evaluate their current practice and understand how to improve care. The uptake of the NICE QS is measured via various national records such as the Quality Outcome Framework \(QOF\). QOF is a voluntary annual reward and incentive programme for all GP practices in England. It consists of a set of achievement measures, based on the NICE indicators, against which GP practices are scored and rewarded financially. The QS28 'Hypertension in Adults' Statement 4 is based on the HYVET Trial findings that recommends ' *people with treated hypertension have a clinic blood pressure target set to below 140/90 mmHg if aged under 80 years, or below 150/90 mmHg if aged 80 years and over*.' As part of its uptake assessment, QOF recorded the percentage of patients with hypertension in whom the last blood pressure reading \(measured in the preceding 12 months\) was 150/90 mmHg or less. Data collected from GP practices across England, in March 2016, March 2017 and March 2019 showed that 79.6%, 80% and 79.7% of patients reached this blood pressure target, respectively \[5.7\]. These data confirm that the blood pressure targets in the very elderly, informed by the HYVET trial, have been met in up to 80% of patients treated for hypertension at GP practices in England.

 1. Summary of the impact 

 Phytate in animal feed impairs the growth and sustainable production of poultry. Consequently, phytases \- enzymes that degrade phytate \- are added to 95% of commercial poultry feeds across the globe. **Brearley**’s research on how phytases affect phytates has impacted the animal feed industry on a global scale. This has been achieved by direct intervention and via knowledge transfer to AB Vista, a UK animal nutrition technology company. **Brearley**’s research has changed AB Vista’s R&D strategy, know\-how, marketing behaviour and technology adoption, enabling AB Vista to become one of the three largest animal feed enzyme suppliers in the world. Overall, this impact and its knock\-on effects have benefited an industry sector producing more than 10 billion chickens per year \- approximately 17% of global production – in a multibillion\-dollar enzyme market. 
","
 2. Underpinning research 

 
Phytate, a component of animal feed, is a potent anti\-nutrient that is estimated to cost the global poultry industry USD2,000,000,000 \(05\-2014\) per year in lost growth performance. Feed supplements that contain phytases aid digestive degradation of phytate, improve mineral, protein and amino acid digestibility, and release phosphate, which is essential for bone development. They therefore strongly improve animal growth. 

 Since the first commercial phytase was released to market in the late 1990s, phytases have become essential components of commercial poultry and pig feeds. However, until 2014, the benefits of phytase to poultry growth performance were thought to lie predominantly with degradation of phytate, also known as inositol hexakisphosphate, to lower inositol phosphates. This interpretation came from animal feed trials in which growth performance was enhanced by phytase. But, at that point, few studies had considered the detailed mechanism of phytate degradation or its interaction with animal performance. 

 <ins> *Elucidating</ins> <ins>the</ins> <ins>mechanism</ins> <ins>of</ins> <ins>phytase</ins> <ins></ins><ins>\(Quantum Blue\)</ins> <ins>action</ins> <ins></ins><ins>in partnership with AB Vista*</ins>: In 2012, AB Vista's Research Director and team approached **Brearley** to contract him to conduct consultancy/contract research with the purpose of providing scientific guidance and a mechanistic explanation for the company's dosing strategy when including phytase in poultry feeds. They also invited him to give a Plenary Talk at the AB Vista\-sponsored 2<sup>nd</sup> Phytase Summit. AB Vista sought to access **Brearley’s** recognised expertise in inositol phosphate and phytase research \[R1, R2\] because AB Vista lacked the expertise to undertake analysis of inositol phosphates themselves. The specific questions for which answers were sought were: in what part of the digestive tract does phytate digestion occur, how is this affected by phytase dose, and how does growth performance of monogastric animals \(poultry and pig\) correlate with individual inositol phosphates produced in different parts of the gut? AB Vista's approach was timely because the company had just launched its new phytase product Quantum Blue, and **Brearley** had developed 2d\-HPLC \(High Performance Liquid Chromatography\) pulsed amperometry methods suitable for measurement of inositol, the ultimate product of degradation of phytate \(research later published as \[R3\]\). At the time, the industry had noticed that incremental increases in animal performance could be obtained by increasing doses of phytase. These increases surpassed those attainable by supplementation of diet with phosphate. These so\-called ""extra\-phosphoric"" effects became known as ""Superdosing"", a term coined by AB Vista \(Walk CL et al. 2013. *Poultry Science* 92: 719\-725. DOI: 10.3382/ps.2012\-02727\), even if the explanation for how exactly they worked eluded the industry. 

 <ins> *The role of inositol*</ins>: Since 2013, **Brearley** has worked with AB Vista on its Quantum Blue product to determine the optimal dosing regimen of phytase for animal production. **Brearley** recognised and reported to AB Vista that the real value of Superdosing was likely to stem from the release of inositol, historically considered a vitamin. He confirmed this, providing AB Vista with analytical data that were published by the company as their first report of the effect of Superdosing with phytase \(Quantum Blue\) on measured inositol release and its correlation with growth performance in poultry \[S2\]. **Brearley** also led the development of robust, sensitive methods of measurement of inositol phosphates \(isomers\) and inositol. These have been applied to feed trials of standard and Superdoses of phytase, using samples of feed and gut contents from different parts of the gastrointestinal tract. The work has been funded directly by AB Vista \[Grant A\] and by a joint BBSRC grant with AB Vista \[Grant B\]. 

 <ins> *Global</ins> <ins>developments of the Brearley/AB Vista partnership*</ins>: The shift in attention from inositol phosphates and phosphate release to inositol as an explanation of Superdosing efficacy has been transformative for AB Vista. For example, because **Brearley** further refined his methods, making them suitable for measurement of inositol in plasma \[R3\] and animal tissue \[R4, R5\], AB Vista commissioned additional feed trials conducted by other contractors on four continents. These trials collected plasma and tissue samples from poultry and pigs \(beside feed and digesta\) for inositol analysis by **Brearley** under contract to AB Vista \[R3, R5; S1\]. 

 **Brearley** also partnered the wider AB Vista group \(AB Enzymes, Germany, and Roal Oy, Finland\) with BBSRC in pursuit of next\-generation phytases \[Grant C\]. This project arose directly from **Brearley**’s earlier discovery of a new class of phytase \[R2\] and led to a PhD studentship funded by AB Vista, one of six PhD studentships supervised by **Brearley** with funding solely from AB Vista or from AB Vista jointly with BBSRC or NERC \[S1\]. Overall, **Brearley’s** research is reported in more than twenty research outputs with AB Vista authors or co\-authors \(including \[R4\-R6\]; see also \[S1\-S3\]\). This body of work has further provided valuable information to AB Vista and the wider poultry industry on the relationship of inositol to the causes of two muscle diseases of chicken, ""Woody Breast"" and ""White Striping"" \[R5\]. These pathologies are responsible for losses of more than USD200,000,000 \(10\-2017\) per year to the poultry industry in the USA. The role of phytase and inositol release in the amelioration of these pathologies are, as a result of **Brearley**’s research, subjects of intense current interest within AB Vista \[S1\] and other feed companies.

 4. Details of the impact 

 **Brearley**'s research has had impacts on commerce, the economy and production, both directly and via knowledge transfer. The beneficiaries are commercial animal feed businesses on a global scale, specifically AB Vista and its partner companies, AB Enzymes, Germany, and Roal Oy, Finland, who produce the Quantum Blue enzyme. His research has also benefited other enzyme companies and the global poultry industry \(both producers and nutritionists\). As illustration, because of **Brearley**’s work with AB Vista, the term ""Superdosing"" has come to convey the benefits arising from provision of inositol through adding phytase to animal feed. As such, it has been accepted as a standard term in academia and industry, with more than 570 citations in Google Scholar since 2013. 

 <ins> *Change in industry R&D</ins> <ins>strategy*</ins>: **Brearley’s** research \[R3\-R6\] and his collaboration with AB Vista \[S1\] have driven a key change in AB Vista's R&D strategy. This has involved the company shifting its R&D focus towards understanding the role of inositol \[S1\-S3\], as evidenced by: AB Vista’s funding of **Brearley’s** consultancy contract \[Grant A\]; the company’s collaboration with **Brearley** in obtaining BBSRC LINK and Industrial Partnership Award funding \[Grants B, C\]; and the company’s funding of multiple PhD studentships both at UEA and internationally \[S1\]. In addition, AB Vista has commissioned research feed trials in 15 countries across four continents \(e.g. Australia, India, USA, Germany, UK\), from which it has sent samples to **Brearley** at UEA for analysis of inositol phosphate and inositol products of phytate degradation \[R3\-R5; S1\-S2\]. Overall, the involvement of **Brearley** has been a disruptive innovation for the industry's R&D. As AB Vista's Research Director stated, *“By providing us with a first set of measurements of inositol in a digestive setting, something we had not considered ourselves, Charles opened up a new research area across the animal feed industry.* *This has been very significant for AB Vista and the industry as a whole”* \[S1\]. 

 <ins> *Change in industry</ins> <ins>know\-how*</ins>: The metadata arising from analysis by **Brearley** of more than 10,000 samples from the AB Vista\-commissioned feed trials have, by providing essential scientific underpinning, reshaped AB Vista's understanding of the Quantum Blue phytase and the benefits to be gained by Superdosing. To quote AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\], *“Charles’ work on inositol and Superdosing has allowed us to progress from an understanding of the correlation of animal growth performance to inositol phosphate release, in different parts of the gut, to a sophisticated understanding of the extent of animal growth performance attributable to inositol”* \[S1\]. 

 <ins> *Change in industry behaviour: marketing*</ins>: AB Vista’s guidance on dosing of Quantum Blue has also been changed. The guidance to customers covers the range of poultry\-raising regimes used worldwide for all the chickens \(over 10,000,000,000 birds\) fed AB Vista’s phytase products. *“Our advertising strategy includes evidence generated by UEA showing that our products function at the intestinal level better than all other phytases, and the data generated enables us to explain why superdosing, for example, works in poultry and swine from a mechanistic viewpoint”* \(AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\]\). **Brearley**’s data are also reported across AB Vista’s web pages \[S3\]. 

 <ins> *Change in industry behaviour: technology adoption and knowledge transfer*</ins>: **Brearley**’s interaction with AB Vista has led to the company adopting his analytical methods. To quote AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\] *“His analytical expertise with inositol phosphates and inositol has provided a route to analysis that was not available to us before on a scale relevant to our needs. In order to be able to respond rapidly to industry needs, we are now investing heavily in Charles’ methodologies in our analytical services division in the UK”*.  Separately, **Brearley** has provided training in analytical methods to AB Enzymes \(a market leader as reflected in their turnover exceeding USD112,000,000 \(08/2019\)\), partner on Grants A\-C. This allowed for new methods to be adopted by the R&D department of AB Enzymes and in turn led to AB Enzymes testing novel applications of Quantum Blue \[S4\]. In addition, **Brearley** has transferred data on novel phytases for further investigation to Roal Oy, partner via AB Vista on Grant C. 

 <ins> *Company success*</ins>: The changes in R&D, know\-how and marketing, all arising from the new understanding of AB Vista’s Quantum Blue phytase provided by **Brearley**'s research, have enabled AB Vista to sell more of its product.  This has been achieved by advertisement of the efficiency of Quantum Blue in degrading phytate and releasing inositol \[S3\]: *“The credibility that UEA research brings to our products means that customers who are at the forefront of technology are far more likely to buy from us, …Charles’ analysis of inositol phosphates and inositol, his further development of methods suitable for tissues and organs and his interaction with our other academic partners contributes to our literature, presentations and conferences, informing existing customers regarding their use of our products, and keeping them abreast of technological developments”* \(AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\]\). **Brearley’s** research has therefore been central to AB Vista’s growth to become a top three supplier of phytase \[S1, S5\], in a market projected to exceed USD2,000,000,000 \(11\-2019\) by 2024. *“I can confirm that the research undertaken at UEA has enabled AB Vista to move from being the 6\-7<sup>th</sup> largest enzyme supplier in the world to number 2\-3 in the last seven years”* \(AB Vista's Research Director \[S1\]\). 

 <ins> *Benefiting the global poultry</ins> <ins>and pig</ins> <ins>industry*</ins>: The impact of **Brearley’s** work extends beyond AB Vista to its customers and competitors in the poultry and pig sectors. For example, industry\-wide adoption of Superdosing and the contribution of inositol to this technique is evidenced in a competitor’s 2017 marketing presentation, which stated, ‘ *Use of Ronozyme® HiPhos increases blood levels of myo\-inositol by a quick break\-down of phytate in the gut*’ \[S6\]. Moreover, phytase sales benefit customers as well as producers. AB Vista’s Global Sales Director has quantified the value of phytate degradation to customers, "" *Estimates suggest the anti\-nutritional effects of phytate could be costing the industry as much as €2 billion* \[EUR2,000,000,000 \(05/2014\)\] *per year in lost performance, and that the potential still to be captured from near\-complete phytate destruction* *is as high as €5* \[EUR5.00 \(05\-2014\)\] *per tonne of feed manufactured”* \[S7\] *.* Lastly, **Brearley**'s research on the role of inositol in the aetiology of two muscle diseases in chicken, ""Woody Breast"" and ""White Striping"" \[R5\], hold potential for substantial future benefits to the industry. As AB Vista's Research Director has stated of **Brearley**'s presentation of this work to an industry conference in Taiwan in 2019, *""The event in Taiwan helped more than one hundred participants… The sales increment could be substantial if we find that dosing two to three times higher than current 'superdosing' norms prove beneficial""* \[S1\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 ‘The French Prisoners at Portchester have fitted up a Theatre in the Castle, which they have decorated in a style far surpassing anything of the kind that could possibly be expected. The Pantomimes which they have brought forward, are not excelled by those performed in London’ \( *Hampshire Telegraph*, January 1811\). 

 Forgotten for 200 years, the Portchester castle theatre has been brought back to life as a result of Astbury’s research which has had a significant impact on the visitor experience, informed the work of the English Heritage interpretation and educational teams and provided a flagship model of collaboration with academia for them. Her research has also served as inspiration for an artist\-devised sound installation and for the National Youth Theatre and is contributing to English Heritage’s broader national strategy of engaging with diverse historical narratives in creative ways. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The British public’s knowledge of France during the period 1789\-1815 is dominated by military history, particularly surrounding the Battle of Waterloo. Astbury’s research gives us a richer appreciation of cultural responses to the Revolution and Napoleon. **Her findings show that even apparently non\-political texts reveal how writers, artists, playwrights and musicians coped with the political and emotional legacy of the French Revolution and of Napoleon’s regime** \(3.1\). She has also shown **how culture played an important part in shaping French debates about identity, nationhood and political legitimacy: it did not simply reflect political events but inflected the public sphere and influenced the calculations made by those on the political scene** \(3.2; 3.5\). 

 Funded by two AHRC grants \(standard research grant 2013\-17 to investigate French theatre of the Napoleonic Era and follow\-on funding 2016\-17 for a project on Staging Napoleonic Theatre\), Astbury’s work on the aesthetics and politics of French theatre 1799\-1815, a traditionally under\-researched field of study, has revealed the deep connections between regime and performance, politics and play text \(3.5; 3.7\). Her research has revealed the significance of Portchester Castle’s unique French prisoner\-of\-war theatre. Astbury and her team interpreted new archival material relating to the depot’s commander, Charles William Paterson, acquired by the V&A theatre collection in 2013. **They found that the prisoners had not only written their own plays in the style of the leading exponent of melodrama, Guilbert de Pixerécourt, but had constructed a fully functioning theatre**, including trap door, fly system for raising and lowering items on stage and the means to send a ‘cherub’ across to the boxes where the captain and his British guests sat \(3.4 and forthcoming article in *Les musiques de scène de Diderot à Hugo*, ed. by Olivier Bara and Patrick Taiëb, Presses Universitaires de Rennes\), features which confirmed 19<sup>th</sup>\-century mémoires’ descriptions of the theatre which had previously been thought to be fanciful boasting. By staging a play written and performed by the prisoners, Astbury revealed that they were exploiting the architecture of the ground floor of the keep to depict characters’ escapes from unjust imprisonment and taking advantage of the acoustics of the space to create a radio play *avant la lettre* so that those prisoners held on the floors above could hear the actors and orchestra. This archival and practical evidence has revolutionised knowledge of the Portchester theatre and French prisoner\-of\-war plays. 

 Astbury is at the forefront of ‘practice as research’ into 19<sup>th</sup>\-century French melodrama. The interaction of music, gesture and text is the hallmark of the genre but, as scores were not published, scholarship has often only considered the play text. Astbury has helped to restore the centrality of music in analysis of early French melodrama and has **found that melodramatic tableaux are dynamic and reactive not static when actors perform the text and its score together** \(3.4; 3.6 and forthcoming article in *Ser prisionero de guerra entre la Ilustración y Napoleón. Una aproximación por casos particulares*, ed. by Evaristo Garrido Martinez, Silex Ediciones\). This research underpinned the performance in situ of the French prisoner\-of\-war melodrama at Portchester Castle and one of Pixerécourt’s *La Forteresse du Danube* \(3.7\) at the Georgian Theatre Royal. 

 Astbury has also worked extensively on using archival material to inspire creative outputs, from stop\-motion videos of Waddesdon Manor’s Revolutionary prints \(3.3\) to the Portchester sound installation as a stimulus for GCSE drama pieces, to the authentic costumes in the Portchester dressing\-up box, and the National Youth Theatre’s Research and Development Zoom sessions, thereby bringing research to new audiences who become co\-producers of artistic responses to the culture of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras.

###  Bringing the Portchester castle theatre back to life 

 Interpretation at Portchester Castle before 2017 concentrated on Roman and medieval history, overlooking the years when it served as French prisoner\-of\-war depot. The significance and rarity of its historic Napoleonic theatre was not understood nor valued. Astbury’s research into this site led to English Heritage showcasing this research in innovative ways with the wider public. Under Astbury’s instruction, the ground floor of the keep was transformed with a recreation of the prisoner\-of\-war theatre. Astbury advised on the design of the recreated theatre and provided original source information for the guide book, the website, the interpretation panels for the new permanent exhibition, and for the costume design for the dressing\-up box, which has proved a great hit with visitors. As English Heritage’s Property Manager explains: ‘Visitors really engage with the space and love to get dressed up in the costumes provided and take a turn on the stage. It encourages impromptu performance and also the use of the *Roseliska* excerpts provided. It appeals to all age groups and visitor feedback is that it gives them a chance to get involved in something that is creative and also something that they wouldn’t normally get the chance to experience. It then also causes them to reflect on something that they consider fun compared to the setting that it’s in \(a prison\) compared to the daily life of those performing on the stage’ \(5.1\). The theatre has also been used by schools and theatre groups, and community groups including nursing homes and the Scouts have expressed an interest in using the space for activities when it becomes safe to do so \(5.1\). 

 


Astbury’s input has completely changed how visitors experience the site. In interviews, visitors to the castle felt that the recreated theatre helped them to understand more effectively the way that the space was used: ‘so many places just go, “ *and this room would have this”*, but you can’t physically imagine what it looks like, so actually having it visually displayed, you kind of get … the sense of scale as well’ \(5.2\). The ground\-floor theatre is now a multi\-functional performance space, used by the Education team and the local community long term. 

 *The ground floor of the keep before \(left\) and after, with its new theatre space* 

 The new permanent exhibition was launched in July 2017 with a public performance of the POW’s melodrama, Roseliska, produced by Astbury and utilising her broader work on melodrama. It was declared 'a triumph of your applied research' by English Heritage's Senior Properties Historian \(5.1\). Music from it is now a part of the site audio guide and visitors are able to act out extracts from the play in costume on the stage. Audience feedback on the performance enthusiastically commented on how it was ‘moving’, ‘enthralling’, and they fully endorsed this way of ‘bringing history to life’, giving a ‘fresh experience’ of a site many thought they knew well. One commented ‘I was blown away by the experience – hadn’t expected it to be so immersive and evocative of the prisoners’ experience here’ \(5.3\). *Roseliska* went on to win the Association for Heritage Interpretation Discover Heritage award in the Events and Activities category in 2019 ‘for in\-depth research, a partnership between the heritage sector and academia, the revelation of an unknown history and creative imagination’ \(judges’ verdict, 5.3\). 

###  Transforming the visitor experience of the castle 

 Portchester’s Property Manager outlined the difference that Astbury's research has made to Portchester Castle: following the installation, the average visit time duration increased from 45 minutes to 90 minutes, and visitor numbers saw an increase of 3.6% over anticipated numbers. Furthermore, English Heritage ‘saw a marked change in the diversity of visitors to site’ \(5.1\). 

 The powerful effect of music and the French language on the audience who watched *Roseliska* in 2017, and the discovery of a Portchester connection to another prisoner\-of\-war play manuscript – about the black revolutionaries of Saint\-Domingue, whose fictional exploits mirrored those of real\-life prisoners of war from the Caribbean held at Portchester in 1796\-97 – led Astbury to collaborate on an artistic sound installation to allow visitors to hear sounds from the castle’s time as POW depot. This included extracts from the prisoners’ plays, letters by and about some of the female black revolutionaries housed at Portchester and the entry registers containing the names of the 2,000 prisoners from the Caribbean. Internationally acclaimed sound artist Elaine Mitchener used Astbury’s research to create a temporary sound installation, |Les Murs Sont Témoins | These Walls Bear Witness| *,* which ran between July and November 2019 in the keep at Portchester. It recounts the castle’s story as a building of incarceration, creativity, and freedom. 

 Mitchener described how the research ‘deepened my understanding and provided further inspiration towards the work…it was exciting to rediscover this period in a new and culturally relevant way’ \(5.4\). She noted the importance of bringing the story of the Caribbean prisoners to a wider audience, because ‘the story is relevant in helping our understanding of black and brown people’s part in shaping European history outside of the slave trade. This work isn’t about victims but freemen and women and their tremendous sense of self against the odds’ \(5.4\). Feedback indicated that ‘it added real, immersive value, and showed a unique perspective to the castle’s history’ \(5.5\). The installation was shortlisted in the Contribution to Heritage category at the Heritage Awards 2020 and featured in the winning English Heritage podcast series, Speaking with Shadows \(5.5\). 

 The Head of Learning at English Heritage has highlighted the significance of the installation for the institution: ‘What was particularly ground\-breaking …was its use of primary source material which was unknown outside of academic spheres and its commitment to helping people develop a personal connection to archives’. For her, the sound installation was an ‘incredibly important artistic intervention for English Heritage’ because the research ‘provided an important framework for the way in which heritage institutions, like English Heritage, can begin to explore underdeveloped, under\-told, “hidden” narratives and difficult histories, such as those of the black Caribbean prisoners of war held at Portchester’ \(5.1\). 

###  Informing the work of the interpretation and educational teams at English Heritage 

 Astbury has significantly extended educational provision at Portchester. Before her collaboration with them began, there was no programme of activities for secondary school pupils. Astbury has spearheaded an extension of the Portchester education programme to include regular workshops with A\-level drama students and site visits for GCSE drama students as a stimulus for artistic creation. The project is also helping to meet English Heritage’s corporate priority of telling diverse histories. English Heritage’s Education Visits Officer called Astbury’s workshops ‘accessible and exciting’ and affirmed that they had enabled English Heritage to ‘to interpret a site and a site's history in a new way and kept us relevant. Your research has also given us the opportunity to work with college and 6<sup>th</sup> form students from various backgrounds that we wouldn't normally have' \(5.1\). 

 Furthermore, in 2020 volunteers and site staff at Portchester were trained by Astbury to better understand the prisoners’ theatre so that they can answer visitor queries and extend the primary school’s programme to include discovery days about the theatre and the Caribbean prisoners. Training was based on melodrama workshops Astbury developed for a Portchester Castle family weekend in August 2017 which ‘added a different, fresh dimension to our event’ according to Portchester’s Property Manager \(5.1\). Astbury is also significantly involved in developing a creative programme that can be used across English Heritage properties in the whole of the south of England. The Education Officer for the South of England is working with Astbury whose ‘enthusiasm, knowledge and passion are invaluable’ to realise ‘the potential for both subject\-specific work in Drama and History but also cross\-curricular work involving English, MFL and art and design departments’ \(5.1\). 

###  Providing a flagship model of collaboration with academia for English Heritage 

 The performance of *Roseliska* and the sound installation have informed English Heritage’s policy on creative programmes. Astbury’s collaboration is seen by the organisation’s Head of Learning and Interpretation as ‘a key relationship for English Heritage’. It is being promoted as a flagship model of engagement with research: ‘These projects have helped to demonstrate to English Heritage and to the wider heritage and culture sector, the outstanding value and potential of academic collaboration and the potential impact of academic research on the heritage sector. What’s more, by producing these creative outputs with Prof Astbury, we hope to demonstrate the wide\-ranging nature of heritage and history and the ways in which people can discover, engage and learn about the past. The model of collaboration which we have developed with Prof Astbury is one we are actively seeking to replicate on other projects across English Heritage as we consider it a paradigm of best practice and a beacon of what such a collaboration can achieve’ \(5.1\). 

 Summer 2020 saw a further development of the collaboration between Astbury and English Heritage, with a co\-conceived project *Freedom and Revolution* in conjunction with the National Youth Theatre \(NYT\), reinterpreting the prisoners’ play about revolution in the Caribbean. A new production is currently in research and development as part of English Heritage’s award\-winning national youth engagement programme Shout Out Loud. The Associate Director of the National Youth Theatre sees Astbury’s research as crucial to the project: ‘the NYT creative team and actors have been offered the magical key of facts and knowledge that can unlock the creative process with true understanding. This subject matter within Freedom and Revolution, at this time is hugely important and our relationship with Kate has been and will continue to be essential to ensure untold stories are illuminated and celebrated’ \(5.6\). 

 The team behind the performance reflected on its development in an online discussion organised by Astbury in November 2020 as part of the Being Human Festival of the Humanities. The Assistant Director described how they were bringing to life one of history’s overlooked stories: ‘black women are usually missing from this history…so much of \[black history\] is centred around just Windrush and slavery’ \(5.7\). The team, along with a group of past NYT actors, spent a week engaging with the research and Mitchener’s sound installation. On seeing the work produced at the end of the week, Mitchener saw ‘a marked change in how they were so confident with their voices…It was a very transformative week, and life enhancing week for me I know, and I'm sure for them’. She summed up her hopes for the legacy of the project: ‘I think it will be carried through each and every person who is involved in the project, that they continue talking about it. That's what keeps the history alive’ \(5.7\).

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Cybercrime is a growing national problem, and the ‘human factor’ is a key cybersecurity vulnerability. Northumbria Cyber Security Research Group \(NCSRG\), recognised as an ‘Academic Centre of Excellence in Cybersecurity’ in 2019, is a cross\-faculty, multi\-disciplinary group investigating human\-centred approaches to cybersecurity. NCSRG’s research has informed key cybersecurity policy documents in the UK and was used by the National Cyber Security Centre for campaigns raising public awareness of cybercrime. Through collaboration with industry \(Think Cyber\), the NCSRG contributed to the development of an award\-winning cybersecurity training product that has been used to train staff at Tesco Bank and the London Borough of Camden Council. Cybersecurity awareness of over 1,000 older people \(a group considered amongst the most vulnerable to cybercrime\) in the North East of England has been increased through the work of the NCSRG with the University of the Third Age. \[text removed for publication\]

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Cybercrime costs the UK economy billions of pounds per year. Northumbria Cyber Security Research Group \(NCSRG\) is a cross\-faculty, multi\-disciplinary group which aims to understand security vulnerabilities which exist at the intersection of people, technology, and place. The group includes Dr James Nicholson from the Department of Computer and Information Sciences, as well as Professor Pamela Briggs and Professor Lynne Coventry from the Department of Psychology, and others. The group combines technical computer science expertise on such topics as web security protocols and image recognition, with human\-centred work on security, privacy, and trust. Nicholson contributes the technical knowledge of digital security mechanisms and countermeasures while investigating the opportunities to improve user\-facing technologies. 

 Most common cybersecurity measures rely on simple authentication mechanisms, such as password or face recognition, that are not always effective in stopping cybercrime. In 2013, NCSRG’s research explored the experiences of older users with text passwords \[ **R1**\], showing that knowledge\-based authentication methods \(passwords and PINs\) were problematic for older people, due to such factors as memory decline. This work demonstrated the importance of tailoring technology to distinct population groups. As a result, the NCSRG team developed more inclusive authentication systems that could benefit both older and younger users by improving the practical entropy of codes without compromising their memorability \[ **R1**\]. 

 With the objective of creating secure online systems that account for human behaviour, NCSRG also looked into the design of user interfaces during the EPRSC\-funded Choice Architecture for Information Security \(ChAISe\) project. The team investigated a choice architecture \(an approach to retaining a user’s right to choose while ‘nudging’ them to make certain choices\) as a mechanism for bridging the technical security countermeasures of organisations and human limitations, by carefully designing user\-facing security interfaces \[ **R2**\]. The effectiveness of ‘nudges’ in helping users to identify social engineering attacks was evaluated, showing that users were more successful in identifying phishing emails when their attention was drawn to the sender’s details \(name and originating email address\). This work highlighted the fact that interfaces hiding sender information in emails \(e.g., full originating email address\) is problematic and potentially hinders users’ efforts to evaluate the authenticity of emails in their everyday lives. 

 While investigating methods to improve cybersecurity, the NCSRG showed that a simple ‘nudge’ towards protective actions \(e.g., a message reminding a user to create a stronger password\) can significantly improve security protections \[ **R3**\]. Refining their work on ‘nudges’, NCSRG researched cybersecurity in the workplace by creating a gamified method of detecting cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This work revealed tensions between corporate approaches to cybersecurity compliance and the attitudes and behaviours of employees \[ **R4**\]. This research showed how online tools can inform the design of successful campaigns and training events that can improve the socio\-technical security of organisations. 

 The common thread running through NCSRG’s research has established that systems designed with diverse communities of users in mind, lead to more secure interactions and better cybersecurity protection. In 2017, in collaboration with the Universities of Bath, Cranfield, and Portsmouth, Northumbria’s team started working on the Cybersecurity Across the Lifespan \(cSALSA\) project, which focused on age\-related vulnerabilities. This work built on NCSRG’s earlier research into difficulties that older adults \(and other communities\) experience when trying to authenticate their identity \(e.g., using passwords and PINs\) \[ **R1**\]. The research found that older people are amongst the most vulnerable to cybercrime, yet they are also the least likely to use online learning sources to increase cybersecurity literacy \[ **R5**\]. The cSALSA project examined the most effective methods of communicating cybersecurity information to older adults, identifying training opportunities and technologies that could facilitate better understanding of these technical concepts \[ **R5**\]. In 2019, NCSRG used this research to develop an EPSRC NetworkPlus funded CyberGuardians project, designed to create community\-based cybersecurity courses in the North East of England, as an intervention to increase cybersecurity awareness. 

 Acknowledging NCSRG’s innovative work in human\-centred cybersecurity, in 2019 the National Cyber Security Centre \(NCSC, the UK’s technical authority for cyber threats\) designated Northumbria University as an ‘Academic Centre of Excellence in Cybersecurity’.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Northumbria Cyber Security Research Group \(NCSRG\) achieved impact in three spheres: informed national cybersecurity policy documents and national campaigns; contributed to the development of the commercial cybersecurity training tools that were utilised with private and public organisations; and raised awareness of cybercrime among over 1,000 older people \(vulnerable to cybercrime group\) in the North East of England, through novel peer\-to\-peer training courses. 

 **4.1. Contribution to cybersecurity policy development and national campaigns in the UK** 

 NCSRG directly informed the government’s approach to cybersecurity in the UK. In 2014, NCSRG members were invited to contribute to a report by the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser on ‘The Internet of Things: making the most of the Second Digital Revolution’ \[ **E1**, Northumbria’s contribution is acknowledged on p38\]. The report set out a vision for the Government’s regulation of data flows created by Internet of Things \(IoT\) technologies, and the research agenda outlined in that report led directly to the establishment of the GBP14,000,000 PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity in 2018. PETRAS considers issues of privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security \[i.e., human\-centred aspects of cybersecurity analysed in **R1**, **R4**, **R5**\] as they relate to IoT devices, systems, and networks. The centre is comprised of a consortium of 16 research institutions, including Northumbria University \[ **E2**\]. Through collaboration with industry and government partners, PETRAS ensures that research is directly applied to benefit society, business, and the economy. 

 NCSRG also shaped national guideline recommendations on the IoT. In 2018, NCSRG joined an academic and industry panel created by the UK Government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport \(DCMS\), to assess how best to ensure that consumer internet\-connected products and associated services are secure. The DCMS report ‘Secure by Design: Improving the cyber security of consumer Internet of Things’ explicitly acknowledged the influence of the cSALSA \[ **R5**\] project as the source of findings that helps Government *‘to design more effective cyber security advice and educational materials that are tailored for different audiences’* \[ **E3**, p27\]. 

 While informing key UK policy documents on cybersecurity, Northumbria’s work also shaped cybersecurity campaigns run by the National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the Government Communications Headquarters, responsible for improving the security of the UK’s online activity through technological improvements and advice to citizens and organisations. National campaigns run since 2015, including ‘People are the strongest link’, ‘You shape security’, and ‘Cyber Aware Campaign’, embedded NCSRG’s findings on how to make cybersecurity available to various groups \[ **R1**, **R5**\], such as senior citizens and employees of private and public organisations \[ **E4**\]. 

 **4.2. Development of novel cybersecurity training products** 

 NCSRG’s work became a key part of award\-winning cybersecurity training products developed by an external company, Think Cyber, which were used by customers including Tesco Bank and the London Borough of Camden Council. In 2018, NCSRG’s research \[ **R2**, **R4**, **R5**\] was used to improve Think Cyber’s Redflags™ product. Tim Ward, CEO and Co\-founder of the Think Cyber, stated: 

 *‘\[Collaboration with Northumbria\] highlighted some key do's and do not's for delivering security awareness that have formed a significant part of our marketing and the narrative behind our unique approach to security awareness: little and often, easy to access, simple and actionable, context driven/real time.* *Redflags™, the product* *that incorporates this work has recently \[2020\] won the SC Award for Best Professional Training Programme’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 Following the refinement of the existing Redflags™ product, Think Cyber and NCSRG secured GBP40,000 Innovate UK funding to create novel cybersecurity awareness training. The need to increase cybersecurity awareness is partly driven by regulations \(e.g., ISO027001, EU NIS Directive\) requiring companies to include cybersecurity courses in their programmes of staff training. The new training product developed in collaboration with Northumbria \(built on **R2** and **R4**\) \[ **E5**\] recognised both the needs and behaviours of the staff who receive such training, and the requirements of enterprise practitioners who are responsible for delivering the training to staff. Tim Ward, CEO and Co\-founder of the Think Cyber, stated: 

 *‘\[We\] established problems with existing training and how it could be improved. We also evaluated the design of four potential approaches that we considered developing in the future. Two particular ideas from this – Security Bulletins and Real\-time tips have evolved into key parts of our product. We are now marketing a NCSC certified set of Security Bulletins \(now named “Stories”\) and have deployed a bespoke version of this to Tesco Bank and Camden Council* \[text removed for publication\] *’* \[ **E5**\]. 

 NCSRG helped the company to develop a strategic vision for their products and to secure an excellent reputation in the field of cybersecurity training \[ **E5**\]. The company was selected for the first cohort of the technology innovation accelerator ‘London Office for Rapid Cybersecurity Advancement’ and was one of only seven \(and only two outside the US\) finalists in the New York City Mayor’s Cyber Moonshot Challenge \[ **E5**\]. 

 **4.3. Reducing the risk of cybercrime targeting older people** 

 Older people form a population group that is amongst the most vulnerable to cybercrime. Many senior citizens are aware of online risks but are often not sure how to protect themselves, which sometimes impedes their use of online tools altogether. In the North East of England, the NCSRG team enhanced the cybersecurity awareness of over 1,000 older people \[ **E6**, **E7**\]. 

 Working with University of Third Age \(U3A\) in the North East of England, in 2017 the NCSRG team organised practical workshops that focused on password management, social engineering, online privacy, social media, privacy implications of GDPR, and online shopping and banking for older people \[based on research on older people’s use of passwords and other authentication methods **R1**, **R5**\]. As a result of these workshops, over 240 older people increased their awareness of cybersecurity \[ **E6**\]. Following the workshops, due to positive feedback and high demand, the team decided to create a peer\-to\-peer programme that would allow members of the community to train their peers in cybersecurity. The innovative CyberGuardians project was launched in 2019 by the NCSRG team in collaboration with the U3A and the Old Low Light Heritage Centre. During the project, NCSRG designed and delivered training to 14 CyberGuardians from across the region \(Whitley Bay, Prudhoe, Newcastle, Gateshead, Northallerton, Teesside, Tynemouth\) – older people who disseminated cybersecurity messages within their communities. The U3A report stated: 

 *‘Up until the end of September 2020, the CyberGuardians helped approximately 820 people with cybersecurity advice and help… This is an amazing achievement for the 14 CyberGuardians, but even more people can still benefit from their knowledge. The CyberGuardians have been particularly active organising training sessions during the current UK Covid\-19 lockdown, given the 400% increase in Coronavirus scams during this period, but are looking to continue helping as many people as possible’* \[ **E7**\]. 

 Counting the initial cybersecurity workshops and the CyberGuardians’ training, over 1,000 hard to reach and vulnerable \(to cybercrime\) older people in the North East benefitted from NCSRG’s work. Mike Martin, former U3A Northumbria Regional Committee Member and a CyberGuardian, stated: 

 *‘The message of good security practices is better received when it comes from people that they \[older people\] trust, and it is incredible to see the positive impact that a few individuals have had on the general online protection of older adults in the North East of England. This improved protection and awareness would not have been possible without Northumbria University’* \[ **E6**\].

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 In 2014, as a response to research undertaken by UCL’s  [Pond Restoration Research Group](https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/research/research-centres/pond-restoration-research) \(PRRG\) identifying the actions necessary to restore pond biodiversity in UK lowland farmland, Sayer initiated the multi\-partner Norfolk Ponds Project \(NPP\). Underpinned by PRRG science, the NPP has delivered over 200 successful pond restorations, as well as enabling tens of farmers to restore their own ponds, and educating conservation practitioners on pond restoration delivery. It directly inspired and supported the formation of similar projects in Suffolk and Gloucestershire and changed the strategic priorities of the National Trust’s ‘Riverlands’ project. The NPP has raised public awareness of the importance of farmland pond restoration through considerable positive media attention reaching an audience of over 2 million. It has also influenced the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ \(DEFRA\) national environmental policy and Natural England’s new English District Level Licensing \(DLL\) approach for Great Crested Newt \(GCN\) mitigation. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prof Carl Sayer formed the UCL Pond Restoration Research Group \(PRRG\) in 2012 to provide a scientific evidence base to inform UK pond conservation and restoration practices. It includes staff members \(Carl Sayer, Jan Axmacher, Helen Bennion, Helene Burningham\) and researchers with combined expertise in aquatic ecology, palaeoecology, landscape\-scale conservation, aquatic ecological restoration and stakeholder engagement. 

 Since the 1950s many UK farmland ponds have been deliberately in\-filled to reclaim land creating so\-called “ghost ponds”, while, due to a parallel cessation of traditional pond management, involving tree and sediment removal, remaining UK farmland ponds have become increasingly overgrown and shaded by trees \(terrestrialisation\). In 2012, a pioneering PRRG paper compared biological diversity across a set of farmland ponds managed by traditional tree and sediment removal with a set of overgrown tree\-covered ponds in the surrounding area **\[R1\]** It showed that biological diversity was significantly higher in the managed ponds compared to the unmanaged highly\-terrestrialised ponds. This was thought to be due to the development of dense and diverse aquatic plant communities in the managed ponds **\[R1\]**. Thus, a blueprint for a successful landscape\-scale approach to farmland pond restoration and conservation – centred on tree and sediment removal – was established. 

 A further landmark paper arising from early PRRG research focused on the potential for restoring three ghost ponds deliberately in\-filled by farmers between 1839\-1883 and in the 1960s and 1970s **\[R2\]**. The ghost ponds were re\-excavated and field surveys found them to support abundant and diverse aquatic plant communities after just six months. Parallel experimental work using on\-site mesocosms \(mini\-ponds next to the restored ponds\) and microcosms \(tanks in a greenhouse setting\) explained the rapidity of plant response, showing germination of at least eight aquatic plant species from long\-lived seeds in the sediments of the ponds following as much as 150 years of enforced dormancy **\[R2\]**. Thus, ghost ponds are indeed, as the term suggests, never quite dead due to the presence of seed banks \(effectively time capsules\) viable on centennial time\-scales underneath cropped fields. 

 More recent PRRG research has investigated the benefits of restoring farmland ponds for “terrestrial” species, demonstrating hitherto little understood aquatic\-terrestrial linkages between ponds, farmland birds and pollinator communities. A year\-round study of farmland bird use of recently restored ponds and typical highly\-terrestrialised ponds showed bird abundance and species richness, as well as foraging and parental behaviour, to be significantly higher at restored ponds **\[R3\]**. Follow\-up work showed that the mechanism underpinning this finding was an 18\-fold \(on average\) higher abundance of emerging aquatic insects at restored open\-canopy ponds in comparison to their unmanaged tree\-covered counterparts **\[R4\]**. A study of pollinators, again comparing restored and overgrown terrestrialised farmland ponds, showed substantial benefits of pond restoration for wildflower resources and associated day\-time pollinating insects **\[R5\]**. Thus, the research concluded that restoration of ponds in farmland may help to reverse well known and much publicised declines in bird and pollinator communities in UK farmland, the latter of which threatens crop production. Overall research undertaken by the PRRG at UCL provides a strong science evidence base to support the benefits of pond restoration and management in UK lowland farmland **\[R6\]**.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 **Restoring ponds, raising awareness of the importance of pond conservation and inspiring conservation organizations to restore ponds** 

 The Norfolk Ponds Project \(NPP\), initially established by Sayer and PhD candidate Greaves in 2014, is a partnership between UCL, local farmers, Norfolk County Council, Natural England, Anglian Water, Norfolk Farming & Wildlife Advisory Group \(FWAG\) and 5 NGOs. It has received funding support from UCL and its partner organisations. Drawing on PRRG research, the NPP was set up with two major aims: 1\) to restore and conserve ponds in the county of Norfolk for the benefit of wildlife conservation, and; 2\) to engage and educate farmers and the public, as well as conservation professionals and policy\-makers, on the importance of pond management for biodiversity conservation. 

 Since 2014, the NPP team has restored \(by major tree and sediment removal\) over 200 highly terrestrialised farmland ponds in Norfolk with consequent direct improvements in the environment. Restorations are undertaken either as part of events combining all NPP partners or by a small dedicated NPP team, consisting of a chainsaw expert and digger operator. PRRG members Sayer and Greaves provide expert guidance, based on research findings, to inform the ‘what and how’ of all pond restorations. Studies of pond restorations delivered by the UCL PRRG show significant landscape\-scale increases in aquatic diversity for a range of aquatic and terrestrial biological groups **\[R1\-R5\]**. Further, a number of rare and threatened species have colonised NPP restored ponds, including the schedule 8 \(under UK Wildlife & Countryside Act, 1981\) species Holly\-leaved Naiad *Najas marina* and Grass\-poly *Lythrum hyssopifolia*, the latter of which had not been recorded in Norfolk for a century. NPP restorations have thus far resulted in 13 new Norfolk pond populations of the nationally rare schedule 5 \(under UK Wildlife & Countryside Act, 1981\) Great Crested Newt \(GCN\) *Triturus cristatus* and 17 new pond populations of the nationally threatened Crucian Carp *Carassius carassius*, a Norfolk Biodiversity Action Plan \(BAP\) species **\[R6\]**. 

 In addition to restoring ponds, the NPP has led to and informed \(providing advice and know\-how via events and visits to farms\) pond restoration work in Norfolk, as well as more widely in Gloucestershire, Lancashire and Suffolk. For example, in May and September 2019, working for the NPP, the UCL PRRG ran two day\-long events aimed at educating farmers and farm conservation advisors in Norfolk \(total 42 participants\) on the rationale and processes of farmland pond restoration. As a consequence, farmer members of the Upper Wensum Cluster Farm Group \(Norfolk\) were inspired to undertake 23 self\-funded pond restorations in autumn 2019 with a further 20 undertaken in autumn 2020. Commenting on the 2019 work, the Farm Advisor for the Cluster, noted that the collaboration gave the farm cluster “a heightened academic understanding which motivated us to restore as many ponds in our landscape” **\[A\]**. She observed that: “This is an achievement considering that some farmers have highly conventional and intensive agricultural outlooks with little interest in pond restoration” **\[A\]**. UCL PRRG\-run farmer events in Gloucestershire led to some 10 pond restorations being undertaken by the Seven Vale Guardians Cluster Farm Group and conservation NGO The Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust \(WWT\). As WWT’s Wetland Science Manager states “the research work undertaken by UCL has been vital in advancing our understanding of UK pond loss and has been pivotal in identifying practical and sustainable solutions that can be communicated with landowners” **\[B\]**. 

 PRRG research changed the strategic priorities of the National Trust’s GBP13,000,000 ‘Riverlands’ catchment conservation project. The Project Manager for the Riverlands Upper Bure project in Norfolk explained that the PRRG’s “essential research into the ecosystem wide benefits of ponds, and the success of ghost pond resurrection has helped the National Trust and Riverlands Program to see the benefits of ponds within our landscape scale project” **\[C\]**. As a consequence, The National Trust made the decision to include pond restoration in Riverlands and funded the NPP to deliver 50 pond restorations for the Upper Bure project. The Project Manager for the Riverlands Upper Bure project explains that the collaboration with the NPP: “has helped us establish new ways of approaching our targets for priority habitat restoration” and added that this links “well with the National Trust Strategy for healthy, beautiful, more natural environments as well as fulfilling Lawton’s guiding principles” **\[C\]**. The collaboration has thus far delivered 22 Riverlands pond restorations, with further work planned for 2021 and 2022. Finally, in 2020, inspired by the NPP, the Suffolk Wildlife Trust \(SWT\) formed a Suffolk Ponds Project **\[D\]**. As SWT’s Farmland Wildlife Adviser stated “The input and encouragement of UCL staff engaged with the Norfolk project has been instrumental in establishing this group in May 2020 and guiding our early thinking” **\[D\]**. In 2019 the NPP’s positive influence on conservation organisations, and in particular the translation of UCL science to good conservation practice, was recognised by the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management \(CIEEM\) who awarded them their ‘NGO Impact’ award. 

 The PRRG has run outreach events \(field workshops, open days, talks, seminars, webinars, agricultural shows, citizen science initiatives\) which have educated farmers, conservation practitioners, policy\-makers and the public on pond restoration and its under\-valued importance in farmland conservation, engaging 3700 individuals **\[R6\]**. Before and after questionnaires indicate major positive advances in terms of understanding and practical know\-how on pond restoration best practice **\[Fig. 4 in R6\]**. One Norfolk Farmer who attended NPP events commented: “I had looked into restoring ponds on my land through the countryside stewardship scheme before I heard about the Ghost Pond Project but I was put off by the cost and advice to leave the pond alone and just coppice trees along the bank to let light in” **\[E\]**. After attending NPP events he went on to restore ponds in 2013 as part of the Ghost Ponds Project **\[R2\]** and latterly in 2014 and 2015 by himself. He sees the restorations as part of his legacy: “knowing that you might leave a farm in a better condition than you started, well that’s a fantastic thing to achieve” **\[E\]**. 

 Volunteers who participate in restorations benefit by learning new skills. The PRRG’s “Great Twin Pond Dig \- GTPD” \(2016\-19\), funded by the British Ecological Society **\(ii\)**, twinned local people \(20 participants in total\) in Norfolk and Lancashire and involved them with before and after studies of farmland pond restoration, and asked them to adopt their local ponds. One volunteer explained that their group of 8 GTPD volunteers from Bodham, Norfolk “gained a tremendous amount of knowledge” **\[F\]**. The volunteer said participants “learn\[t\] new practical and scientific skills for the monitoring and observations required”. The group has become self\-sustaining: “Even though the project is now finished, the group continues to organise and undertake management through work parties at the restored ponds” **\[F\]**. 

 The importance and value of pond restoration has been transmitted to a large public audience of over 2 million in the UK, America and Japan via printed and online media and interviews with Sayer and Greaves on TV and radio **\[G\]**. Features in Farmers Guardian in April **\[A/B\]**, in print and online in New Scientist **\[R2\]** and The Conversation **\[R2\]** in 2017 reached an audience of 160,225 **\[G\]**. The NPP’s 2019 “Big50” pond restoration project reached a global audience through coverage in The Telegraph, Mail Online, Japan Times, Japan News, Miami Herald, on BBC Look East and BBC Radio 4 ‘Farming Today’ and by the Associated Press who featured the project in their “What Can Be Saved” conservation film series \(19 November 2019 \- viewed 36,772 times on YouTube\) **\[G\]**. In February 2020, Sayer and Greaves explained the benefits of restoring farmland ponds **\[R1\-5\]** in a 22 minute programme for the Radio 4 “On Your Farm” series \(live listenership 720,000\), as well as a 30 minute Radio 4 “Open Country” programme in October 2020 \(listenership 1 million\). In November 2020 Sayer was interviewed on the finding of the nationally rare wetland plant Grass\-poly in a NPP restored pond on BBC News 24 and this story was also covered on BBC Breakfast **\[G\]**. 

 **Raising the profile of pond restoration in the UK conservation and policy agenda and changing DEFRA and Natural England policy** 

 In 2016 Natural England issued the report “Narrative for Conserving Freshwater and Wetland Habitats in England” **\[H\]**, which cited 3 PRRG papers, including **\[R1\]**. This important report outlines the evidence basis and philosophical framework for English freshwater and wetland habitat conservation, underpins key work\-streams for protected sites, and sets out conservation ambitions and delivery mechanisms for important legislative drivers, including the UK’s response to Biodiversity 2020, the EC Water Framework Directive and current and evolving agri\-environment schemes \(AES\), including the current Countryside Stewardship scheme. In a section on ‘Key Management Messages’ the Narrative states that “in agricultural landscapes where there is less land available for pond creation, active management of the pond resource, involving partial scrub and sediment removal, can ensure that early successional ponds and the biodiversity they support remain part of the landscape”. Inclusion of **\[R1\]** in the Narrative has helped to solidify the importance of farmland pond restoration in the delivery of effective landscape\-scale conservation in England leading to inclusion in key environmental policy developments. 

 PRRG research has changed the new English District Level Licensing \(DLL\) policy approach for Great Crested Newt \(GCN\) mitigation. As a protected species GCN presence within and close to proposed development sites has to be mitigated for. As part of the UK Government’s 25 Year Plan to Improve the Environment **\[I\]** a new DLL approach was highlighted as an innovative example of ‘net gain’ implementation, with districts empowered to use money from developers to create additional GCN habitat. As initially set up, creation of new ponds dominated the new DLL, with little consideration of the potential role of pond restoration **\[I**, **pp. 142\]**. However, as a result of PRRG evidence, in 2019, restoration and management were added as a key net gain pond option in the DLL. Natural England Habitat’s Delivery Strategist for the DLL project, explained that: “Norfolk Ponds Project restoration works have proved extremely helpful in informing the habitat delivery elements of Natural England’s GCN District Level Licensing project. In particular, you have illustrated that restoring ponds within the wider landscape has an important role to play alongside pond creation. Clearly the techniques you have used, and your careful decision making with regards to pond selection and restoration prescriptions, have added greatly to our knowledge base. We have used this to strengthen our pond specifications which are being used to deliver 400\+ ponds across England this year” **\[J\]**. 

 PRRG research on pond restoration and resurrection **\[R1/R2\]** and the benefits of pond restoration for farmland birds **\[R3/R4\]** and pollinators **\[R5\]**, has been, and is currently being used, to influence agri\-environment policy. For example, in 2016, the UK Government introduced the Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package to its Countryside Stewardship programme, which rewards landowners who adopt it. As a result of PRRG pond\-pollinator research **\[R5\]**, the package now includes the edges of ponds. As the Standing Waters Senior Specialist for Natural England, stated: “The research evidence base you have produced has been fed into the development of agri\-environment schemes and it continues to influence them, providing further justification for pond restoration to be funded. An example of this is the inclusion of pond buffers in the Wild Pollinator and Farm Wildlife Package, a decision that was informed by UCL’s work” **\[J\]**. In 2020 Natural England invited Sayer and Greaves to produce pond conservation guidance \(in collaboration with the Freshwater Habitats Trust\) to inform DEFRA’s forthcoming \(2024\) in\-development Environmental Land Management \(ELM\) scheme. The guidance will inform participants and advisors concerned with ELM regarding pond creation, restoration and management and will shape the way that farmland pond conservation is undertaken in England for many years to come. 

 **By demonstrating that restoration significantly enhances biodiversity in and around these waterbodies, UCL PRRG research has shown that the UK’s formerly forgotten farmland ponds are critical to the nation’s nature conservation strategy.**

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research carried out by Professor Walton was used in Parliament and by professional and trade bodies to inform a public debate and caused the Government to delay the implementation of its policy on how insolvency litigation should be funded. The Jackson Reforms to Civil Justice in the UK were adopted wholesale by the UK Government. They cut across every area of litigation. Walton’s research argued for an insolvency exception to the Jackson Reforms and received widespread support in Parliament and from business. The research also formed the basis of a very public debate between Walton and Lord Justice Jackson. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The Impact in this case study is underpinned by three reports, which were commissioned by insolvency professional and trade bodies \[R1, R2 and R3\]. The research underpinning each report uniquely and originally investigated the use of Conditional Fee Agreements \(CFAs\) and third party funding in insolvency litigation. Parliament passed the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act \(LASPO\) in 2012, which adopted the recommendations of Jackson LJ, who had recommended a ban on the recoverability of CFA uplifts. Under a CFA, a claimant’s legal team is only paid if the case is won. In addition to their basic fee, they are also entitled to a percentage uplift on the fee. Prior to the Jackson reforms this uplift, as well as the basic fee, was recoverable by a successful claimant from a losing defendant. The research looked at the likely effect of the Jackson reforms on the unique case of insolvency. No such research had ever been carried out before nor has any such research been carried out by others since. 

 The research examined the public policy nature of insolvency litigation and argued in favour of the continued use of recoverability of CFA uplifts in such actions. It traced the history of how insolvency litigation had been funded in the past and how it operated in 2014. It identified the unique nature of private insolvency litigation as having a significant public interest. 

 Uniquely, the research \[R1, R2 and R3\] includes empirical findings on the use of CFAs and third party funding in insolvency. A major part of the research involved surveys being carried out of the entire insolvency profession to assess how practitioners funded insolvency litigation. 

 The importance of the research was recognised by the Insolvency Service, which granted Walton access to its records of all the statutory sanctions requests relating to insolvency. This access enabled Walton to create a large database from which it was possible to estimate the annual value of insolvency claims realised by CFAs in 2014 was GBP160,000,000. 

 The research \[R1\] produced several Findings \[F\] and concluded that: 

 <ins>F1.</ins> The loss of CFA recoverability in insolvency claims would have a significantly negative impact on the amount of litigation being taken on behalf of creditors and, consequently, advocated a reversal of policy by the Government or at least a delay until other suitable mechanisms could be put in place. 

 <ins>F2.</ins> Any alternative funding mechanism, such as that provided by third parties, would reduce the value realised for creditors, and 

 <ins>F3.</ins> The loss of CFA recoverability would increase the minimum size of claims being enforced on behalf of creditors. 

 Jackson LJ’s subsequent public lecture \[C8\] advocated implementation of his recommendations without any exceptions. An updated research report \[R2\] was produced by Walton over the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. It found that the annual value of claims being pursued by CFA\-backed insolvency litigation had risen to GBP1,000,000,000. 

 The third report \[R3\] by Walton in 2020 provides evidence that the main findings in \[R1\] have proved to be correct with a reduction in the value of CFA\-backed claims being pursued \(down to GBP800,000,000\) \[F1\] and less value reaching creditors \[F2\] with only relatively large claims being pursued \[F3\].

###  3. References to the research 

 The following research outputs were authored by Walton. Each is a substantial research report of over 20,000 words in length and have been through a rigorous peer\-review process. Each has been positively received and widely supported by their respective professional funders. R1 received the practical support of the Insolvency Service and has been the subject of Parliamentary and judicial debates.

The effect of the Jackson reforms on insolvency litigation remains a significant policy issue relevant in every insolvency. The results show that CFA\-backed insolvency litigation has diminished by 20% and that less money is nowadays returned to creditors than before the Jackson reforms. The results support the conclusions reached by R1 and R2. 

 In each case, the research underpinning R1, R2 and R3 was conducted with the regular and rigorous guidance of different groups of experienced professional practitioners including judges.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 The impact has been materially to change Government policy in its support of the Jackson reforms in the context of insolvency litigation and to inform a public debate, a process that has continued right up until the present. 

 The research was recognised and supported by significant stakeholder groups; by Parliamentarians and ultimately by the Government of the day. The research examines how best to fund legal actions to return up to GBP1,000,000,000 of creditors’ money per annum. It affects the financial interests of every creditor of an insolvent company or debtor. It argued for an insolvency exception to the Jackson reforms which the Government initially put into effect. Despite a later Government reversal of policy, the research continues to inform persistent representations by the legal and insurance sectors for the retraction of the reversion. 

 <ins>I1. Impact – Informing the Public Debate</ins> 

 The research \[R1\], \[R2\] and \[R3\] was sponsored by the insolvency profession. Support from stakeholder groups for the recommendations in the first report \(\[R1\]\) was overwhelming \[F1\-3\]. Support was provided in letters to various ministers \(signed on behalf of many professional and trade bodies including R3, ACCA, ICAEW, ICAS, IPA, ILA, FSB, Bar Council, ABI, BPF and CIM \(\[C1, C6 and C10\]\). 

 The research impact to the effective administering of justice in the context of insolvency litigation was thereby recognised explicitly by all of these bodies, each of which has experience and knowledge of how the system operates. They are all major stakeholders in insolvency litigation and all supported the research. 

 The value of the research was recognised by the then Under Secretary for BIS, Jo Swinson MP, in a letter to Walton dated 08 December 2014 \[C3\]. The research was referred to on numerous occasions in ministerial questions \(e.g. \[C2\]\) and was the subject of two well\-supported Early Day Motions \[C4 and C9\]. 

 <ins>I2</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Impact – Change of Government Policy</ins> 

 The Government changed its policy on the basis of the research findings \[F1\-3\]. It can be seen that the insolvency exception to the Jackson reforms was extended as a direct result of efforts highlighting the research. These culminated in January 2015 with the first Early Day Motion \[C4\] and the Parliamentary debate \[C5\] where the Minister agreed to an urgent meeting with the R3 Policy Group after discussing the findings of the research. A further letter to the Justice Secretary dated 23 February 2015 \[C6\] was swiftly followed by the announcement of the Government’s change of policy very shortly thereafter on 26 February 2015 \[C7\]. 

 The research had led to a change of Government policy making the return of up to GBP1,000,000,000 of creditors’ money in insolvencies per annum far more likely. 

 <ins>I3</ins><ins>.</ins> <ins>Impact – Government Policy Reverts</ins> 

 In October 2015 Walton met with Ministry of Justice officials. The second update report \[R2\] had been commissioned by then. 

 Jackson LJ, who did not favour any exception to his reforms to all civil litigation devoted his entire Mustill lecture in October 2015 \[C8\] to arguing why the research findings should not be acted upon. 

 The update report \[R2\] continued the public debate by addressing the points made by Jackson LJ in his Mustill lecture. It was published in April 2016 but came too late to influence the Government’s decision in December 2015 to revert to its original policy and to end the insolvency exemption from the Jackson reforms without explanation or further discussion. 

 Walton subsequently met with the Ministry of Justice in July 2016 where he was informed that although the accuracy of the research was not disputed, the Ministry was not able, as a matter of policy decided by the then Secretary of State, to recognise it. 

 Walton’s findings and impact within the sector are further underlined by the Manolete Report \[R3\], where the veracity and authority of \[R1\] and \[R2\] have been supported. 

 <ins>Impact – Summary</ins> 

 Evidence informed a very public debate \[I1\] on a most significant and practical problem affecting at least GBP1,000,000,000 of creditor money each year. The Government was persuaded to alter its policy \[I2\] albeit only temporarily. The public debate continued \[I3\]. The insolvency profession had an additional year to prepare for the Jackson reforms. This led to a further year’s increased returns to insolvent estates which was brought to an end by the Government in 2016.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Excess dietary sodium is a major public health problem worldwide. In 2013 Professor **George** showed for the first time that long\-term consumption of sodium\-containing effervescent, soluble and dispersible medications caused significant increases in cardiovascular events and incident hypertension. These findings were adopted by the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency. The labelling, Summary of Product Characteristics and patient leaflets of such medications manufactured, sold or consumed in Europe must now warn consumers of the associated risk and state their sodium content. Subsequent analysis has shown prescribing of these medications to have reduced significantly since 2013. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The causal link between sodium intake and cardiovascular risk is well established. By the early 2000s, considerable efforts were being made to reduce population salt intake via the diet. **George**, however, recognised that a significant sodium load can be ingested via certain medications such as effervescent, dispersible and soluble formulations. The recommended sodium intake for an adult in the UK is 2.4 g per day \(104 mmol\). However, dispersible and effervescent formulations of paracetamol \(500 mg\) can contain as much as 18.6 mmol and 16.9 mmol of sodium per tablet respectively; the maximum daily dose of eight tablets therefore results in the ingestion of 148 mmol and 135 mmol of sodium respectively **\[R1\]**. This, when added to a typical Western diet, could result in very high sodium intake; however, before **George**’s work there was no requirement to highlight it with a warning in labelling or prescribing advice. 

 Irrespective of the associated anion, sodium loading is detrimental in terms of circulating volume expansion, potentially leading to hypertension and other downstream cardiovascular events, particularly stroke and myocardial infarction. The major impact of sodium ingestion on hypertension results from increased Na<sup>\+</sup> re\-absorption in the renal tubules via Na<sup>\+</sup>\-water exchange; diuresis is therefore the cornerstone of hypertension management in salt\-sensitive patients. Sodium loading of healthy individuals impairs vascular endothelial function, left ventricular relaxation and cardiac repolarisation. Some of these effects may be independent of blood pressure in hypertensive patients. 

 In 2013, **George** and colleagues published a nested case\-control study in a validated general practice database of 1.29 million UK residents **\[R2\]**. Cases \(n = 61,072\) who received at least two prescriptions of a sodium\-containing effervescent, soluble or dispersible medication between January 1987 and December 2010 were compared with an equal number of well\-matched controls prescribed medications containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredients in non\-effervescent/soluble/dispersible form. The mean follow\-up time was 7.23 years. The median sodium consumption from sodium\-containing medications alone in the study was 2.5 g/day, exceeding the current recommended sodium daily intake of 2.4 g/day **\[R3\]**. 

 The study identified a seven\-fold increase in the risk of developing hypertension \(odds ratio 7.18; 95% confidence interval 6.74 to 7.65\), a 16% increase in a composite primary endpoint of incident non\-fatal myocardial infarction, non\-fatal stroke or vascular death, a 22% increase in risk of incident stroke and a 28% increase in all\-cause mortality **\[R2\]**. The key difference between the cases and controls was their sodium intake via effervescent, soluble and dispersible medications. 

 A test for linear trends identified a significant trend in the dose\-response relationship. When a propensity analysis was performed to account for prescription bias the propensity scores for cases and controls were very similar \(0.93 vs 0.92\). 

 This study suggested that physicians should prescribe sodium\-containing formulations with caution and avoid administering them to patients at risk of hypertension. Furthermore, patients prescribed these formulations should be carefully monitored for the emergence of hypertension.

###  4. Details of the impact 

 Before 2013 the risks of long\-term consumption of sodium\-containing effervescent, soluble and dispersible medications had not been characterised and manufacturers were not required to highlight the sodium content of prescription or over\-the\-counter medications. **George**’s work **\[R2\]** therefore highlighted an important but overlooked source of ingested sodium. Subsequently, information campaigns, regulatory action and lobbying ensured proper labelling of sodium\-containing formulations to help prescribing professionals and consumers of over\-the\-counter products make informed decisions when choosing which products to use. 

 **Changes in prescribing as a direct result of George’s work** 

 Analysis of prescribing trends using The Health Improvement Network \(THIN\) and Prescription Cost Analysis databases indicated that **George**’s publication **\[R2\]** influenced prescribing practices for sodium\-containing medications in the UK **\[E1\]**. Interrupted time series analysis of THIN data showed that the monthly prescribing rate of sodium\-containing formulations was stable between 2009 and 2013; however, following publication of \[ **R2\]** the slope reduced significantly by 0.26 per month \(95% confidence interval \-0.45 to \-0.07; p=0.009\). The slope for non\-sodium standard formulations did not change. 

 **Regulatory and labelling changes** 

 **George**’s work triggered action on salt in effervescent medications at both UK and EU level; according to the Director of Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines, MHRA **\[E2\]**: 

 The paper was evaluated and discussed at several of the Agency’s Commission on Human Medicines \(CHM\) Expert Advisory Groups \(EAGs\) in 2013/2014…There was agreement that the labelling of sodium in product information at the time of the paper, did not provide meaningful information to guide clinicians, pharmacists or patients and help them choose appropriate medicines in terms of sodium content. 

 All Expert Groups advised that the high levels of sodium in some medicines, particularly those that dissolve, should be highlighted in the product information of all medicines containing different levels of total sodium. 

 The UK presented the issue and its expert advice to several European bodies in 2014/2015 including the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee \(PRAC\), the Excipients Drafting Group \(ExcpDG\), the European Medicines Agency’s Paediatric Committee \(EMA’s PDCO\) and the Co\-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures \(CMDh\). 

 **George**’s results were also highlighted in a report presented to the UK Parliament in 2015 by the Commission on Human Medicines and the British Pharmacopoeia Commission **\[E3\]**. 

 Responding to **George**’s findings, the EMA commissioned a Europe\-wide signal detection programme to assess the impact of sodium\-containing medications on cardiovascular health. In 2015 the PRAC published new guidance for sodium labelling and recommended an update to the EMA Excipient Guidelines **\[E4, E5\]**. 

 In October 2017 the European Commission updated its Excipient Guideline to require all Marketing Authorisation Holders to submit Variation Documentation within 12 months. The labelling of medicines manufactured, sold or consumed in Europe now features warnings about the effects of sodium loading with prolonged use. For medications exceeding 17 mmol/tablet the Summary of Product Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet must both state how much sodium they contain. 

 **Impacts on professionals – doctors, prescribers, pharmacists and dispensers** 

 **George**’s work and the consequent change in labelling regulations have triggered changes in prescribing advice which have been promulgated internationally via websites aimed at prescribing professionals \(e.g. \[ **E6\]**\) and influenced recent updates to NICE Guidance; for example, the August 2020 update to NICE guidance on “Analgesia \- mild\-to\-moderate pain” **\[E7\]** contains a scenario on paracetamol which advises: 

 Avoid effervescent preparations of paracetamol where possible, particularly in people with hypertension, heart failure, and renal failure — if oral paracetamol is required in a person with swallowing difficulty, use paracetamol suspension in place of effervescent preparations \(which contains up to 6 g salt in a 4 g per 24 hours dose\). 

 \[text removed for publication\] 

 **Impacts on consumers/patients** 

 Educating clinicians about the risks of consuming high\-salt containing medications helps to protect patients receiving them by prescription; however, many over\-the\-counter effervescent medications also contain high salt concentrations. Package labelling and inserts must now provide consumers of over\-the\-counter products with the information they need in order to make an informed decision about their use \(e.g. **\[E9\]**\). 

 **Influence on the wider debate on dietary sodium intake** 

 In 2014 **George** was invited to join Consensus Action on Salt and Health \(CASH, now called Action on Salt **\[E10\]**\). This group of 25 internationally recognised scientific experts has persuaded the Department of Health \(England\) to mandate a further 10% reduction in salt thresholds from its 2012 targets with the aim of saving 6000 lives each year. 

 The Director of Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines at the MHRA confirms that **George**’s study “raised an important potential public health issue” **\[E2\]**. European Medicines Labelling Legislation changed as a result, thus reducing the prescribing of potentially harmful high\-sodium medications, ensuring the provision of better information to consumers of over\-the\-counter medications and contributing to efforts to reduce dietary sodium intake worldwide.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Brunel’s research was incorporated into a toolkit that directly informed planning decisions for 2 

 NHS trusts \(LNWH and Hillingdon\), including 6 hospitals serving 1,290,000 citizens. LNWH used the simulations to plan COVID\-19 capacity and service recovery, informing the pace and scale of health service provision and capacity expansion in response to pandemic waves, benefitting approximately 4,000 COVID\-19 patients and improving the well\-being and working conditions for approximately 2,600 hospital staff. This led to the trusts being able to treat 2.3 times more COVID\-19 patients in their hospitals at the end of 2020, compared to the first wave capacity, and helped prevent medical services in West London being overwhelmed. The toolkit was also applied to analyse CovidSim on behalf of the Royal Society, with the findings contributing towards a shift by SAGE away from reliance on single codes. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Brunel researchers created an epidemiological simulation toolkit for large\-scale COVID\-19 

 forecast analysis. The toolkit relies on a combination of agent\-based modelling algorithms to 

 reproduce individual behaviours, ensemble simulations to efficiently account for statistical noise 

 and counterfactuals and automated access to large supercomputers \(such as the Eagle 

 supercomputer in Poznan \(PL\), and the SuperMUC\-NG computer in Garching \(DE\)\) to facilitate 

 the rapid and reliable execution of these complex workflows. The research work performed to 

 establish the toolkit comprises two main themes: one concerning the Flu And Coronavirus 

 Simulator \(FACS\) and one concerning the VECMA toolkit for facilitating robust and reproducible 

 simulations on the high end computing scale. 

 The FACS code **\[REF1\]** has been developed from the ground up, and uses an agent\-based 

 modelling algorithm with people represented as individual agents in conjunction with local 

 mapping data, demographic information and disease information. FACS serves to forecast the spread of Covid\-19 in a local environment, such as a borough in London or a different city or region in the UK. The code has been validated against hospitalisation data of the first wave of COVID\-19 from two NHS Trusts: London North West University Healthcare \(LNWH\) and Hillingdon Hospitals, and has shown good agreement with that validation data. The code also supports a wide range of public health interventions, such as social distancing, mask wearing and the closing of locations by type. To run FACS robustly, we perform ensemble simulations that cater for a large number of intervention scenarios, while also testing the sensitivity of key assumptions in specific forecasts, and accounting for the aleatory uncertainty in the code **\[REF6\]**. The FACS code has been developed in collaboration with the HiDALGO Centre of Excellence project \(https://hidalgo\-project.eu\) and is currently applied to simulate COVID\-19 spread in Madrid as part of that project. 

 The VECMA toolkit **\[REF2\]**, co\-developed by Groen and the VECMA Consortium, facilitates rapid and robust verification, validation, uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis for a wide range of scientific applications. It is used by researchers across 8 different application domains, and it enables the team at Brunel to quickly run large ensembles of simulations using remote supercomputers \(using the FabSim component **\[REF4\]**\), and enables them to rapidly identify key uncertainties in the simulations, and parameters to which the simulations outcomes are most sensitive \(using the EasyVVUQ component **\[REF3\]**\). We also used the ensemble execution approach in VECMAtk to analyse the sensitivities and limitations of the CovidSim code **\[REF5\]**, which has been consulted for policy decision making by the UK government through the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies \(SAGE\). We found that the code derives 70% of its sensitivity from only 4 out of the 940 parameters and that the model’s validation errors cannot be fully attributed, in a probabilistic sense, to lack of knowledge about the correct values of these 940 parameters. We highlight important omitted factors, such as the modelling of care homes and medical facilities, and the effect of using face masks, that could be the reason for this discrepancy.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 NHS planning is typically driven by a mix of historical data and trend analysis. COVID\-19 \(a 

 novel virus\), lacking such data, required rapid evidence analysis, synthesis, and simulation to 

 provide actionable local insight. Senior NHS managers \(CIOs and direct reports\) from West 

 London with Bell planned a collaboration strategy in March 2020. Brunel was then able to rapidly assemble academic teams deploying their research on evidence sifting \(for model inputs\), COVID\-19 transmission and bed utilisation modelling. Research outputs were subsequently disseminated to the NHS through the delivery, presentation and discussion of 15 written forecast reports between April and December 2020, directly feeding into operational planning decisions of 2 NHS trusts, the London North West University Healthcare \(LNWH\) Trust and the Hillingdon Hospitals \(HH\) Trust, which together are responsible for the healthcare provision for 1,290,000 citizens. Scenarios were co\-designed with the NHS as research was developed and validated. Forecasts were then disseminated to NHS analytics groups to further support short\-term, elective and social care planning and transformation. 

 The epidemiological simulation toolkit has been used repeatedly from early in the first wave of 

 the pandemic **\[E8 and E9\]** to provide long term forecasts of COVID\-19 spread to LNWH, and 

 was used during the second wave and after to provide forecasts for HH. This supported 

 healthcare delivery across West London in three different ways: 

 First, it informed the trusts’ operational response during subsequent waves of the pandemic 

 **\[E1\]**, which led to LNWH arranging capacity in advance that benefited approximately 4,000 

 COVID\-19 hospital patients during this period **\[E3\]**. Planning the zoning and repurposing of 

 wards was undertaken using a range of forecasted scenarios which included key decision or 

 trigger points. This was required as patient admission ranged from several per day to 

 approximately 1 per 10 minutes. As the pandemic progressed, models were refined and 

 adapted to better support general and acute \(G&A\) and intensive care unit \(ICU\) bed planning 

 \(including surge capacity and stand\-down points\). This enabled the flexing of bed capacity 

 throughout 2020 from no COVID\-19 beds up to 54 additional ICU beds and 44 acute respiratory 

 beds. The capacity increase also was aligned with the wider planning with local councils, such 

 that sufficient care home support and intermediate recovery beds were prepared for the surge 

 capacity scenario. 

 Second, it influenced the assumptions underlying the scenarios the trusts developed to help 

 them plan their non\-COVID elective service recovery **\[E1\]**. Brunel’s forecasts provided early 

 warnings for new peaks which subsequently occurred, and quieter periods that occurred in 

 between. Both COVID\-19 and elective service recovery planning affects the work pressure level 

 and well\-being of approximately 2,600 relevant hospital staff \(healthcare assistants plus 

 medical\) and affects the care provisioning for approximately 1,600 elective inpatient and day 

 case admissions per week **\[E4\]**. In addition, the research helped LNWH to understand the 

 potential interplay of different factors in driving COVID19 admissions demand variations **\[E1\]**. 

 Third, forecasts indicated the scale and pace at which capacity needs to be expanded and 

 whether it can be returned towards other health and care needs **\[E1\]**. The preparatory efforts, 

 informed by Brunel’s research, of both NHS trusts enabled them to facilitate more COVID\-19 

 patients in their hospitals \(629 beds occupied\) during the peak of the third wave as compared to 

 the peak of the first wave \(268 beds occupied\) **\[E3\]**. 

 The Brunel team was also requested by the Rapid Assistance In Modelling the Pandemic 

 \(RAMP\) initiative, which is coordinated by the Royal Society, to analyse the sensitivities and 

 limitations of the CovidSim code **\[REF5\]** using the VECMA sensitivity analysis and ensemble 

 simulation toolkit **\[REF6\]**. The results from Arabnejad, Groen, and others in the VECMA consortium were fed back to RAMP in a report **\[E7\]** and contributed towards a shift in SAGE away from sole reliance on the CovidSim model **\[E10\]**. The results are also published on the Science Museum web page for educational purposes to the general public **\[E6\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Cain’s award\-winning research has demonstrated the importance of including three discourse\-level skills that support successful reading comprehension \(inference and integration, knowledge and use of text structure, and comprehension monitoring\) in early reading instruction. This work has: 

 1\) improved reading instruction in England by underpinning policy changes that require reading comprehension to be taught; since 2014, these policies impact more than 4 million children in the UK each year and have resulted in revisions to national assessments. 

 2\) informed directly successful school\-, classroom\- and child\-level training programmes in the UK and Americas to improve reading comprehension, reaching 6,000 school leadership teams and more than 14,000 trained users, globally. Separate programmes of eBooks and digital reading support have reached more than 250,000 children worldwide. 

 3\) enriched the awareness and understanding of the skills required for good reading comprehension of more than 20,000 education and healthcare professionals globally. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Approximately 10% of children globally have reading comprehension skills that are significantly behind their word reading ability and those of other same\-age children, impacting their educational success and also their future employment options, income, and health outcomes. The World Literacy Foundation estimates the cost of illiteracy to the UK economy at £81 billion per year. Improving literacy skills in the school years is a key step to breaking a family’s cycle of poverty and disadvantage. 

 Cain’s research has elucidated the relations between core discourse\-level language skills and reading comprehension development and difficulties. Traditionally, early reading instruction focused on recognising and pronouncing written words; the language skills that support reading comprehension were not a focus of instruction. 

 Cain has published more than 70 papers since her appointment at Lancaster in 2005. This body of work provides a more detailed and precise understanding of the skills that support the development of reading comprehension and why some children have substantial difficulties with reading comprehension, despite developing age\-appropriate word reading skills. 

 Successful reading comprehension involves the construction of a meaning\-based mental representation of the situation described by the text. To construct this mental representation, readers draw on lexical\-, sentence\-, and discourse\-level language skills. Notably, Cain’s work has identified the importance of three discourse\-level language predictors of reading comprehension, namely: inference and integration skills \(the ability to make links between sections of text and prior knowledge\); knowledge and use of text structure \(to establish causal and temporal event sequences and identify main themes\); and comprehension monitoring \(knowing how to check understanding and rectify problems\). 

 Cain’s work has shown that, beyond the general contributions of word reading, vocabulary and grammar, these three discourse\-level language skills are unique predictors of reading comprehension \(3.1\). Her work has provided novel evidence that these skills directly affect the development of reading comprehension during the primary school years and are not simply by\-products of good comprehension. Four strands of evidence demonstrate the specific importance of these discourse\-level skills: 

 1\) The skills are weak in 8\- to 10\-year\-olds with reading comprehension difficulties: when compared with peers at the same level of word reading and vocabulary, children with poor reading comprehension \(assessed with a standardised assessment\) have weaker inference, text structure, and comprehension monitoring skills \(3.1, 3.2\); 

 2\) Performance on these discourse\-level skills predicts long\-term reading comprehension outcomes between 4 and 11 years of age, after controlling for initial comprehension ability \(3.3, 3.4\); 

 3\) Developmental comparisons \(7\-year\-olds through to adults\) indicate that these skills explain age\-related improvements in general measures of reading comprehension \(3.5\); and 

 4\) When targeted in training programmes, growth in these skills for 7\- to 10\-year\-olds results in improved reading comprehension on standardised assessments \(3.6\). 

 This body of work provides robust evidence that these language skills should be included in the literacy curriculum to support reading comprehension development in general, and that they should be targeted in interventions to develop reading comprehension and remediate specific reading comprehension difficulties. The results of such inclusion are described in the Impacts section below.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Three impacts of Cain’s work are described: \(1\) UK policy changes and resultant change in teacher practice and national assessments; \(2\) the development of successful interventions to improve reading comprehension; and \(3\) enriched understanding of the skills required for good reading comprehension for professionals, globally. 

###  1\) UK policy changes that influenced teacher practice and national assessments and improved reading instruction. 

 Cain was approached by the Department for Education during the last REF period to consult on the Programme of Study for English for the new National Curriculum, which was subsequently launched in September 2014. 

 Cain’s research underpinned changes made from the previous National Curriculum, which was in place from 2000, resulting in the inclusion of the three core discourse\-level language skills \( **inference and integration skills**, **knowledge and use of text structure** and **comprehension monitoring** \(5.1\)\). Cain’s contribution during the consultation was to identify specific details and additional skills that were missing from the draft and to further specify what counts as progression in reading development from Year 1 to Year 6 \(5.2, 5.3\). *“Your contributions to the meetings at the DfE and your detailed, research\-led commentary on the various drafts of the curriculum helped to improve substantially the sections on comprehension; these improvements are evident in the published framework.”* \(5.3, Contracted Drafter for National Curriculum\). 

 The impact includes **a change to reading instruction that impacts more than 4 million children each year in all local authority maintained schools in England** \(68% of English primary schools \(5.1\), who were required by law to teach this programme of study from September 2014 \(5.1\)\). Specifically, UK educational policy and the resultant practice now incorporate a greater emphasis on the teaching of reading comprehension and the three core skills that Cain’s work has shown to support reading comprehension \(5.1\). To date, approximately 6.7 million unique children from 5 to 12 years have benefitted from an enriched opportunity to develop successful reading comprehension skills. 

 In addition, the revised National Curriculum \(2014\) led to changes in the Standard Assessment Tests \(SATs\) papers taken by every child in England \(excluding academy and free schools\) at the end of Key Stages 1 & 2. SATs now include the assessment of the key areas identified by Cain’s research: assessing the ability to “ *make inferences from the text”,* using text structure to *“explain how narrative content is related and contributes to meaning as a whole”,* and comprehension monitoring by making *“comparisons within the text”* \(5.1\). The percentage of children reaching the expected level of performance or above at the end of Key Stage 2 rose from 66% in 2016 to 73% in 2019 \(5.1\). Finally, the OFSTED inspection framework \(2019\) now considers the role of inference and monitoring in the teaching of comprehension and acknowledges Cain’s work \(5.1\). 

###  2\) Influencing the development of successful school\-, classroom\- and child\-level interventions and curriculum supplements to enhance reading comprehension. 

 Cain has directly supported the development of national and international interventions and curriculum supplements designed to improve reading comprehension skills in school children. 

 At the school level, nationally, Cain served as series editor on the UK\-based **Oxford Owl School Improvement Pathway for Teaching Comprehension** \(Oxford University Press, OUP\). Cain co\-wrote the research overview for teachers, drawing on her own work that identified the core components of successful reading comprehension, took part in videos to explain the research base, and helped to develop the template materials and texts. Since the launch in 2015 this has provided more than \[text removed for publication\] UK school leadership teams with the structure, research and resources to develop and monitor a whole\-school improvement plan targeting reading comprehension across all year groups \(5.4\). 

 At the classroom level, nationally, Cain’s work informed directly the **Inference Training Programme** \(published by Leicester City Council, November 2013 and developed by literacy advisor Whatmuff\) \(5.5\) and OUP’s **Project X Comprehension Express** \(5.5\). Inference Training has been accessed by over 2,000 UK schools with demonstrated efficacy: more than 12 months’ improvement on standardised tests of reading comprehension after 12 weeks of intervention \(5.5, 5.6\). Internationally, the significance of Cain’s work was noted by educational psychologists at the Universidad Nacional de San Martín, Buenos Aires, Argentina; they drew heavily on Cain’s research to justify inclusion of the three discourse\-level skills in two Spanish\-language classroom\-based reading comprehension programmes that they developed and designed. This is evidenced in the theoretical manuals that accompany the programmes \(5.7\). **LEE Comprensivamente,** designed for 8\-year\-olds, has around 7,300 trained users \(educational psychologists and teachers\) in Argentina and other Spanish\-speaking countries \(e.g., Uruguay\) since 2014. **Para Leerte Mejor \(PLM\) Programme** \(published 2016\), targeted at 6\- to 8\-year\-olds, has around 6,500 trained users to date \(5.7\). Nearly 26,000 copies of the materials for children have been purchased, to date \(5.7\). In Argentina, these classroom\-based programmes have led to significant improvements in the target skills and, critically, scores on a standardised measure of reading comprehension compared with non\-intervention schools, regardless of socio\-economic status \(5.7\). Cain’s work is highly cited in a report about the Teachers \[sic\] College globally reaching Reading and Writing curriculum; the report judged to be one of the 10 most influential reports in education in 2020 influenced the curriculum author’s intention to change the focus of the programme \(5.8\). Finally, Cain’s work influenced directly **The Reading Comprehension Blueprint** \(Hennessy, 2020\), a theoretical and practical manual for literacy instructors, and related comprehension professional development course for educators, which has now reached more than 3,000 literacy specialists \(5.9\). 

 At the child level, Cain’s research has informed directly the development of two digital literacy supplements. Cain worked with OUP to develop **Oxford Reading Buddy**, a programme of eBooks with a virtual tutor to support deeper comprehension, and quizzes to provide feedback to teachers. According to OUP’s Reading Buddy website, it *“has been devised to represent the best research in the area of comprehension whilst also reflecting statutory assessment criteria and ease of use for teachers and students”* \(5.4\). Launched in summer 2019, Oxford Reading Buddy has changed the literacy experience of children in over \[text removed for publication\] schools globally \(5.4\). Cain’s research has been used to support the inclusion of specific comprehension skills, and the design of the activities to teach those skills, in another digital reading supplement developed by the US\-based company **Amplify** \(5.10\). Amplify Reading has been adopted by nearly 2,000 elementary schools, reaching approximately 250,000 children in the US from kindergarten through to Grade 5. Usage of the programme for just a single semester resulted in significant improvements on a standardised reading assessment, with students showing average gains of 100 compared with 57.6 points for students in the national database group \(who did not receive the Amplify supplement\) \(5.10\). 

###  3\) National and international engagement that has enriched professionals’ awareness and understanding of the skills required for good reading comprehension. 

 The UK National Curriculum focuses on what skills should be taught, but not why or how. Cain’s engagement work has directly addressed this gap. Cain co\-authored a book entitled *‘ **Understanding and Teaching Reading Comprehension’** targeted at increasing teachers’ understanding and awareness of the importance of reading comprehension and how to apply this knowledge in the classroom \(Oakhill, Cain, and Elbro, 2015\). The book summarises Cain’s research, and that of others, and includes practical exercises to demonstrate the comprehension challenges faced by developing readers and poor comprehenders, and recommendations for how to apply this knowledge in the classroom to foster core comprehension skills. The book has sold more than 6,000 copies in the UK to date \(5.11\). It has been published in Danish \(4,000\+ sales\), and licenced for Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, and Italian, each with language\-specific changes. The book has been widely praised by teachers and other education professionals. A professor at the State University of New York at Cortland wrote, *“These three authors have been leaders in the field of reading comprehension research for decades. This volume provides the fruits of those efforts in an easy\-to\-read fashion. It should be read by all those who teach our children to read”* \(5.11\). 

 Effective remediation of poor comprehension requires that education and healthcare professionals are aware of its incidence and potential causes to enable early identification and targeted remediation. Cain has addressed this through extensive national and international engagement with teachers, teacher educators, and speech and language therapists including keynotes at practitioner conferences, bespoke workshops, and live webinars directly reaching at least 20,000 professionals, including members of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the British Dyslexia Association, and the International Dyslexia Association, and her work on the research advisory panel of AIM academy in the U.S., a school for children with language\-based learning difficulties \(5.9\). The impacts of Cain’s engagement about her research are evident from recommendations in resources and good practice for schools and language therapy within and beyond the UK \(5.9; 5.11\). 

 The impacts of Cain’s research were recognised in the 2016 Samuel Torrey Orton Award, the highest honour awarded by the International Dyslexia Association, that recognises a person who has *“made a vital contribution to our scientific understanding of dyslexia”* through work that has *“significantly enhanced and advanced our capacity to successfully intervene and assist people with dyslexia”* and *“expanded national and international awareness of dyslexia’*” \(5.9\). Cain was also recognised as runner\-up \(joint with Oakhill\) for the 2014 ESRC Outstanding Impact in Society Award, an annual award “to recognise and reward ESRC\-supported researchers who've created or enabled outstanding impact from social science research.” \(5.12\).

##  1. Summary of the impact 

 Global maritime safety has been influenced by a range of collaborative research projects led by researchers in Naval Architecture Ocean and Marine Engineering at Strathclyde. Key findings were applied directly in the regulation\-making process in the International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\) from January 2014 onwards; these regulations affect all commercial shipping operating up to December 2019, with important amendments informed by Strathclyde research introduced from January 2020. IMO regulations ensure a safety level is maintained, using a ‘risk\-based’ approach to foster innovation in design and operation of over 12,000 commercial vessels since August 2013. IMO regulations have directly led to reduction in loss of and damage to ships, reduction in injuries and loss of lives at sea, and supported economic benefits to the global maritime and insurance sectors. 
","
##  2. Underpinning research 

 The International Maritime Organisation \(IMO\) is the United Nations agency responsible for safety, security and pollution prevention in international shipping and promotes standards, which influence the whole life cycle of maritime assets. These standards are in the form of International Conventions, such as the Safety of Life at Sea \(SOLAS\) regulations, which govern the design and operation of the merchant fleet with around 60,000 large merchant vessels \(over 500 gross tonnes\) transporting around 11 billion tons of goods and millions of crew and passengers around the world each year. Since 2000, a sustained programme of research involving six key academics noted above and over 50 other researchers in Naval Architecture Ocean and Marine Engineering at the University of Strathclyde has directly influenced the content and nature of SOLAS regulations, and hence the safety culture in the maritime industry. Key contributions to maritime safety are based on a significant body of research including: 

 **Introduction of the ‘Design for Safety’ approach**, leading to a paradigm shift in maritime safety regulations. This body of research established safety as a quantifiable design objective, using the principle of Goal Based Standards \(GBS\) to identify/quantify risks and achieve safety goals, as opposed to safety achieved by rule compliance. Over the past 20 years, the pace of technological development in the maritime industry led to unprecedented changes and safety challenges that could only be met by risk\-based approaches, rather than frequent prescriptive rule changes. In 2000 Strathclyde researchers instigated and established a large\-scale EU Thematic Network in maritime safety to promote the ‘design for safety’ philosophy, to implement Risk\-Based Design in industry and then to develop and take this risk\-centric regulatory framework to IMO \[ **R1**\]. 

 Vassalos and his research group proposed a methodological treatment of the dynamics of damaged ships while addressing the ensuing risk of flooding and offering solutions to the industry \[ **R4**\]. They developed and introduced techniques to measure safety and assess the performance of ships following incidents such as collision and grounding, leading to large scale flooding. The methodology enabled causal chains of events to be studied systematically to understand what happened, when, how and why, leading to better\-informed prevention, mitigation and control strategies and measures. A substantial body of research over 20 years examined target risk contributors and barriers, which included intact stability \[ **R3**\], damage stability \[ **R4**\], fire \[ **R1**\], efficiency in ship systems through energy flows \[ **R2**\], passenger evacuation \[ **R3**\], health monitoring of marine systems and structures \[ **R5**\], quantification of the human factors contribution to maritime safety, safety culture and awareness \[ **R6**\], risk analysis and assessment tools \[ **R1**, **R4**\]. The development of scientific first\-principles tools such as software, databases, and frameworks, allowed maritime safety to be assessed directly and quantitatively for the first time. 

 **Life cycle risk management:** In the maritime industry, new regulations apply only to ships laying keel after a given regulation has been enforced. This can leave 90% of the existing fleet operating at inferior standards, compared to new designs. Addressing this gap, several EU\-funded H2020 projects led by Strathclyde \(2019\-2022\), e.g. FLARE, SAFEPASS, AUTOSHIP, have involved key industry stakeholders to develop the requisite tools and, through IMO, an unprecedented regulatory framework for life cycle risk management, to address safety of all new and existing ships with any available cost\-effective means \[ **R4**\]. With the development of software and modelling tools, researchers at Strathclyde have enlarged the platform of cost\-effective solutions for life cycle risk management, for example by addressing environmental risk and energy efficiency over the lifespan of the vessel, to encompass design, operation and retrofitting \[ **R2**\]. Innovative measures linked to human factors, outcomes of the SAFEMODE project \(2019\-2022\), have been applied to maritime safety. Similarly, the EU FP7 SEAHORSE project \(2013\-2016\), led by Turan, addressed human and organisational errors in maritime accidents, for example through transfer of well\-proven practices and methodologies from air transport to marine transport \[ **R6**\].

##  4. Details of the impact 

 Through sustained collaboration with the IMO and the maritime industry, both during the research process and in disseminating the research outcomes, Strathclyde researchers have contributed to significant improvements to maritime safety and innovative legislation and practice. In particular, the researchers’ participation in IMO Working Groups \(for the original SOLAS 2009 regulations and bi\-annual amendments from January 2014 onwards\) and their promotion of collaborative working in the maritime industry through Centres of Excellence \(including the Maritime Safety Research Centre, Maritime Human Factors Centre, and Safety and Risk Doctoral Training Centre\) have been key drivers in these changes. The researchers also established University spin\-out companies, Safety at Sea Ltd \(1999\-2014\) and Maritime Safety Innovations Ltd \(2017\-present\), with maritime industry leaders to provide consultancy and training, and promote innovative safety solutions with emphasis on life cycle risk management. They have organised and participated in international industry\-academia conferences and workshops to transfer knowledge from the research. In this way, the following demonstrable impacts have been achieved: 

###  Informing legislation adopted by and promoted through the IMO 

 The IMO’s rules are the most important international instrument addressing maritime safety in the global merchant fleet, covering areas such as ship design, construction and equipment, subdivision and stability, fire protection, radio\-communications, safety of navigation, carriage of cargoes \(including dangerous cargoes\), safety management and maritime security. The merchant fleet also includes all passenger ships \(carrying more than 12 passengers\) on international voyages, with millions of passengers travelling on such ships each year. 

 Vassalos and Boulougouris have provided expertise and input from research projects to various regulatory working groups through the UK Government delegation to IMO, \(including Formal Safety Assessment Group, Environmental Impact Group and Safety of Domestic Ferries Group\) \[ **S1**\]. They have influenced bi\-annual amendments to the SOLAS 2009 regulations, which were in force until December 2019, and a series of important amendments introduced from January 2020. The Director of IMO’s Maritime Safety Division confirms that: ‘Strathclyde\-led projects … provided the inspiration and supported the development of several maritime safety\-defining initiatives that paved the way to complete modernisation of maritime safety. Noteworthy are also a number of technical presentations at IMO by Strathclyde to nurture wider understanding and support a fast\-pacing regulation process over the recent past’ \[ **S1**\]. 

 Principal to these contributions is the introduction of the ‘design for safety’ approach, based on the Strathclyde research, which led to the adoption of goal\-based standards \(GBS\) within all SOLAS regulations. The importance of this approach is confirmed on the IMO website: ‘IMO Member Governments have started approaching safety from a completely new perspective – one that is goal and performance oriented, in lieu of the traditional prescriptive\-based approach, taking into account the sophisticated nature of the maritime industry’ \[ **S2a**\]. The GBS approach continues to influence the regulation process of the IMO. The latest IMO instruments using the GBS approach to monitoring safety are the Polar Code \(which came into force from January 2017\), the International Code of Safety for Ships Using Gases or Other Low\-flashpoint Fuels \(IGF Code; adopted June 2015\), and ship construction standards for bulk carriers and oil tankers of 150m in length and above \(adopted in 2012, came into force for vessels with a building contract placed on or after 1st July 2016\) \[ **S2a**\]. 

 Amendments to SOLAS regulations on subdivision and damage stability were adopted from June 2015, to update rules for international cargo and passenger ships \[ **S2b**\]. Damage stability failure represents 90% of the risk to human lives in maritime accidents, and as a ship is subdivided into compartments, it must be able to withstand flooding in one or more compartments without sinking. Revisions were based on findings from Strathclyde led EU funded collaborations, such as GOALDS \(Goal Based Damage Stability\) and FLOODSTAND \(Integrated Flooding Control and Standard for Stability and Crises Management\) \[ **S1**\]. 

 Further amendments on damage stability regulations came into effect in January 2020, relating to subdivision of passenger ships \[ **S2b**\]. IMO’s involvement in regulation of domestic ferry safety began with the Manila Conference in the Philippines in 2015, based on the work undertaken by Strathclyde and World Maritime University, Sweden, with Vassalos acting as lead consultant on behalf of IMO \[ **S1**, **S2c**\]. This led to the adoption of the ‘Manila Statement’, which acknowledged the urgent need to enhance the safety of domestic ferries and urged States to review and update national regulations in relation to their passenger ferries \[ **S2c**\]. While domestic ferry operations are not required to comply with SOLAS, the IMO notes that now ‘many countries base their regulations on the IMO standards’ and the IMO has issued a set of standards comprising regulations and model national legislation applicable to non\-SOLAS ships \[ **S2c**\]. 

###  Embedding a safety culture in maritime industry 

 The adoption of the ‘design for safety’ approach and subsequent changes to the regulatory process has overcome previous resistance to safety improvements in the industry, as the regulations are no longer saturated with risk\-control. Maritime safety was once treated as a costly, damage limiting exercise, with design changes and safety regulation made in response to disasters at sea such as the sinking of the Estonia in 1994 when 852 people died. The risk\-based approach to ship design enabled regulators such as IMO to set the right level of safety, designers to plan for requisite safety margins and ship owners to manage impending risks, all parties achieving this cost\-effectively. The Director \(2001–2016\) of the Directorate for Mobility and Transport \(European Commission\) confirms that ‘ *Strathclyde have more often than not acted in a co\-ordinator role in many maritime safety initiatives*’ and this research has ‘ *defined the evolution and direction of maritime safety*’ \[ **S3**\]. Similarly, the Senior Vice President DNV GL, a Classification Society which offers knowledge\-based services to ship owners, shipyards, system suppliers and other stakeholders in the maritime industry, comments that ‘one of the key developments in these \[Strathclyde\] projects was methods, tools and data leading to estimation of the safety level of ships, a distinct revolutionary change in maritime safety … that has helped transform both the evolution of safety as well as the focus, opening the door to innovation and facilitating technological breakthroughs’ \[ **S4**\]. 

###  Supporting innovation in ship design and operation 

 All new merchant ships built worldwide must comply with SOLAS 2009 regulations and all subsequent amendments. The European Maritime Safety Agency \(EMSA\) reports that in 2018 there were 12,048 ‘new’ merchant ships in the global fleet between 0 and 4 years of age, ranging from cargo and container ships, bulk carriers, oil, chemical and gas tankers, passenger ships and fishing vessels \[ **S5**\] all designed and then constructed under SOLAS regulations. 

 Safety assessment at the design stage affects the maritime industry in many ways apart from safety of operation. It provides safety assurance for novel concepts, fostering and supporting innovative designs such as megaships and battery\-driven ships. It has facilitated the introduction and growth of innovations such as digital and autonomous ships, and enabled integration of novel concepts in ship design, such as safety centres and developments in life\-saving equipment. 

 The Head of Engineering at Meyerwerft, one of the most innovative shipyards in the world, comments that he promotes ‘the full positive impact of these advances in ship design, particularly the design for safety, among the industry’ and confirms the now industry\-wide application of Strathclyde research to assess safety at the design stage, in particular ‘advanced simulation tools addressing damage stability and risk of flooding in daily design of passenger ships’ \[ **S6**\]. 

 The new Royal Caribbean Cruise Line \(RCCL\) Icon megaships currently under construction can accommodate 10,500 people on board. They are described as the ultimate lifeboat, demonstrating through direct assessment that the ship can survive any realisable flooding accident scenario. The Executive Vice President of RCCL highlighted that the ‘new holistic approaches to safety, inspired by Strathclyde, are enabling us to raise the safety bar in all our ships with ingenious ways never thought possible before .... mega ships are a product of partnerships .. with Strathclyde as strategic partner’ \[ **S7**\]. The RCCL website notes that ‘All of our ships are designed and operated in compliance with the strict requirements of the International Maritime Organization, the UN agency that sets global standards for the safety and operation of cruise ships, codified in the Safety of Life at Sea \(SOLAS\) Convention. Safety\-related regulations are rigorous – and we often go above and beyond what is required; for example, carrying backup mechanical, navigational and safety provisions’ \[ **S8**\]. 

###  Reduction in loss of vessels, life and injuries at sea 

 The Allianz Review of Global Shipping \(2019\) reports annual total loss of vessels over 100GT has fallen substantially from 207 reported in 2000 to only 46 vessels in 2018 \[ **S9**\]. The review confirms that annual losses are now at their lowest level this century, and since 2009, when SOLAS regulations first came into force, shipping losses have declined by 65%. The Allianz report highlights that ‘improved ship design and technology, stepped\-up regulation and advances in risk management and safety are driving the sector’s long term loss improvement. More robust safety management systems and procedures on vessels is also a factor in preventing breakdowns, accidents and other mistakes from escalating into total losses’. \[ **S9**\] 

 Passenger safety in the European shipping sector has also improved. The European Maritime Safety Agency \(EMSA\) recorded a 57% drop in the number of fatalities between 2014 and 2019 from 114 to 49, and a 26% reduction in injuries to passengers and crew from 1239 to 917 over the same period \(data based on statistics gathered from the accident investigation bodies of the EU\) \[ **S5**\]. The Director of the Directorate General for Mobility and Transport \(European Commission\) confirms that with support from Strathclyde research the ‘development of regulations for passenger ships has helped the European Community to take a leading position in the process and .. help crystallise probabilistic regulations with emphasis on passenger ships, leading over the years to sustained improvement in maritime safety and a continuing downturn in loss of life at sea’ \[ **S3**\]. 

###  Economic benefits to global maritime and UK insurance sectors 

 The continued safe operation of commercial shipping is essential for the economic success of the global maritime sector. By 2019, the total value of the annual world shipping trade had reached more than 14 trillion US Dollars \(International Chamber of Shipping data\). The Director of Safety at DNV GL states that ‘through collaboration with Strathclyde we have developed a series of unique scientific methods and tools… to enhance our service offerings to the satisfaction of our customers, adding value to the whole maritime value chain’ \[ **S4**\]. Reductions in losses reduce claims on and economic loss to the insurance sector. This is particularly significant for the UK, which has a 35% share of global marine insurance premiums, 60% of protection and indemnity insurance and 26% of total global shipbroking. Analysis by Allianz Global of 230,000 marine insurance industry claims, with a value of almost USD10,000,000,000 \(07\-2018\), between July 2013 and July 2018 \[ **S9**\] shows that ship sinking/collision incidents are the most expensive cause of loss for insurers, accounting for 15% of the value of all claims – equivalent to more than USD1,500,000,000 \(07\-2018\) over this period. 

 Improvements in maritime safety \- stemming from regulations informed by Strathclyde\-led research and tools developed by Strathclyde to support ship design and operation practices – have resulted in fewer vessels lost and fewer fatalities, representing a significant benefit to the global economy and to the safety of passengers and crew.

It increased awareness and appreciation of an overlooked working\-class writer, recovering forgotten works, facilitating their republication by a publisher with national and international distribution networks, and enhancing access to seldom\-viewed regional films. It introduced collaborative research practices into schools, contributing to teachers’ professional development and raising young people’s aspirations and engagement by unlocking creativity and developing research skills. It facilitated new cultural artefacts, generating new ways of representing the north and informing artists’ continuing practice, and enriched the Hines archive through the co\-production and deposit of new material.

 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The research illuminates the significance of the novelist, dramatist, and screenwriter Barry Hines \(1939\-2016\), whose work includes the novel *A Kestrel for a Knave* \(1968\), filmed as *Kes* \(1969\), and the TV drama *Threads* \(1984\). 

 In 2008, Vice – then working on Hines’ near\-contemporary and fellow screenwriter Jack Rosenthal – was shown Hines’ papers, stored in boxes in his attic. Recognising their value, she negotiated their donation to Special Collections, University of Sheffield. This ensured the preservation of, and wider access to, this unique archive, which includes Hines’ correspondence, research materials, and scripts of otherwise ‘lost’ plays: ones which were either never performed, or recordings of which were subsequently destroyed. As such, the archive offers unparalleled insight into Hines’ practice as a writer and collaborator, and provides an eye\-witness perspective on the socio\-political culture of the North of England during a time of de\-industrialisation. The research subsequently conducted by Vice and Forrest – currently comprising the first book\-length study of Hines’ work \(R1\), one article \(R2\), and four essays \(R3\-6\) – is based on this archive. Key findings include: 

1.  Hines was a meticulous nature writer, and was much more involved in establishing the visual elements of his screenwork than has previously been understood, particularly in relation to the depiction of landscape and urban architecture. This reinstates Hines as a crucial creative presence in the filming of his work; it also challenges the critically dominant idea of auteurism, whereby a filmmaker controls all elements of production, resulting in a recognisable directorial style. Hines’ working relationships with directors and producers such as Ken Loach and Tony Garnett were symbiotic rather than hierarchical. Acknowledging this restores the often overlooked position of screenwriters, particularly working\-class screenwriters \(like Hines\), within film authorship. 

1.  Recovering Hines’ ‘lost’ works – such as *Billy’s Last Stand* \(1965\), the tapes of which were destroyed by the BBC – shows that he was much more experimental than his frequent association with ‘kitchen sink realism’ suggests. Initially produced as a radio play for the BBC, it was subsequently performed at London’s Royal Court Upstairs \(a space renowned for ambitious, cutting\-edge theatre\). Paying attention to the full breadth of Hines’ oeuvre contests reductive ideas of working\-class writing as generically limited, building a much richer picture of what it meant to be a working\-class writer in the second half of the twentieth century. 

1.  Hines’ role as a documenter of the political history of northern England has only been partially understood because of the suppression of his output in the final decades of his career. Hines was a first\-hand witness to the 1984\-5 miners’ strike and its aftermath. Scripts of three unproduced plays – *After the Strike* \(1985\), *The Diggers* \(1994\), *Follow the Sun* \(2003\) – and correspondence about them reveal the part played by British broadcasters \(BBC, Channel 4\) in occluding ideologically sensitive material about the strike. The research also shows how Hines struggled to articulate in artistic form the social, cultural, and economic trauma of de\-industrialisation, and helps explain the sudden stalling of his career after the high point of *Threads*.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Forrest and Vice <ins>rehabilitated Hines’ reputation</ins>, using co\-creative practices and varied forms \(oral, written, visual\) to engage diverse audiences. Their championing of Hines led directly to the publisher *And Other Stories* acquiring the rights in 2020 to **publish Hines’ unpublished and out\-of\-print works**, making those available to national and international readerships: without them “ *none of this would have happened*” \[S1\]. 

 The research on Hines underpinned BBC4’s **documentary** *Looking for Kes* \(2019; with total viewing figures of 545,000, it was the channel’s ninth most watched programme in the week that it first aired \[S2\]\). The public interest this inspired is evidenced by the spike in pageviews of Hines’ Wikipedia entry \(23,000\+ post\-screening\), the revision of which Forrest supervised \[S3\]. The research also informed **journalistic work** on Cold War nuclear cultures and sports writing \[S4\]. In particular, the football magazine *When Saturday Comes* \(average monthly circulation, 14,500; online users 210,000\) brought Hines to a different twenty\-first century audience. 

 Showcasing working\-class writing and expressing working\-class experience is crucial owing to the long\-term exclusion of people of working\-class origins from the creative industries \(‘ [<ins>Panic\!</ins>](https://createlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panic-Social-Class-Taste-and-Inequalities-in-the-Creative-Industries1.pdf)’ report, 2018\). Forrest co\-curated two **exhibitions** about Hines’ work with artists Murphy and Want \(2018, 2019\) and delivered over fifteen **public talks** across the UK \(August 2013\-July 2020\), reaching more diverse audiences than such events usually attract, including some of Sheffield’s most deprived postcodes \[S3\]. These activities transformed how people viewed Hines’ work and subject matter, building his audience and fostering interest in working\-class art more widely. Representative comments: *“I found myself looking at the landscape in a way I just wouldn’t have noticed otherwise*”; “ *I’ve had an awakening with art… I’m excited to explore more social realist work*” \[S3\]. 

 Forrest collaborated with Dearne Valley Landscape Partnership, placing Hines at the centre of Heritage Lottery funded **arts and community engagement** regenerating an area devastated by deindustrialisation. A reading group \(2016\) engaged local residents – including ‘reluctant’ adult readers – with Hines’ work and archive. This group co\-produced a **short film**, *Cushion of Mist*, exploring Hines’ evocations of landscape and how his work influenced their understanding of place and belonging \[S5\]. The film was screened in Sheffield \(2017, 2018\) and is available via vimeo \(300\+ plays\). These screenings impacted positively on audience members’ sense of self and well\-being. Representative comments: “ *I felt more connected to my roots and social history*”; “ *the film made me think I should walk in nature more*” \[S3\]. 

 These public\-facing activities generated new collaborations, including the **first public performance** of *After the Strike*, co\-produced with Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign \(2019\), and produced **new material for the archive**, including responses to Hines’ work \(valuable records of reader engagement\) and biographical testimonials. For example, miners who drove Hines while he chronicled the strike approached Forrest after a talk and subsequently provided important information which would otherwise have been lost. 

 Enhancing access to regional films 

 Forrest and Vice curated ‘South Yorkshire Trilogy’ \(Showroom, Sheffield, 2018\), featuring three of Hines’ films, alongside talks and an exhibition, for Film Hub North’s ‘Our North’ season. Screenings were sold out \(350\+ tickets\), **reaching multi\-generational audiences** and **generating income** for an independent cinema during the summer \(usually problematically quiet\) \[S6\]. Increasing access to, and interest in, specialist films is particularly significant in Yorkshire and Humber, which has only  [<ins>7.2% of UK’s specialist cinemas</ins>](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-statistical-yearbook-2014.pdf) \(strikingly few, considering the region’s size and population\). The trilogy contributed to the Showroom’s mission to build audiences: its programmer \(Pettersson\) observes that, as a working\-class writer, Hines was especially effective at overcoming socio\-cultural barriers to accessing arts venues \[S6\]. 

 The trilogy’s success **influenced the Showroom’s practice**, demonstrating demand for local stories and giving Pettersson confidence to ‘push back’ when Film Hub North proposed changing the remit of their 2019 season. The interest in the accompanying exhibition also encouraged Pettersson to feature other archives when programming special seasons \[S6\]. 

 Educational impact 

 Forrest’s work with schools focused on *Kestrel for a Knave*. Participants included the University’s post\-16 engagement programme \(2016\), Ecclesfield School \(2015, 2017\), Trinity Academy \(2018\), and Hinde House \(autumn 2013\), based in an economically deprived area of Sheffield \(50%\+ of pupils eligible for free school meals, twice the national average \[S7\]\). Feedback shows the experience **raised aspirations** and **increased pupil engagement**: 95% of Hinde House pupils reported being ‘more interested’ in schoolwork afterwards \[S7\]. 

 Brennan \(teacher, Hinde House; subsequently, Ecclesfield\) found the project transformational for three cohorts of 12\-year\-olds: it gave them “ *intellectual freedom to explore things in their own terms*”, improving the quality of their work, “ *which was more academic than I had seen before*”. The experience also **transformed** Brennan’s **teaching**, demonstrating the value of non\-essay\-based assessments and overturning her assumption that pupils only relate to recent texts. Brennan adopted the project’s methodology of treating pupils as ‘experts in the room’ and developed more collaborative methods of working with them: “ *it’s opened up a lot of doors to me as a teacher which would otherwise have remained closed”*, including inspiring her to work with other academics on a creative\-writing project \(Sheffield Hallam\) and ‘Classics for All’ \(Oxford\) \[S8\]. 

 Artistic impact 

 Making *Cushion of Mist* influenced film\-maker Brown’s creative practice, highlighting the **value of co\-production** and **facilitating more fluid approaches to narrative**, utilised in Brown’s subsequent heritage films \[S9\]. Collaboration with Forrest similarly enhanced Murphy’s and Want’s creative practice, stimulating both a **renewed commitment to working\-class art** and **specific artworks re\-evaluating childhood landscapes** \[S10\]. The collaboration also led to an **exhibition commission** – *Northern Town* \(Barnsley, 2020\) – tracing narratives of social change inspired by Hines’ charting of deindustrialisation.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Research on prison narratives and prisoner identity initiated an award\-winning partnership between the University’s English degree and the Scottish Prison Service \(an executive agency of the Scottish Government\), and Fife College \(the national prison education provider\), benefiting prisoners and university students through collaborative learning. The partnership enabled access to additional reading and writing activities for prisoners, enhancing their self\-esteem, while impacting students’ post\-graduation professional practice and their perceptions of prisoners. A second impact strand raised public understanding of prisoner identities and creativity in confinement, by engaging audiences through public events and media coverage on the BBC and in the national press. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Prisons are closed worlds, and few members of the public gain first\-hand insight into life behind prison walls. Public misconceptions about prisons and the incarcerated abound, compounded by reductive and dehumanizing misrepresentations in popular culture which also negatively impact on prisoners’ self\-perceptions and self\-esteem. Research conducted by Anne Schwan, at Edinburgh Napier since 2007 and now Professor in English, focuses on narratives about prisons and those inside to help demystify imprisonment, and to encourage a more complex understanding. The research also revealed restrictions on prisoner communication and limited access to reading and writing materials, in historical and contemporary contexts, as well as the benefits of creativity and reading and writing for prisoners. The latter remains vital in an underfunded prison system that continues to treat education as an add\-on rather than a core service during an incarcerated person’s journey. 

 Schwan’s original contributions to the interdisciplinary field of prison studies focus on historical and contemporary platforms for prisoners’ voices. Her AHRC\-funded **\[P1\]** monograph *Convict Voices* \(2014\) **\[O1\]**, based on textual and archival research \(involving ephemera in special collections at Oxford and Cambridge, and prison diaries and letters in the Women’s Library and the Museum of London\), identifies early accounts of female prisoners’ voices as significant precursors of later writings on imprisonment, to illuminate historical changes and continuities in prisoner self\-expression and educational opportunities for ex\-prisoners. The monograph analyses self\-representations of prisoners in nineteenth\-century street literature, novels and prison autobiographies, early twentieth\-century prison diaries and letters, and late twentieth\-century historical fiction. The insights into historical conditions in women’s prisons gained through this research were mapped onto the contemporary prison context to enhance prisoners’ experiences through additional access to reading and writing activities. 

 “*Bless the Gods for my pencils and paper*,” wrote imprisoned suffragette and artist Katie Gliddon in her secret diary in the margins of her illicit copy of the *Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley*, fearing that “ *If anyone discovers this book and pencil I shall die of sorrow*” \(2013\) \[ **O2\]** \(p. 153; funded archival research\) **\[P2\]**. While the research and impact work is mindful of historical and individual differences in the experience of imprisonment, recognition of this vital role of reading, writing and \(artistic\-creative\) self\-expression identified in Schwan’s research **\[O1, O2\]** serves as the foundation for the impact activities. By bringing historical contexts in conversation with contemporary concerns about prisoner self\-representation and penal conditions, the monograph evokes connections between prison scholarship, activism and practice to “ *use institutional leverage and resources to create opportunities for prisoners*” **\[O1, p. 198\]**. 

 Such connections between research and practice also motivate Schwan’s edited special issue with introduction \(2011\) **\[O3\]**, which presents reading and writing in prison as a space for radical pedagogy and transformation, “ *not only for those ‘inside’ but also those going into prisons as facilitators, be they creative practitioners, academics, or university students*” **\[O3, p. 1\]**. The special issue showcases the multi\-disciplinary study of prisoner autobiography, creative writing and reading practices, and partnerships between universities and penal institutions. 

 Research on *Stobsiade*, a camp newspaper produced by German internees at Stobs Camp in Scotland during the First World War, uncovers the function of creativity and humour for prisoners’ own identities and wider public perception. This first extensive analysis of the entire run of *Stobsiade*’s German\-language, military edition reveals how the internees negotiated censorship restrictions and re\-shaped perceptions of their PoW identity for external audiences and themselves \(2021\) **\[O4\]**. The research on war\-time internment – conducted during a Research Fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities \(IASH\) at the University of Edinburgh **\[P3\]** – and the research on imprisonment in historical and contemporary contexts, is conceptually linked by Schwan’s commitment to shedding light on socially marginalised experiences and identities, and a desire to generate new understanding of perspectives by and on the incarcerated. 

 The research has identified and enhanced the significance of a long\-standing literary and cultural tradition of giving voice to prisoners, and the ongoing struggle for access to reading and writing materials – a tradition which forms the historical basis for contemporary concerns with prisoner perspectives, creativity and access to literacy and learning in prisons.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Based on the research’s findings on the vital role of access to reading and writing in prison, and the transformational potential of university\-prison partnerships **\[O1, O2, O3\]**, Schwan first launched a placement scheme at HMP Edinburgh in 2011, involving English literature students in literacy and creative work with prisoners. The scheme has impacted on educational practice and benefitted participating prisoners through access to additional educational opportunities, leading to changed perspectives on themselves and others; university students benefitted through attitudinal changes, and effects on their post\-graduation professional practice. In a related, second impact strand, the research reached large audiences, leading to new awareness of prisoners’ voices, conditions and creativity in confinement, through public events and media engagement. 

 **Benefits to Prisoners and Students** 

 Following a successful pilot at HMP Edinburgh in 2011, a revised, legally robust partnership agreement was implemented in 2015. In the census period, an estimated 100 prisoners and 46 students benefitted. Until spring 2019, students engaged in literacy work with prisoners 1:1 or in small groups, from basic literacy to advanced creative writing. Since autumn 2019, students have co\-facilitated book discussion groups, working with small groups of prisoners. Placements occurred once weekly for six weeks. The placement runs in final year, alongside Schwan’s research\-led option “ *Crime in Text & Film*” which most placement students take. 

 Anonymous testimonials from prisoners working with students 1:1 indicate the scheme’s benefits for self\-esteem, motivation, concrete progress with literacy skills, tasks such as essay\- or playwriting, and social interaction. Prisoners commented that *“my self\-esteem and wellbeing is a lot better”* and that the university peer’s *“engagement and enthusiasm helped my self\-confidence and her ideas positively influenced my work.”* One said they had learned about *“friendship and being able to work with other people.”* Another stated that *“working with the students has given me a sense of general wellbeing and that any age can learn new skills.”* Signalling the scheme’s ability to make prisoners feel heard and valued, a 66\-year old said that *“It’s nice when a ‘bright young person’ finds value in your work*” while a reading group participant saw a clear benefit in that the students *“didn’t treat us like idiots*” **\[C1\]**. 

 The collective book discussion format resulted in additional personal and social benefits, with prisoners reporting that they had become *“more open minded”* on book choice, had developed a more analytical approach to books \( *“I’m now reading more into the books*”\) and after participating in the group were “ *able to debate books without starting an argument*.” Highlighting the scheme’s value in providing additional access to reading and writing opportunities, many testimonials ask for more or longer sessions of this kind **\[C1\]**. 

 For logistical and confidentiality reasons, it is impossible to assess the longer\-term impact on prisoners, but a 2020 survey of Edinburgh Napier graduates who had participated in the placement indicates a lasting effect on their confidence, social attitudes and professional practice. One graduate \(participated 2016\) who now works as a careers advisor, reports that the placement *“helped to emphasise the real\-life people behind words like ‘prisoner’* *or ‘inmate’”* which shaped his *“holistic*” professional approach to people with convictions, concluding: *“I really feel that the placement played a role in helping to shape the passion for social justice which is key to my professional identity and has supported me in my work since then.”* Another \(participated 2016\) who now works as a secondary school teacher says that the placement *“changed* \[his\] *views”* on prisoners and *“has enabled* \[him\] *to be more critical when confronted with discussions or ideas about prisoners, prisons, and crime.”* This new perspective is now informing his *“many conversations with students and colleagues about \[his\] prison placement.”* One graduate \(participated 2017\) commented on the new understanding gained on module and placement: *“I had \(ignorantly\) never really thought of writing and the arts in prison much before. The module content paired with the prison placement made me appreciate that great literature and creativity can really come from anywhere\!”* \[ **C1\]**. 

 **Impact on Prison Education Practice, Capacity Building and Related Awards** 

 In 2017, the Scottish Prison Service \(SPS\) introduced Annual Learning Plans for each prison, listing approved learning opportunities. According to the Head of Learning and Skills at SPS, the Edinburgh Napier placement features “ *as a core aspect of our Annual Learning Plans at HMP Edinburgh as it undoubtedly contributes to the enhancement of self\-esteem and confidence of learners through tailored provision and person\-centred educational support*” **\[C2\]**. This highlights Schwan’s impact on social welfare through improved access to educational opportunities for a particularly disadvantaged group of individuals. 

 UK\-wide awareness of this innovative educational model was raised through an article on Edinburgh Napier’s partnership in the Prisoners’ Education Trust eNewsletter/website \(October 2014\) **\[C3\]**. As a result of the research and ensuing partnership, in 2016 Schwan was invited to serve on the National Advisory Group on Prison Education chaired by the SPS’s Head of Learning and Skills with responsibility for all of Scotland’s prisons **\[C2\]**. In 2015, Schwan co\-organized a workshop with the Inside\-Out Prison Exchange Program’s founder Lori Pompa \(Temple University, Philadelphia\) which was attended by educational practitioners and participants from the arts, government and voluntary sector in Scotland **\[C4\]**. The workshop led to the founding of the Scottish Universities\-Prisons \(UP\) Network in 2016. As co\-founder and co\-convenor, Schwan initiated this national capacity\-building platform for advice and good practice, now reaching over 50 members. Alongside a JISC mailing list, the Network created a webpage; Schwan co\-hosted its first conference attended by 51 people \(practitioners, ex\-prisoners and academics\) in March 2019, which was valued as *“a safe platform to reflect candidly”* and for its *“Mix of university and prison personnel”* **\[C5\]**. 

 In 2017, Schwan convened and co\-delivered a training seminar at the 2017 European Prison Education Association \(EPEA\) Conference in Vienna, demonstrating her international reach. The session introduced critical perspectives, e.g. the limitations of “bibliotherapy” as a model, and promoted the benefits of aspirational, collaborative learning to 19 people \(educational and criminal justice professionals\) from countries including Austria, Belarus and the USA; Schwan’s invited session report in the EPEA’s magazine reached the Association’s entire international membership **\[C6\]**. Schwan’s research and outreach are thus informing prison education practitioners in Scotland and internationally. According to the SPS’s Head of Learning and Skills, her initiative *“has been cited and recognised in an international context … as an example of educational innovation in the recent report of prison education by an international Expert Group and presented to the Council of Europe in October 2019”* **\[C2\]**. 

 Schwan’s partnership with SPS and Fife College won the 2016 *Herald* Higher Education Partnership Award, with the judges commenting that “ *this is a fantastic and brave project demonstrating a strong, sustained three\-way partnership*” **\[C7\]**.The original partnership has built capacity, leading to new links between two additional subject areas and other prisons \(Edinburgh Napier colleagues were subsequently awarded the 2017 *Herald* Higher Education Award for Widening Access for the HMPYOI Polmont Media Project\). 

 Schwan was invited by the SPS’s Head of Learning and Skills to co\-organise the 2016 International Prison Education Day at HMP Barlinnie – attended by prisoners, practitioners and academics – for which she secured funding to facilitate creative work with prisoners **\[C8\]**. The event won the European Prison Association Prize for best International Prison Education Day, providing a model of good practice to professionals across Europe **\[C2\]**. 

 **Enhancing Public Understanding through Talks, Performances and Media Coverage** 

 Talks on historical and contemporary prisoner self\-representation and prison education reached cross\-generational audiences, including an invited presentation at Exeter University’s *“Reading for Life”* \(April 2017\), predominantly for members of the University of the Third Age. As a then member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh’s Young Academy of Scotland, Schwan gave invited schools talks organized through the Royal Society in 2017, reaching 150 pupils aged 11 to 18 and one school’s entire student, staff and alumni population through publication in the school magazine **\[C9\]**. Following a sold\-out event at the National Library of Scotland \(January 2020; capacity: 60\) on nineteenth\-century execution broadsides, a type of street literature sold at public hangings, which was informed by Schwan’s monograph **\[O1\]**, attendees reported enhanced understanding of convict self\-representation in this popular genre, with one noting that *“It hadn’t occurred to me that the broadsides might give the ‘criminal’ a voice”* **\[C10\]**. 

 In 2018, Schwan was Co\-Investigator and Edinburgh Napier team lead for collaborative AHRC follow\-on funding for impact and engagement \(with Aston University; Edinburgh Napier share c. GBP35,000\), to raise awareness of First World War internment. Building on Schwan’s research expertise on prison history, prisoners’ voices and creativity in confinement **\[O1, O2, O4\],** she oversaw a performance as it would have been staged at Stobs Camp in the Scottish Borders, and served as consultant for an education resource on internment, which was distributed to Scotland’s thirteen publicly managed prisons **\[C11\]**. Sold\-out performances, with an accompanying leaflet **\[C11\]** and exhibition panels, reached 280 people \(audience members\) in three different cities, with an additional 176 views of the performance recording on YouTube **\[C12\]**. Following the performances, audience responses indicated new awareness of internment conditions *\(“learnt about internment in WWI in the Borders”*\), with attendees reporting that they *“had never put any thought into British PoW camps before today”* and another highlighting new insight into the human experience of internment: *“Really enjoyed the men in Stobs being portrayed as real people. We are used to dealing with the emptiness of Stobs.*” \[ **C13\]**. Schwan additionally contributed an invited “lockdown” lecture on “ *Creativity Behind the Barbed Wire*” to the virtual “Stobs Week” conference organised by Archaeology Scotland’s Stobs Camp Project in September 2020 \(44 views\) **\[C14\]**. 

 Large audiences were reached through media coverage in 2018, in *The Scotsman* \(19,000 print\-run; website 138,000 visitors/day\), *The National* and the BBC website \(9,600 hits\); Schwan further raised awareness of internment in interview on BBC Scotland’s flagship “Good Morning Scotland” \(28<sup>th</sup>  February 2018\), which typically attracts 120,000\-150,000 listeners a day, and an AHRC blog entry \(co\-authored with Davie\) \(298 views\) **\[C15\]**.

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 Dr Parkinson’s research has underpinned the academic development strategy, methods, and reach of the Council for At\-Risk Academics’ Syria Programme since March 2017, improving the academic capacity, connectedness, well\-being, and professional identity of hundreds of Syrian academics living in exile in Turkey. Participants have gained research and teaching capacity, and built networks through a programme of research\-informed activities. Since 2017, participants have submitted over 100 grant applications, published 30 peer\-reviewed outputs, and established independent Syrian\-led entities such as the Gaziantep\-based CSO Academic Centre for Development and Peace Studies. Dozens of participating Syrian academics in exile who continue to teach inside Syria are improving their teaching skills and enhancing Syrian higher education for thousands of Syrian learners. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 Since **March 2017**, Dr Tom Parkinson has led on a programme of action research with Syrian and UK academics participating in the Council for At\-Risk Academics \(Cara\) Syria Programme. Cara launched its Syria Programme \(Cara SP\) in Turkey in late 2016 to provide support to Syrian academics in the Middle East region affected by the Syria crisis, and its capacity\-building activities began in March 2017. Most Syrian academics forced into exile in Turkey, Lebanon, and elsewhere in the region have a strong desire to play a vital role in the future rebuilding of Syria and its HE and research sectors, but for now they urgently need opportunities to work, connect, and develop professionally **\[R4, R5\]**. 

 Action research seeks not only to understand but also to address real\-world problems and improve stakeholders’ situations through cycles of planning, action, and reflective evaluation. At Cara’s request, Parkinson and his colleagues have developed innovative participatory methods and action research frameworks to understand the academic development needs, priorities, and challenges of hundreds of Syrian academics living in exile in Turkey, and directly address these through the delivery of community development and capacity\-building activities on the Syria Programme **\[R3, R4, R5\]**. 

 Through Cara\-commissioned research reported in **\[R3\]**, Parkinson and colleagues \(McDonald and Quinlan\) elicited five key priority areas for Syrian academics in exile: 

1.  *Responsibility* towards Syria, the scientific community, their dependents, and themselves. Syrian exiled academics embody the country’s intellectual heritage and expertise. Research participants felt a great sense of responsibility towards younger generations of Syrian learners, and wished to participate in Syria’s rebuilding; 

1.  *Disciplinarity*: Working within and contributing to one’s discipline; 

1.  *Teaching:* Skills and approaches relevant to teaching in the Syrian context, both inside the country and in refugee and diaspora communities; 

1.  *Research:* Skills, resources, and opportunities; 

1.  *Collaboration* **:** Finding opportunities to participate in international academia and develop collaborative projects. 

 These five priority areas **\[R3\]** were directly used to guide the agenda, strategy, and delivery of the Cara SP’s academic development programme. Between **2017** and **2020**, workshops, mentoring, and online activities have been designed to target the self\-identified needs of participants. This programme of ongoing research **\[R3, R4, R5\]** has also generated rich insights into programme participants’ experiences of displacement and conflict; the impact displacement and conflict have had on Syrian academics’ work and community; and the implications for Syria’s intellectual future. Playing a leading role in Cara SP planning and delivery as chair of the Academic Development steering group and a lead facilitator of residential workshops, Parkinson has worked with Syrian and UK\-based colleagues to identify additional areas of concern that subsequent research has responded to directly. This research has included: 

1.  *Comparative experiences of higher education in \(post\-\)conflict and refugee contexts*. Through analysis of group processes, focus groups, and interview data collected from Cara SP participants, in **2018\-19,** Parkinson established that Syrian academics had a desire to connect with and learn from international counterparts who had experienced similar circumstances. In response, Parkinson secured GCRF funding and organised \(with Cara SP Director Kate Robertson\) and co\-chaired \(with Dr Juliet Millican, ICS\) a series of roundtables at the Swedish Consulate in Istanbul in **June 2019**. These roundtables brought together researchers from seven international contexts to explore how to sustain academic work and community under conditions of conflict, exile, or displacement. This dialogue revealed both commonalities and stark differences between international contexts that impact on academics’ work and well\-being. It also highlighted the affordances of international collectivism and solidarity in supporting beleaguered academic communities **\[R2\]**. 

1.  *Reconnecting Syrian academics in exile with learners in Syria*. Parkinson and colleagues’ \(Abdullateef and Sarmini\) **2018** evaluation of the use of blended technologies to teach emergency agricultural engineering methods **\[R1\]** led to a model for collaboration between NGOs, Syrian academics in exile, civil society, and community groups to support higher education delivery in Syria. 

1.  *Collaborative research and research writing in global North–South partnerships*. To build research capacity and international networks, Syrian researchers on the Cara SP have been paired with UK or international academics to conduct collaborative research since **June 2018**. Through analysis of research\-group dynamics, and the role of different types of expertise in the research\-writing process, Parkinson and colleagues \(Heron, Alajaj, Khuder\) identified effective strategies for collaborative research writing **\[R6\]**, resulting in evidence\-based models for writing support that have underpinned the design of several writing workshops, including a **2020** British Academy\-funded GCRF Writing Workshop.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Since its first academic development activities in **March 2017**, Parkinson and his colleagues’ collaborative action research has directly underpinned the agenda, strategy, design, and delivery of the Cara SP, for which Parkinson chairs the Academic Development Steering Group. Parkinson and colleagues’ research and engagement in this field have led to the development of multiple capacity\-building, academic development, and community development practices. Below are identified some of the key benefits that have arisen as a result, and which have supported hundreds of Syrian academics to continue their academic work whilst improving their well\-being and professional identity **\[a\]**. 

 **Advancing Cara SP’s Strategy, Methods, and Reach** 

 Between **2017** and **2020**, the number of international academics contributing to the Cara SP’s academic development activities has grown from eight to over 200, and the Cara SP cohort from 29 to over 400, with 160 regularly active participants **\[a, j\]**. Cara’s Executive Director, Stephen Wordsworth, praised the ‘transformative practices that have stemmed from Tom’s research’, asserting that ‘the action research that Tom has led has been instrumental in helping Cara to develop a strategy for the Syria Programme, and indeed a model for future comparable programmes \[and\] has played a critical part in advancing our understanding of Syrian academic needs and challenges, and in the development of the Programme’s methods and practice’ **\[a\]**. Similarly, in reference to the needs analysis undertaken by Parkinson and colleagues reported in **\[R3\]** and **\[R4\]**, the Cara SP’s independent evaluator applauded the ‘innovative processes \[used\] to identify \[…\] academic skills needs and participant priorities’ **\[i\]**, and confirmed that ‘\[the Cara SP\] has achieved significant results in terms of its intended outputs and towards outcomes. The programme improved skills and networks among Syrian academics and in particular succeeded in its intention to enable academic engagement by Syrian academics in exile in Turkey’ **\[j\]**. 

 **Improving Syrian Academics’ Well\-Being and Professional Identity** 

 Through a programme of activities targeted towards the priorities identified in Parkinson, McDonald, and Quinlan’s research **\[R3\],** the Cara SP has contributed to exiled Syrian academics’ greater sense of well\-being, belonging, and identity. As highlighted by Wordsworth: ‘participants attest to the transformative impact of the Syria Programme on their self\-efficacy, research and teaching capacities, professional opportunities, community cohesion and overall well\-being, enhancing their work as educators and researchers in both Turkish and non\-regime\-controlled universities in Northern Syria’ **\[a\]**. Participants have described the Cara SP as ‘a light in a very dark tunnel’: ‘I feel I am an academic again. I \[now\] have networks with other colleagues in the UK and even in Syria’; ‘I have felt reborn. This programme helps me to work in a team and improve my academic skills, especially in \[...\] scientific writing so I can prepare my work for publication’; ‘It encouraged me to work, to write something. To feel about myself as an academic. I had lost that feeling’ **\[b\]**. 

 **Building Syrian Academics’ International and Cross\-Sectoral Networks** 

 Since **2017**, Parkinson and his colleagues’ research has raised the profile of Syrian academia and the Cara SP, stimulating the growth of an international network of more than 200 academics, including experts and stakeholders in the fields of displacement and \(post\-\)conflict higher education. Wordsworth confirmed that ‘Tom’s publications and research presentations to universities and professional bodies have contributed to the in\-kind support from which the Programme has benefited \[…\] valued at well over £1 million’, adding that ‘Tom continues to apply the findings of his research to drive access to opportunity for marginalised Syrian academics’ **\[a\]**. As an example, Wordsworth highlighted that, in **2019**, Parkinson ‘secured GCRF funding \[…\] to support a four\-day roundtable held in June 2019 in lstanbul \[bringing\] academics together with academics from Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kenya, Northern lreland, Palestine, Serbia, and South Africa. \[…\]. ln his role as chair for the first two days, Tom contributed his research\-led expertise to this unique forum for knowledge\-sharing between international academics, joined by regional and international NGOs and UN agencies, an event and opportunity that was highly valued by participants informing attendees' organisational practice, helping to build solidarity and community for a growing international and cross\-sectoral alliance in support of Syrian academics’ **\[a\]**. 

 **Advancing the Syrian Academic Community, Partnerships, and Research Capacity** 

 Independent evaluator Teresa Hanley asserted that the Cara SP has ‘increased visibility of the Syrian participants to academia, policy makers and practitioners’ **\[j\]**, and that these encounters have catalysed a number of collaborations and initiatives that ‘move beyond the Cara Syria Programme’s direct activities to more sustainable academic engagement and indeed livelihoods’ **\[j\].** Hanley noted in particular that the roundtables in June 2019 had ‘brought participants together with international and local humanitarian responders to the Syria Crisis and academics from other parts of the world’, and that ‘participants interviewed noted their appreciation, particularly of the chance to discuss higher education development and other conflict\-affected countries’ experience’ **\[j\].** Following advice and encouragement from delegates at the research\-led round tables **\[c\],** several Cara SP academics established the Academic Centre for Development and Peace Studies \(ACDP\), a Syrian\-led civil society organisation and academic consortium in Gaziantep, Turkey, in **December 2019**. ACDP Co\-Director Shaher Abdullateef attested to the impact of the roundtables in creating the impetus for ACDP: ‘\[At the round tables\] we heard different cases \[from\] Belarus, Bosnia Herzegovina, Kenya, Northern Ireland, Palestine, Serbia and South Africa. It was very useful to develop ideas about how to organise \[…\] and what to do as a first step. \[…\] we finally established \[ACDP\] as a space to collect \[...\] and to conduct research relative to Syria context. The idea of empowering Syrian academics \[and\] rais\[ing\] their voices is older than two years \[but\] I wasn’t sure if this is the right way to do it. During the event we Syrian participants were more confident, and the way to connect \[with\] and involve \[…\] international academia was clearer, especially \[with\] great encouragement from the international participants.’ **\[c\]** Co\-Director Fateh Shaban meanwhile asserted that ‘the invaluable support that the Cara Syria Programme has provided to Syrian academics in exile \[…\] has helped us to sustain a working academic network and establish formal organisations such as our Centre, which now serves as a hub through which Syrian academics can access professional and research opportunities and engage effectively with stakeholders in Syria and in diaspora. \[…\] The directors of ACDP began our collaboration on the Cara Syria Programme, and our network of affiliate members comprises many Syrian Programme participants, as well as international experts whom we met at Cara’s Roundtables funded by the University of Kent in 2019’ **\[d\]**. 

 Evidence–based capacity building and support models developed by Parkinson and colleagues \(e.g. **\[R4, R6\]**\) have been implemented at several residential retreats and regular online events in 2018, 2019, and 2020. These have supported Syrian academics in writing over 100 grant applications; publishing over 30 peer\-reviewed outputs as authors or co\-authors \(2017\-20\) **\[a\]**, and attaining internationally recognised teaching fellowships **\[e\]**. 

 **Supporting Syrian Higher Education** 

 Parkinson’s and colleagues’ research to inform the Cara SP’s academic development strategy **\[R3, R4\]** has enhanced Syrian teaching and learning through targeted CPD for academics teaching in Turkey and in northern Syria **\[a\]**. Abdullateef, Parkinson, and Sarmini’s research **\[R1\]** has enabled and enhanced distance teaching for learners in conflict\-affected regions of northern Syria, delivered by exiled academics. For example, Rahmet Relief Foundation \(a regional NGO\) noted that this research **\[R1\]** has directly ‘enabled effective delivery of vital agricultural knowledge to learners in Syria, which has greatly benefitted \[…\] stakeholders \[whilst also\] providing vital insight for others offering similar interventions’ **\[f\]**. Another NGO partner, Shafak, declared that this research had led to ‘refinement of educational delivery models that now ensure sustainable knowledge and support to learners and professionals, online, offline and through physical learning tools’ **\[g\]**. Furthermore, learners in northern Syria reported that the educational interventions developed through Parkinson’s and colleagues’ research provided an invaluable source of specialist training, and ‘expressed their appreciation of this learning and its value to their education and livelihoods’ **\[g\]**. One participant noted: ‘\[It\] helped me to review the knowledge on protected agriculture that I took during my studies which were cut off, and also increased my knowledge about methods and areas of use of aquaculture’ \[h\]**. Shafak’s CEO, Omar Atik, stated that these interventions were ‘building hope, community and solidarity’ \[g\]**.

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The Wilberforce Institute critically investigates the history of transatlantic slavery to inform and to drive responses to modern slavery. In 2015 the Institute was awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for its impact on society regarding: i\) the quantification of slavery, and ii\) anti\-slavery opinion\-building. This award acknowledged the prominent role the Institute played in shaping the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The Institute’s contribution to the development of the Global Slavery Index and Multiple Systems Estimation \(MSE\) tool led to a radical reassessment by the UK Government of the number of people enslaved in the UK. The Institute’s interactive anti\-slavery opinion\-building tools have driven modern slavery prevention campaigns in schools across the UK, and in West Africa. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The legacy of William Wilberforce is reflected in the University of Hull’s continued fight against all forms of modern slavery and exploitation. The Hull native William Wilberforce used his position as MP to lead the British campaign to abolish the slave trade. **Following a £3 million strategic investment by the University, The Wilberforce Institute was founded in 2005 and its inaugural patron was Archbishop Desmond Tutu. It is the oldest research institute of its kind in the United Kingdom.** The Institute is one of the leading international research centres in the world working on slavery\-related issues. Its unique blend of historical and contemporary perspectives enables the Institute to add depth and nuance to tackling the challenges of the present, particularly when it comes to the structure and organisation of modern slavery and the formulation of strategies to bring it to an end. **Working with other leading historical and modern slavery research centres across the world, the Institute’s activities are supported by a portfolio of collaborative external research grants worth approximately £15.5 million.** 

 The following key research findings \(KRFs\) underpin the impact: 

1.  **KRF1**: <ins> **The extent of Global Slavery has been significantly underestimated**</ins> 

 **The underpinning research represents historical \(Professor Richardson\) and social science \(Professor Bales\) methodological innovation, which provides new accessible insights into the quantifiable numbers of people forced into slavery both in the past and in the present.** 

 The launch of a multi\-source online database of 35,000 transatlantic slave voyages \( [www.slavevoyages.org](http://www.slavevoyages.org/)\) was the culmination of a collaborative international project. The database became the basis of several publications including an *Atlas of the Transatlantic Slave Trade* \(2010\) **\(3a\)**.  Harvard Professor and Macarthur Fellow, Henry Louis Gates, has described the Atlas as ‘the Rosetta Stone of slave historiography’. In contemporary research, Professor Bales has led governmental and criminal justice understanding and awareness of the extent of modern slavery, creating the impetus for campaigns to prevent exploitation and trafficking **\(3b\)**. His contribution to developing **new methodological tools for measuring the extent of modern slavery across the globe has also been ground\-breaking in uncovering the hidden levels of modern slavery** \( **3c\).** His research was recognised with the $100,000 Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Promoting World Order in 2011 and his development of the Global Slavery Index has been publicly acknowledged by Hillary Clinton, Bill Gates, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Julia Gillard. 

 **KRF2**: <ins> **There is an urgent need to historicize the growing body of work on modern slavery**</ins> 

 **This key insight builds on Professor Oldfield’s research on anti\-slavery opinion building during the nineteenth century and its relevance to understanding the dynamics of modern social movements, including the modern anti\-slavery movement**. 

 Professor Oldfield’s research has been instrumental in **developing the concept of an anti\-slavery ‘usable past’** that demonstrates a continuous link between the past and the present, through what can be described as an active ‘protest memory’ **\(3d & 3e\)**. From these ideas, Oldfield developed ‘ *Stolen Lives’* \(AHRC,  [www.stolenlives.co.uk](http://www.stolenlives.co.uk/)\) *and ‘The Antislavery Usable Past’* \(AHRC *\),* working collaboratively with Professor Bales whose research at the Wilberforce Institute played a vital role in raising awareness about modern slavery from schools through to governments and international NGOs **\(3b & 3f**\). Together, the interdisciplinary team developed new methods of presenting and disseminating information by juxtaposing the experiences of enslaved people from the eighteenth to twenty\-first centuries in an easy to access format. 

 The success of these two projects provided the springboard for further collaborative bids that explored the role of slavery and colonialism in contemporary society \(Horizon 2020 European Colonial Heritage\), and in 2019 this combined body of research culminated in the Wilberforce Institute being included in the £10 million Prime Minister’s Modern Slavery and Human Rights Policy and Evidence Centre funded by UKRI/AHRC.

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The impact strategy of the Wilberforce Institute is to raise public awareness of historical and modern slavery to influence **public policy and education**. In achieving this, the Institute has prioritised two distinct areas of activity that flow directly from its key research findings: 

1.  <ins> **The Quantification of Slavery**</ins> **\(KRF1\)** 

 <ins>Pathways to Impact:</ins> **The Institute’s role in developing the metrics for the Global Slavery Index \(GSI\) provided the first comprehensive and accessible measure of the extent of modern slavery in 167 countries around the world.** Aimed at informing practitioners and policymakers, the GSI has been disseminated around the world. The 2014 GSI prompted a response from 38 governments and generated more than 700 news articles and broadcasts in all regions of the globe. 

 <ins>Impact:</ins> As a member of the Walk Free Expert Advisory Group **\(EVID 1\)**, Professor Bales spearheaded the design, development and dissemination of the GSI which provides the key international measure of the extent and response to modern slavery **\(EVID 2\). The GSI is used by governments, researchers, NGOs and charities around the world to support the liberation of slaves and their reintegration into society.** As the lead author of the 2014 GSI, Professor Bales’s research led the Walk Free Foundation to co\-found the London\-based Freedom Fund – a multi\-million\-pound NGO whose sole work is slavery eradication. Professor Bales became a Director of the Freedom Fund which has gone on to impact 765,628 lives and liberate 28,040 people **\(EVID 3\)**. 

 As the driving force behind uncovering the hidden extent of modern slavery, Professor Bales has been at the forefront of the global campaign to raise awareness of the suffering of exploitation of 35.8 million people across the globe \(GSI 2014, **EVID 2**\). **As the world’s only country\-by\-country estimate of people living in slavery, the GSI maps the prevalence, vulnerability and governmental response to global slavery and has raised the visibility of the victims of modern slavery across the globe.** Kevin Hyland, the first UK Independent Modern Slavery Commissioner, confirms the international reach of this research: *“Kevin Bales led development of the Global Slavery Index \(GSI\) in collaboration with UN and Australian actors, providing estimates of rates of slavery in 167 countries across the world which was used to encourage Australia to introduce their own Modern Slavery Act in 2018.”* **\(EVID 4\).** 

 Building on the successful launch of the GSI, Professor Bales developed a new collaboration with the Chief Scientific Officer at the Home Office to co\-produce the methodological innovation called Multiple Systems Estimation \(MSE\) **\(EVID 5\). This resulted in a radical reassessment by the UK Government of the number of people enslaved in Britain, revising the figure upwards to between 10,000 and 13,000 men, women and children: roughly four times the figure produced by the National Crime Agency’s Human Trafficking Centre in 2013.** Taken together, the GSI and MSE changed our understanding of the prevalence of Modern Slavery in the UK and provided the impetus for a new British Government Modern Slavery Strategy and Bill. Launched by the then Home Secretary, Theresa May in 2014, the Modern Slavey Bill had the full, written endorsement of Professors Bales and Silverman **\(EVID 6\) and came into law as the Modern Slavery Act in 2015.**  The Act provides the first comprehensive powers to the Courts specifically designed for combatting modern slavery, and created the position of the UK Independent Anti\-Slavery Commissioner.  According to the 2020 UK Annual Report on Modern Slavery, there have been 1257 convictions since the Act was introduced, delivering justice to many more thousands of victims. 

 Launching the UK Government’s Modern Slavery Strategy \(and Modern Slavery Bill\) in November 2014, Theresa May commented on the revised estimates provided by Bales and Silverman: *“The first step to eradicating the scourge of modern slavery is acknowledging and confronting its existence. The estimated scale of the problem in modern Britain is shocking and these new figures starkly reinforce the case for urgent action.”* **\(EVID 6\)**. The role of Professor Bales’s research in shaping the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act \(2015\) is further reinforced by Kevin Hyland,  who commended the impact of Bales’ work on the quantification of modern slavery: *“\[It\]* *resulted in a dramatic reassessment of the scale of modern slavery in the UK and the figures established via the MSE continue to be widely quoted within official documents relating to modern slavery in the UK – not least in the Government’s Modern Slavery Strategy 2014 which set out its approach to tackling the issue and later paved the way for the introduction of the Modern Slavery Act 2015*.” **\(EVID 4\).** 

 In recognition of his contribution to developing the Multiple Systems Estimation \(MSE\) tool whilst working at the Wilberforce Institute **,** Professor Bales was awarded the 2018 ESRC Prize for Outstanding International Impact for ** **“helping to provide the first reliable estimates of modern slavery. National and global slavery estimates, including Walk Free's Global Slavery Index on which Professor Bales collaborates, are the baseline against which the United Nations can measure progress towards its Sustainable Development Goal of ending slavery by 2030”.** 

 <ins> **Anti\-Slavery Opinion Building</ins> \(KRF2\)** 

 <ins>Pathways to Impact</ins>: The Institute has designed and delivered public campaigns to raise awareness of historical and modern slavery, using music, film, teaching aids, exhibitions and web resources. Between 2015 and 2021 the *Stolen Lives* website had 34,000 pageviews and 8,185 views of the Repairing Broken Lives video resources. Alongside *Stolen Lives* \(2015\), the *Antislavery Usable Past* project \(2019\), the \#HiddenInPlainSight campaign \(launched in November 2016, which placed ‘human packaging’ at high\-footfall locations\), and the \#BreakTheChain campaign \(launched in London in 2018, using a ‘human vending machine’\) all drew attention to the 25 million people trapped in forced labour around the world. 

 <ins>Impact</ins>: **The opinion\-building initiatives developed by the Wilberforce Institute have been adopted by many key stakeholders and have directly informed national public broadcasting campaigns designed to bring modern slavery to the attention of the British people. This included TV adverts, and **The Telegraph** and **Daily Mail** print and digital advertising** **\(EVID 7\).** As Kevin Hyland, the first UK Independent Modern Slavery Commissioner confirms, the strap line of the Hull University campaign ‘hidden in plain sight’ has inspired subsequent anti\-slavery campaigns, helping to highlight the role that the public can play in identifying potential victims of exploitation: *“Following the ‘Hidden in Plain Sight’ campaign, the phrase was then incorporated into a national media campaign on modern slavery and continues to be used in the bulk of public literature. I have personally participated in hundreds of events where the term is used including a BBC Radio Four interview following this campaign by the Wilberforce Institute to discuss some of its findings and the role the public can play in helping to identify potential victims”.* **\(EVID 4\)**. 

 Similarly, **‘Stolen Lives’, led by Professor Oldfield has raised awareness of slavery at over 60 different public events and its educational materials have been used in schools across the UK.** The Acting General Secretary of the NASUWT comments on the tangible benefits the Stolen Lives campaign has had for teachers and students: *“NASUWT commends the work of the Institute on the Stolen Lives project and felt it such an important issue that they provided a stand for Stolen Lives at the NASUWT Annual Conference in 2016, hosted two workshops at the NASUWT Women Teachers’ Consultation Conference and two workshops at their BME Teachers’ Consultation Conference, collectively reaching almost 800 NASUWT members. The NASUWT also committed £6000 to the project, specifically to ensure that the NASUWT website was kept updated with the Stolen Lives work and that all 300,000 of our members had free access to the project’s resources on account of how indispensable they are for teachers working on this difficult, yet immensely important topic.”* \( **EVID 8\).** 

 **Stolen Lives** has also had international impact, most notably in Sierra Leone where it proved the inspiration for an exhibition on modern slavery at the National Museum of Sierra Leone \(2017\),** the first of its kind. Subsequently, the British Council in Sierra Leone, working in collaboration with the Wilberforce Institute, arranged for the translation of songs from *Stolen Lives* into local languages and used them as resources in its *Connecting Classrooms* programme. To date this has reached over 30,000 students and helped to raise awareness of modern slavery in Sierra Leone, West Africa.  As the former Country Director and Project Lead of the British Council in Sierra Leone readily attests: *“The British Council in Sierra Leone used Stolen Lives as part of a school programme designed to initiate discussions about modern slavery through performance, debate, film and the visual arts. This programme, which I project led, called ‘Open Your Eyes” \(referencing one of the specially written songs for Stolen Lives\) directly involved 2000 students from ages 12 to 16 but indirectly reached some 30,000 in the wider school community and far more through media outlets.* *This work was integral in increasing knowledge, awareness and understanding around the topics of modern slavery and human trafficking amongst the students and their teachers and not least the wider school community \(parents, the police, church and mosque leaders\); equally, it was crucial in assisting prevention efforts by arming children with a better education of the risks facing them.”* **\(EVID 9\).** 

 **Finally, and importantly, the work of the Wilberforce Institute is also shared with the local schools and communities in the Humber region.** Performances from *Stolen Lives* have been held locally at Hull's Freedom Festival which attracts audiences of over 130,000. Whilst the Wilberforce Institute has worked closely with the Freedom Festival over many years, the Artistic Director and Joint Chief Executive of Freedom Festival singles out the *Stolen Lives* programme at the 2015 Festival for special mention: *“We were delighted to include Stolen Lives in our 2015 programme. The two live performances, involving three local schools, had a significant impact, not just in terms of underlining and articulating the serious message behind the Freedom Festival, but also in bringing to the public a real insight into the fact that slavery continues to occur today, even in our own communities.”* **\(EVID 10\).** 

 **In 2015 the Wilberforce Institute was awarded the Queens Anniversary Prize** for Further and Higher Education because it had *“won global recognition for its applied research into slavery in all its forms and for bringing the lessons of the past, through its ground\-breaking Global Slavery Index, to the combating of modern slavery”* **\(EVID 11\).**

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Delgado’s influential collaborations with filmmakers, distributors, film programmers, and festivals have led to wide\-ranging and intersecting impacts. Her research on Spanish and Latin American cinema and performance has led to impact in the following ways: \(i\) generating new ways of thinking that have influenced creative and industry practices in film programming and distribution; \(ii\) enhancing cultural understanding relating to artistic production from Spain and Latin America; \(iii\) contributing to the production of new cultural artefacts in Spain and Argentina. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Since arriving at Central \(1 October 2015\), Delgado has built on a body of work, commenced at Queen Mary University of London \(2001–2015\) \(RO1\), relating to issues of trans\-cultural representation in Spanish\- and Catalan\-language screen and stage cultures. Exploring Spain’s position within broader cultural histories of conflict and exile, Delgado has expanded her studies of actresses María Casares and Margarita Xirgu into a Spanish\-language publication that has reached a new non\-Anglophone readership \(RO4: 183–252, 63–134\). Analysing the output of Spanish actors, directors, and companies, and their transnational circulation through festival and touring networks \(RO4\), she has extended understandings of Spain’s position as a marginalised ‘other’ on the fringes of Europe and of the complex, diasporic formation of Hispanic culture in the twentieth and twenty\-first centuries. 

 Questions of transnational cultural representation have led Delgado to develop a new strand of research since 2015, exploring cultural discourses integral to histories of dictatorship, forced disappearances, and transnational justice in Spain \(1939–1975\) and Argentina \(1976–1983\). Whether considering Almodóvar’s 2013 film *I’m So Excited\!* as a comment on the failing of Spain’s democracy \(RO2\) or the institutionalisation of memory in Argentina enunciated in the 2009 Oscar\-winning political thriller *The Secret in Their Eyes* \(RO3: 251–55\), this research consistently articulates the role culture can play in dialogue with political and legal institutions in societies emerging from authoritarian regimes, by disseminating and facilitating demands for justice and ensuring they are met. By focusing both on arts practices ‘imagined, performed, and enacted at the intersection of memory, fiction, and politics’ \(RO3: 262\) and on the narrative control and problematic rhetoric that underpins the construction of ‘official’ histories in Spain and Argentina \(RO3: 245\), these approaches have proved key to her Co\-Investigator role on the AHRC\-funded project ‘Staging Difficult Pasts’ \(RG1\). The deployment of a methodology of active collaboration with filmmakers, curators, and directors — progressed in *A Companion to Latin American Cinema*, ‘Disappearing Acts’, and her work with Argentine theatre\- and film\-maker Lola Arias \(RO3, RO5, RO6\) — has enabled the research to be driven by ethnographic observations of rehearsals or film shoots, and explorations of creative processes with the artists concerned. Delgado’s research takes a culturally interpretative and politically committed approach to understandings of process and product — an approach that permeates all aspects of its dissemination, from public masterclasses and other audience engagement activities to journalistic and scholarly publications.

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Conceived, developed, and shared with her collaborators in the cultural sector, Delgado’s research builds impact generation directly into its methodology. Her active collaboration with leading figures and organisations in international film production, distribution, and reception has led to the following sets of interlinked impacts on professional practices, cultural understanding, and the creation of new cultural artefacts. 

 **1. Generating new ways of thinking about creative practice that have enabled film programmers, distributors, and artists to reach UK audiences** 

 Delgado’s research\-led collaborations with film programmers have influenced their professional practices, developing new UK audiences for Spanish\-, Basque\-, Galician\-, and Catalan\-language features and documentaries often marginalised in a cultural sector dominated by Anglophone outputs. Her work with industry professionals on the exhibition and reception of new Spanish and Latin American cinema has been particularly influential through her role as a programming advisor for the UK’s biggest film festival of its kind, the BFI London Film Festival \(LFF\), and her consultation by the Institute of Contemporary Arts \(ICA\), the London Spanish Film Festival, and UK\-based film distributors Network Distributing, New Wave, and Second Run. The Director of the LFF, Tricia Tuttle, attests to Delgado’s research input as ‘an integral part’ of the LFF programming team, programming ‘94 films from Spain and Latin America \[between 2015–2020\] that attracted audiences of over 38,000’ \(S2\). Tuttle identifies Carla Simón’s *Summer 1993* and Lila Avilés’ *The Chambermaid*, which secured successful UK distribution post\-LFF screenings, partly as a consequence of Delgado’s ‘advocacy and research \[which\] has been so valuable in a market that routinely overlooks female filmmakers’ \(S2\). ‘Spurred by her \[Delgado’s\] enthusiasm, knowledge and insights’ about *The Chambermaid*, Robert Beeson, Managing Director of New Wave Films, specialising in releasing foreign\-language arthouse titles in the UK and Ireland, ‘watched it and decided to release it. \[… It\] went on to be our most successful film of 2019’ \(S8\). In all, 34% of the films Delgado has programmed have been picked up for distribution in the UK or on streaming platforms, ‘despite’ as Tuttle observes, ‘a very difficult UK market for independent and foreign language work’ \(S2\). 

 Joana Granero, Director of the London Spanish Film Festival, recognises that she has consistently sought Delgado’s programming advice with 106 films presented between Autumn 2015 and December 2020, further inviting her to host 8 public interviews for the Festival since Autumn 2015 \(S10\). She testifies to the impact of Delgado’s research in her own programming vision: ‘providing audiences with access to work that might not otherwise be seen in the UK and enhancing through her on stage interviews their engagement with that work’ \(S10\). Furthermore, she identifies Delgado’s article ‘Disappearing Acts’ as ‘particularly influential in this respect, demonstrating the ways in which she engages creative artists in discussions about their work, articulating a poetics of that which is often invisible in the final product. It is indeed this focus that so marks her recent research and proves so relevant to those of us curating public events around the exhibition of a film in a cultural context different to that in which the film was produced’ \(S10\). 

 At the ICA, both a cinema venue and distributor, Delgado has co\-programmed over 25 films since 2016 \(reaching audiences of approximately 3,000\), given advisory input for the annual Frames of Representation Festival \(2017–2020\), and initiated ‘Latin America Monthly’ \(LAM\) in 2017. Nico Marzano, the ICA’s Head of Cinema, confirms her influence on his programming practice: ‘Delgado’s thorough knowledge has also majorly informed my own curatorial practice. \[…\] Her research in *A Companion to Latin American Cinema* — shared in development with me — and “Disappearing Acts” have provided indispensable methodological approaches to the creative process of making films \(with a particular focus on work with actors\) in Latin America and Spain that have led to the invitations I have made to her to collaborate with us here at the ICA’ \(S3\). Moreover, he testifies to the role of LAM in bringing ‘contemporary and often in the UK unknown’ films to London audiences, particularly noting Delgado’s role in the success of ‘Alison McAlpine’s *Cielo* \(2018\) and Michelle Memran’s *The Rest I Make Up* \(2018\) — two important, critically acclaimed documentaries that would have remained unseen to the audience without Delgado’s suggestions to give them a run in the ICA cinemas’ \(S3\). 

 Sebastian Lelio, Chile’s first Oscar Winner for Best Foreign\-language feature for *A Fantastic Woman* \(2017\), describes Delgado as ‘a very relevant figure for those of us who make cinema from Latin America’; her ‘contribution to the dissemination of new filmmakers is very concrete and very powerful’ \(S4\). Lelio cites Delgado’s film journalism, her selection of his films for LFF, and a career interview for a 2018 BFI retrospective as significant means through which she has increased his presence in Anglophone markets: ‘I have been fortunate in that Maria has followed my career through various films and has always disseminated them in various spheres \[…\], always with a sharp and consistent gaze, always generous, informed, incisive’ \(S4\). 

 Overall, the reach of Delgado’s impact with programmers and filmmakers is demonstrated in audiences of 47,852 for her programming activities, generating GBP470,724 in ticket sales \(S2, S3, S10\). 

 **2. Enhancing cultural understanding relating to cinema from Spain and Latin America** 

 Through disseminating her research — including sharing her research in progress with over 30 distributors, cinemas, programmers, producers — Delgado has had significant impact in enhancing cultural understanding of Spanish\- and Catalan\-language artistic production. Tim Beddows, Managing Director of Network Distributing Ltd, a UK\-based independent film and home entertainment distributor, considers Delgado ‘pivotal in our promotional efforts to bring Latin American cinema to the UK, from acquisition to distribution, via Q&As, talks, events and much more’ \(S7\). He stresses especially her input into the releases of Pablo Larraín’s *The Club* and *Neruda* in 2016 and 2017, including contributions for BBC News and interviews for the DVDs of both features, as a means of enriching audience engagement with the films: ‘We’ve found her knowledge indispensable and she is essential for engaging with both talent and audiences’ \(S7\). Likewise, for Mehelli Modi, the founder and Managing Director of Second Run, UK distributors of international independent cinema: ‘Delgado has always been at the top of my list for someone to host conversations with the filmmakers at those premieres or special screenings because her research is so effective in enabling cultural understandings of their work, rooted in their particular cultural contexts and creative processes’ \(S11\). Delgado’s activities in this area include: introducing 11 films and conducting over 60 public Q&As and masterclasses with Iberian and Latin American filmmakers from Mariano Llinás to Pedro Costa, as well as LFF Screen Talks with Lucrecia Martel on the premiere of *Zama* \(2017\) and Alfonso Cuarón \(2018\) for *Roma*. Tuttle attests to the ways in which Delgado’s contribution shaped understanding of *Roma*, which ‘went on to win the Best Film at the British Academy of Television Awards in 2019’, the first Spanish\-language film to do so ‘in more than a decade’: ‘For the distributor, Netflix, its BFI London Film Festival premiere and the \[Delgado’s\] Screen Talk with Alfonso Cuarón were the vital first events in that very successful Awards’ campaign’ \(S2\). Beeson, who bought *Zama* for release in the UK, credits Delgado’s ‘involvement’ in its distribution as enabling New Wave Films ‘to do many more things than usual with \[director\] Lucrecia Martel’ — Delgado contributed Q&As, a masterclass, a public interview at the BFI, and an interview for New Wave’s DVD release of the film \(S8\). Beddows concludes ‘the overarching effect of her involvement has been to significantly enhance cultural understandings of materials from non\-Anglophone languages’ \(S7\). 

 According to Kieron Corless, the Deputy Editor of *Sight & Sound*, Delgado is the magazine’s ‘most expert and respected contributor in the field of Spanish\-language cinema’ \(S6\), contributing 22 reviews since 1 October 2015. *Sight & Sound*’s features and reviews habitually appear just before a film is released and Corless notes their sway in setting the tone for reception of a film in the UK whilst also increasing public understanding and engagement and, ultimately, audiences \(the magazine sells approximately 16,000 print copies and receives 400,000 online views per month\) \(S6\). He goes on to testify that ‘Delgado’s own contributions are models of lucidity and interpretative acuity that not only help enhance our readers’ understanding of the work in question, but will also doubtless form the groundwork for future research’ \(S6\). Delgado’s influence in enriching cultural understandings of complex, genre\-defying work led to Lola Arias requesting that she undertake the press notes for *Theatre of War*, her debut film’s prize\-winning premiere at the 2018 Berlin Film Festival. In addition, her specialist features on Almodóvar have served as intermediary transmitters of ongoing research, recognised by Corless as ‘a lens into the more political dimension of his recent films’ \(S6\). 

 This generation of critical context for the cultural understanding of one of the world’s leading filmmakers was also crucial to Delgado’s role as advisory curator for the BFI’s 2016 Almodóvar retrospective, for which she wrote all brochure/website copy and programmed public events, chaired the opening panel, and conducted interviews with actresses Rossy de Palma and Marisa Paredes, and a career interview with Almodóvar \(subsequently viewed online by 9,239 people\). The retrospective was seen by 14,176 people at the BFI and subsequently at HOME Manchester. Delgado’s contribution, which included media appearances promoting the season on BBC’s *Woman’s Hour* and *The Robert Elms Show*, was described as ‘indispensable’ by the BFI’s then Director of Cinemas: *‘*Her dedicated research, intimate knowledge and inspiring approach helped us draw new audiences in to see Almodóvar’s wonderful films and to learn more about them. \[…\] This was \[…\] one of the highlights of the year for the BFI’ \(S2\). In the aftermath of the retrospective, Almodóvar himself acknowledged the significance of his collaboration with Delgado: ‘Maria Delgado is the best bridge I have been able to find to explain, deepen, and transmit my films in a culture as different from ours as the Anglo\-Saxon one. The understanding of everything I have done as a director and writer, of the social and cultural environment of where I come from and of the general context of references that make up my work find in Maria not only the best translation but the greatest complicity’ \(S5\). 

 **3. Contributing to the production of new cultural artefacts in Spain and Argentina** 

 The impact of Delgado’s work in terms of enhancing cultural understanding relating to Spanish\-language cultural production is extended through the contribution her research has made to the production of new cultural artefacts. Her research on the Spanish actress María Casares \(RO4\) led to an invitation to contribute to a new TVE2 \(Spanish National Television\) documentary on Casares, *El todo o la nada*. The film’s director, Elisabeth Anglarill, acknowledges Delgado’s formative influence on its conception and structure: ‘the chapter dedicated to María Casares in her book *“Otro” teatro español* was of great help. Indeed, the documentary’s narrative is built around two voices: that of Casares’ biographer in Spain, who compiles details from her personal history, and that of Maria Delgado, who explores her complete artistic trajectory’ \(S1\). Produced as part of TVE2’s award\-winning *Imprescindibles* series and broadcast on 29 December 2019, achieving a 1.7% share of viewing figures \(271,000 viewers\) on first transmission, the documentary remains available on the RTVE website, where it has been viewed 13,593 times by 9,428 unique users \(S1\). 

 Delgado’s collaboration, as part of the ‘Staging Difficult Pasts’ \(RG1, RG2\) project, with Buenos Aires ESMA Memory Museum \(the site of a clandestine centre of detention and torture during the 1976–1983 military dictatorship\) has led to dramaturgical input into a new film produced by El Pampero Cine. Invited by ESMA’s Museum Director, Alejandra Naftal, to curate one of the Museum’s monthly 5 o’clock visits — exploring new ways of thinking about the museum’s collection for visitors — Delgado and Sosa \(Staging Difficult Pasts PDRA\) brought into artistic dialogue testimonies from a Spanish verbatim play based on the 2012 trial of Judge Baltasar Garzón \(for investigating forced disappearances during the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath\) and those from Argentine blood relatives of disappeared persons in ESMA’s archive of the trials. Delgado and Sosa’s collaborative dramaturgy and curation of the testimony, working with Argentine film director Alejo Moguillansky \(whose work is analysed in Delgado and Sosa’s co\-authored essay in RO3, pp. 238–69\), resulted in a 20\-minute film which now forms part of the Museum’s collection \(S9i\). Bringing together stakeholders in Human Rights discourse to debate transnational justice in Spain and Argentina \(including Argentine Federal Judge, Daniel Rafecas and founder of Spain’s Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, Emilio Silva Barrera\), the event was attended by more than 500 people. It attracted press coverage in 5 outlets \(S9i\), including leading newspaper *Página 12*, with participants observing that the co\-produced film generated enhanced understanding of how cultural heritage can be interpreted \(S9i, S9ii\). *Perfil*’s feature highlighted the decisive role of art in facilitating a transcultural conversation, ‘reviewing that which happens in the politics of a neighbouring country to perceive the importance of \[ESMA’s\] message’ \(S9iii\). The Director of Argentina’s National Archive of Memory, Mariana Tello, confirms the impact of Delgado and Sosa’s intervention which ‘transform\[ed\] the testimonies, from so many documents into performances embodied by actors different to the witnesses, unleash\[ing\] a new potentiality. It was very transformative; bringing together worlds that appear separated by spatial and temporal distance’ \(9ii\), such that the testimonies ‘no longer seem to be something pertaining to the \[specific\] victim but something that belongs to all of us’ \(S9i\). 

 In summary, the significance and the reach of the impact from Delgado’s research on representativity — whether it is the processes and practices of practitioners or the countering of dominant narratives — is attested to by the Spanish Ministry of Culture’s award of the Cross of Alfonso X the Wise presented to Delgado in 2017 for her contribution to Spanish\-language culture and by the 2018 Ramon Llull Foundation’s **Award for International Promotion of Catalan Creation** for ‘wide\-ranging efforts to bolster not only leading figures but also emerging Catalan theatre and film artists’ \(S12\).

###  1. Summary of the impact \(indicative maximum 100 words\) 

 The pioneering research of veterinary behaviourist Professor Daniel Mills \(University of Lincoln\) has led to global shifts in evidence\-based advances for the treatment of problem animal behaviour by owners and professionals, with consequent commercial impacts and changes to professional practice and professional body policy. Mills’ work on clinical indications, technologies and intervention efficacy underpins moves by multinational \(e.g. development of imepitoin by *Boehringer Ingelheim* for veterinary behaviour indications\) and smaller veterinary health companies into this sector, alongside the development and refinement of existing products, particularly with *Ceva Sante Animale* in the management of stress\-related disorders in pets using synthetic analogues of naturally occurring chemical signals \(Pheromonatherapy\). 
","
###  2. Underpinning research \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 **Evidence\-based advances for the assessment and treatment of problem animal behaviour:** 

 Professor Mills’ research **\[3.1\]** developed and validated the first suite of clinical instruments for assessing fearfulness in dogs \(Positive and Negative Activation Scale \-PANAS\), the Lincoln Sound Sensitivity Scale \(LSSS\) and the Lincoln Canine Anxiety Scale \(LCAS\), which have been used by Mills’ and others \[ *detailed in evidence 5.1, 5.2*\] to scientifically evaluate potential interventions ranging from commercial sound desensitisation products \(desensitisation recordings\), dietary, pheromone\-related and pharmaceutical interventions for fear\-related issues. 

 Research with Boehringer Ingelheim \(BI\) \(leaders in the field of veterinary neuropharmaceuticals, but with no behaviour portfolio\) examined potential behaviour indicators for their antiepileptic medication, “imepitoin”. An initial clinical case series **\[3.2\]**, alongside collaboration with CanCog \(Canada\) developing a preclinical laboratory dog model of noise fears **\[3.3\]** was followed by the use of LCAS for the objective assessment of noise sensitivities in relation to fireworks. This was the first multicentric double\-blind randomised placebo\-controlled study of imepitoin for problem behaviour to demonstrate its efficacy for noise phobias **\[3.4\]**. 

  

 **Research improving current interventions and extending behavioural indications.** 

 Continuing industry funded \(Ceva Sante Animale\) research at Lincoln explores pheromonal interventions to reduce stress in pets \(previously detailed in a REF2014 case\). This research is summarised in the research anthology “Adaptil Feliway Comprehensive References” **\[3.5\]**, in which Mills contributes at least twice as many publications on Dog Appeasing Pheromone \(DAP\) and three times the number of publications relating to Feline Facial Fraction F3 compared to any other academic. Research since 2000 has resulted in the development of a diffuser technology for the delivery of these mixtures, and the specific research contributions <ins> **\[**</ins>see **3.5\]** include: 

-  The first first peer\-reviewed evidence for both F3 \(2001\), and DAP \(2003\) of the  efficacy of the diffuser technology. 

-  The first peer\-reviewed journal publication \(2006\) demonstrating the efficacy of DAP  delivered via impregnated collar, based on work undertaken the previous year. This  publication was also the first to statistically describe the diversity of psychological  states underlying travel\-related problems, providing important insights into the  potential mechanism of action of DAP. 

-  The first publications for the following indications \(double\-blinded placebo\-controlled  studies\): 

  -  adaptation to the new home by puppies \(2003\), providing further insights into   mechanism and limitations, based on differential effects. 

  -  anxiety in the veterinary clinic \(2003\). 

-  The first blinded parallel randomised trial comparing DAP and Cat Appeasing  Pheromone for the management of social stress in mixed\-species homes \- a new  indication, and first published evidence of species\-specificity of these products **\[3.6\]**. 

-  Four journal publications and the only clinical trials on noise phobias in dogs \(2003\- 2008\), one of the biggest markets for DAP in the UK. 

-  The first meta\-analysis of any intervention for problem behaviour in companion  animals \(2009\), which provides the most definitive evidence of F3 efficacy beyond   placebo \(level 1a \-  [<ins>http://www.cebm.net/?o=1025</ins>](http://www.cebm.net/?o=1025)\).

###  4. Details of the impact \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 Professor Mills’ impact strategy centralises close collaboration with commerce, professional organisations and end\-users, and this has produced new evidence\-based treatments to ameliorate animal suffering.  Mills’ research has generated a series of pivotal changes necessary for improved animal welfare primarily via the development of novel, high quality, evidence\-based products, leading to deep **commercial impacts** for sector leaders, and **changes to professional practice and professional body policy**. 

 **Commercial Impacts.** 

 <ins>Product development and market expansion:</ins> During the census period, this research has been integral to the development, registration, launch and marketing of veterinary behaviour\-related products by both BI and Ceva. In the latter case **\[5.1\],** Mills’ research underpins and is cited in marketing materials for 56 countries and national television advertising campaigns for Feliway<sup>TM</sup> and Adaptil<sup>TM</sup>. For both, the novel delivery systems developed with Lincoln attract more global sales for Ceva than the original spray \(evidence via Ceva contact if required\). The simplicity and convenience of these delivery systems for pheromonatherapy, have been an integral part of the development of an “off the shelf” market for these and related products using our technological innovations. For example, Ceva have made a new cat pheromone product \(FeliwayFriends<sup>TM</sup> – delivering the cat appeasing pheromone\) available only in diffuser form; the AdaptilJunior<sup>TM</sup> range for puppies available through pet shops uses the DAP\-impregnated collar originally developed for adults. \[text removed for publication\] 

 <ins>Industrial research strategy</ins>: Both BI **\[5.2\]** and Ceva **\[5.1\]** have made major strategic shifts on the basis of Mills’ research insights. His research with BI underpinned the exceptional dual recognition by both US and European veterinary drug registration authorities of behavioural indication for imepitoin **\[5.3\],** enabling BI to enter the veterinary behaviour field with the first enteric medication for noise phobias in dogs and place imepitoin into the US market for the first time as a result. \[text removed for publication\] Clinical research practitioners internationally are now using Mills’ fundamental research into the assessment and diagnosis of negative emotional states to enable other companies to produce evidence\-based interventions for veterinary behaviour similarly aimed at improving animal welfare **\[5.4, 5.5\]**. 

 **Professional Practice and Policy Impacts.** 

 The significance of Mills’ research has extended beyond direct industry beneficiaries and into professional development for practitioners and the sector more widely. Through his sector collaborations with industry and both veterinary and behaviour associations, Mills has mobilised his research to enhance the knowledge, skills and attitudes of both behaviour specialists and the wider veterinary professions in this field. 

 Mills authored the standard text “Stress and Pheromonatherapy”, which is used by Ceva Animal Health to upskill both practitioners and staff new to the field of pheromonatherapy **\[5.1\]**. This training of the profession has underpinned sustained growth of pheromonatherapy during the census period, with new markets opening in important geographic regions globally, including Central and South America, New Zealand and most recently China; alongside increased use where the products were already available **\[5.1\]**. The professional impact of the pheromone research has reached the point that it is routinely included in standard reference texts for the profession **\[5.6\]** as well as specialist texts **\[5.7\]**. 

 Mills’ research on the efficacy of pheromonatherapy and imepitoin for noise phobias \(affecting 20\-50% dogs in industrialised countries\), also contributes materially to the opinion of professional bodies on this matter. For example, BSAVA’s position statement relating to fireworks **\[5.8\]** recommends that veterinary surgeons use “ *evidence\-based therapies*”, with specific references to the “ *use of pheromones*” and “ *short term medication*”. Imepitoin is currently one of only two licensed medications for this indication. 

 Mills’ research establishing that dogs are less stressed when exposed to DAP in the vet clinic provides the evidence for pheromonatherapy becoming an integral part of the international veterinary “FearFree” movement founded in 2016 \[5.9\].  Fear Free provides evidence\-based online and in\-person education to veterinary professionals, pet professionals, animal welfare communities, and pet owners to prevent and help alleviate fear, anxiety, and stress in pets.  Since its launch, Fear Free has provided more than 490,000 hours of free continuing education, with over 82,000 individuals registered and 54,000 certified through their courses. FearFree claims to be “one of the single most transformative initiatives in the history of companion animal practice”, and Fear Free certification is now commonplace as a mark of assurance for pet owners seeking veterinary care. Mills’ research has both informed FearFree’s standpoint on best practice for minimising animal distress and been translated into FearFree training content and pet owner recommendations.  Both the Founder/CEO of FearFree and their Head of Research state that “ *Professor Mills’ research in clinical animal behaviour has been central in cementing a position on the value of pheromonatherapy. Most powerfully, his research demonstrating that dogs are less stressed when exposed to dog appeasing pheromones in the veterinary clinic and during travel have been fundamental in Fear Free advocating for Pheromonatherapy as an integral part of good veterinary practice, and his many other research publications in this field underpin many of the recommendations on good pet owner practices for preventing and alleviating fear, anxiety and stress and creating Fear Free Happy Home environments \(fearfreehappyhomes.com\)……Professor Mills’ work on pheromonatherapy has shaped our organisational standpoint and educational content engaged with across the world*.” **\[5.9\].** 

 In summary, University of Lincoln research led by Professor Mills has had both broad and deep impact on the development and adoption of new demonstrably effective methods for the management of stress that have improved animal well\-being and secured the commercial success of related products with evidence\-based claims.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 As evidenced by the SARS\-CoV\-2 pandemic, pathogenic viruses represent a major global threat to human health and wellbeing. Over the last decade, Bangor research has developed a range of analytical tools, technologies and models for the effective surveillance of harmful viruses in the wider environment, leading to risk\-based industry standards. Working in partnership with UK and devolved governments, our wastewater\-based surveillance tools have been adopted, piloted and rolled out at the national scale: \(a\) for whole\-community monitoring of COVID\-19 incidence, \(b\) to provide an early warning system to protect critical national infrastructure from SARS\-CoV\-2 outbreaks, \(c\) as a decision support tool to show which city areas should be targeted for mass testing, and \(d\) to evaluate the success of COVID\-19 mitigation measures. 
","
###  2. Underpinning research 

 The COVID\-19 pandemic will shape this generation. It has highlighted how viruses can severely disrupt society, community wellbeing and at the time of writing is responsible for the loss of 121,000 lives in the UK. Over the last decade, research at Bangor has developed a range of quantitative analytical and modelling tools to enable the tracking of human pathogenic viruses for public health surveillance and risk assessment purposes. This is exemplified by Bangor’s work on the identification of novel betacoronaviruses in animal reservoirs \[3.1\], the metaviromic characterisation of viral communities in the environment \[3.2, 3.a\], and quantitative determination of viruses in a range of environmental matrices, including human sewage, river water, sediments, estuaries, coastal waters and food \[3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.a\-3.l\]. Meeting this research need has been strongly driven and financially supported by industry \(e.g. water companies, food producers, shellfisheries\), local authorities and government agencies \(e.g. Food Standards Agency, Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Public Health Wales, Department of Health and Social Care\) as well as by a wide range of large UKRI and EU grants \[3.a\-3.l\]. 

 The UK produces 10,000,000,000 litres of sewage each day. This wastewater represents one of the main routes by which harmful viruses can enter the environment. Bangor University work has revealed that many harmful viruses of national importance \(e.g. Norovirus, Rotavirus, Hepatitis A/E\) are present in very high abundance in both untreated and treated sewage \(10<sup>6</sup>\-10<sup>9</sup> viral particles per litre\), particularly during localized disease outbreaks \[3.3, 3.5, 3.d, 3.e, 3.j\]. Human contact with sewage therefore poses a major risk to public health. Bangor’s research provided early evidence that viral monitoring of wastewater may provide a cheap, unbiased and effective tool to monitor levels of infection in a whole community. This approach proved particularly suitable for viral diseases which frequently don’t result in hospitalization \(i.e. not reported\), but which Public Health England estimate cost the UK economy GBP200,000,000 per year in terms of loss of working days and health care \(e.g. Norovirus\) \[3.3\]. 

 Bangor University’s research has also shown that, in contrast to faecal bacteria, many pathogenic viruses are not effectively removed by conventional sewage treatment, inevitably leading to their release and accumulation in important environmental reservoirs where human contact can occur \(e.g. sediments, bathing waters, beaches, shellfish\) \[3.2, 3.5, 3.6, 3.a, 3.e\]. Working directly with water companies, the research showed that Norovirus release in both untreated and treated sewage can lead to a rapid accumulation of Norovirus in shellfish, and that the virus can remain infectious even after light cooking \[3.5, 3.a, 3.b, 3.c\]. This led to work with EU agencies to alter legislation designed to protect bathing and shellfish waters, so that it also captured the risk posed by enteric viruses. Support for this came from an industry\-funded critical review of the risk of Norovirus infection from the consumption of shellfish using epidemiological data \[3.f\]: our analysis revealed that 16% \(11,800 cases/year\) of food\-borne Norovirus outbreaks were attributed to the consumption of oysters between 1992 and 2014. Critical to the introduction of viral standards, however, are the validation of methods that enable accurate quantification of infectious viral particles in environmental matrices. A range of methods to distinguish between infective and non\-infective \(damaged\) Norovirus particles were therefore developed \[3.3\] and in collaboration with the EU, water companies and industry bodies \(e.g. Shellfish Association of Great Britain, Seafish, Food Standards Agency\) to ensure that proposed changes to the legislation were robust \[3.e, 3.f\]. 

 Most recently, partnering with the Food Standards Agency \(FSA\), a hydrodynamically\-driven risk modelling tool was developed which takes key information \(including sewage discharge, river flow, weather and tidal patterns\) to predict, in real\-time, the likelihood of viral contamination in the coastal zone \[3.g\]. This *active management* tool is now under testing by the FSA as a mechanism to reduce the risk of shellfish contamination, reduce food\-borne outbreaks and subsequent community transmission, and protect the livelihoods of UK shellfisheries valued at GBP20,000,000 per annum. 

 At the start of the COVID\-19 pandemic Bangor researchers, led by Professor D. Jones, identified that faecal shedding of SARS\-CoV\-2 into wastewater could be used to provide an unbiased estimate of the prevalence of COVID\-19 within an entire community \[3.6\]. Building on the novel methodologies developed for quantifying and sequencing \(by metaviromics\) human pathogenic viruses in water and shellfish \[3.2, 3.3\], viral surveillance approaches to track SARS\-CoV\-2 in major UK cities \(e.g. Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff\) was rapidly adapted and deployed. In the first COVID\-19 wave Bangor research showed that viral levels in sewage accurately reflected cases in the wider community, validating the approach. In addition, the Bangor team developed novel human faecal markers \(e.g. CrAssphage\) to allow for normalisation for external factors such as wastewater flow and dilution \[3.4\]. Further, through quantitative risk assessment and infectivity screening together with Welsh Water and United Utilities we showed that the risk of contracting SARS\-CoV\-2 through environmental routes involving wastewater and biosolids contamination was extremely low \[3.l\]. The Bangor team also worked with the NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility to develop new sequencing methods for SARS\-CoV\-2 in wastewater allowing the Department of Health and Social Care \(DHSC\) to identify and quantify the abundance of SARS\-CoV\-2 variants circulating in the population. After the first COVID\-19 wave Bangor developed enhanced high\-throughput methods for viral extraction from wastewater allowing rapid scaling up of the technology. This led to the establishment of the national wastewater\-based surveillance programme run by the DHSC. Our COVID\-19 work was supported by 3 UKRI grants and 3 grants from government agencies \(DHSC, Defra and Welsh Government\) totalling GPB2,800,000 \[3.i, 3.j\]. Bangor’s research provided key evidence to SAGE and Welsh Government’s Technical Advisory Group of COVID\-19.

###  4. Details of the impact 

####  a\) Industry standards for shellfish in relation to Norovirus 

 Bangor’s research into microbial pathogen transport in catchments and estuaries has stimulated initiation, and informed direction of, regulatory development work undertaken by regulators \(Food Standards Agency \[FSA\], Environment Agency \[EA\]\) and industry \(Seafish, Shellfish Association of Great Britain \[SAGB\]\), on potential for risk\-based assurance schemes for shellfish, linking environmental risk predictors \(e.g. rainfall\) to temporal controls of shellfish harvesting. 

 Accumulation of human enteric pathogens in filter\-feeding shellfish is a potential human health risk that is regulated through monitoring of *E. coli* as an indicator of faecal contamination. This is a significant regulatory burden for industry, with periods of poor water quality leading to restrictions on harvesting or closure of production areas. In 2016, Professor Le Vay chaired a large stakeholder meeting \(industry, FSA, EA, Public Health England, Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science\) investigating industry concerns about the regulatory system, following an unprecedented and unexplained high *E. coli* event and closure of shellfish production across SW England. Bangor’s fundamental research into the processes governing the transport and fate of viruses and bacteria in coastal waters and shellfish receptors \[3.d\-3.f\] was then used by the FSA to devise a policy roadmap and new active management systems for minimising shellfish contamination and public health risk. The Director of Operations at Seafish reported “without doubt the underpinning research and support provided by Bangor University has been... instrumental in driving change and improvements across the shellfish regulatory and production landscape” \[5.1\]. 

 Professor Le Vay provided science advice to the UK Shellfish Stakeholders Working Group \(SSWG\), a UK\-wide body formed to address industry concerns about impacts of frequent closures and public\-health downgrades of shellfish production areas. This led to Bangor being commissioned to undertake a full\-scale proof of concept of adaptive management of shellfish waters \(Developing an Assurance Scheme for Shellfish and Human Health – DASSHH \[3.g\]\) and advising Seafish \(Le Vay, Seafish Expert Panel\) and FSA, in review of potential for changes to regulation of shellfish waters. Based on this work, the development of a risk\-based approach to the classification of shellfish production waters via DASSHH was identified as a critical action in the English Aquaculture Strategy 2020 \(Le Vay is member of Seafood 2040, Aquaculture Leaders Group\) \[5.1, 5.2\]. 

 Half of EU aquaculture production comes from live bivalve shellfish, with a value of over €1200,000,000 \(01\-2016\), supporting over 8000 companies and over 60,000 jobs. Bangor research focused on detecting and quantifying pathogenic viruses in various environmental and animal matrices including wastewater and shellfish. It also highlighted the inability of the approved Norovirus testing method to discriminate between active and inactive virus leading to inaccurate quantification of Norovirus in environmental samples. This work informed effective industry rebuttal of amendments to Regulation \(EC\) 854/2004 to include statutory limits for Norovirus in shellfish harvested for human consumption \(tabled in 2015\). This helped secure thousands of jobs and live shellfish to continue to be sold safely to the market by avoiding a projected 50% reduction in sales during winter months over 5 years \[5.3\]. 

####  b\) National scale surveillance of SARS\-CoV\-2: informing government and agency planning to protect public health 

 Bangor’s research directly led to the creation and implementation of the national wastewater surveillance programme for tracing COVID\-19 in the UK \[5.4, 5.5, 5.6\]. This programme is run by UK Government via the Joint Biosecurity Centre, Department of Health and Social Care and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. UK Government has invested over GBP40,000,000 into the programme. It directly supports decision making \(e.g. success of non\-pharmaceutical interventions; NPIs\) and the targeting of resources in the *Test and Trace* programme \(e.g. where to deploy surge testing\). Bangor provided the proof\-of\-concept and validated viral analysis methods which were subsequently adopted by the national programme \[5.4\]. Defra’s Project Manager reported that ‘ *Bangor University’s work has significantly impacted our work as part of the national response to COVID\-19’,* adding that the ‘ *Pioneering research of Bangor University early in the pandemic formed the basis of the establishment of the English national COVID\-19 Wastewater Monitoring Programme’* and that the Programme’s success has depended on the *‘early engagement with the* \[Defra\] *Programme team to understand and embed policy response needs into Bangor’s research service at the outset, coupled with clear communication of progress and codesign of solutions to complex or sensitive issues surrounding handling of the pandemic response’* \[5.4\] *.* 

 In the period Aug\-Dec 2020, the national programme has provided near real\-time information on levels of SARS\-CoV\-2 circulating in all the major towns and cities in the UK \(4 samples/week at 44 core sites\) \[5.4\]. This is used to evaluate the success of NPIs and also to track the spread of newly emerged variants of concern in the UK \(e.g. Lineage B.1.1.7., Kent variant\). Viral analysis was undertaken jointly by the Environment Agency and Bangor University laboratories. The Director General for the Joint Biosecurity Centre, UK reported that Bangor’s Wastewater programme enabled them “to respond to sometimes rapidly emerging situations as part of our national Test & Trace Efforts” confirming that the Bangor team made “a very critical difference at this time of national crisis” \[5.6\]. 

 In addition, wastewater testing in the suburbs of 20 UK cities \(in\-sewer monitoring\) has been used to directly inform decision making on a local scale. Together with United Utilities and the Department of Health and Social Care, Bangor undertook the pilot programme in Liverpool where data was collected from 8 suburbs and the information used to geographically target surge testing and introduce non\-pharmaceutical interventions. Following the pilot, it was subsequently rolled out to all major UK cities \[5.4\]. 

 Bangor is the central analysis laboratory for the Department of Health and Social Care’s critical infrastructure COVID\-19 prevention programme which aims to protect national supply chains. This programme collects wastewater from 25 key industrial facilities \(e.g. meat processing plants, distribution depots\) daily and reports within 24 hours on levels of COVID\-19 incidence within the workforce. This has successfully identified COVID\-19 outbreaks within the workforce, followed by surge testing to identify infected individuals and the introduction of effective control measures. 

 In addition to SARS\-CoV\-2 the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales have used the Bangor laboratories to monitor other infectious diseases of public health concern \(e.g. influenza A/B, Respiratory syncytial virus, Enterovirus D68\) to inform planning \[5.5\]. Professor D. Jones chairs the Welsh Government COVID technical advice group and sits on the UK Parliament SAGE sub\-committee, Transmission in the Wider Environment which has produced many guidance documents to UK and Welsh Government on COVID\-19 related environment issues and its mitigation, including those associated with wastewater. The Chief Scientific Advisor for Health in Wales reported that Bangor’s research “has had a major impact on Welsh Government’s response to Covid\-19”, and added that “the epidemiological analysis enabled by this work has provided vital insights to Welsh Government…..Ministers to inform the response to Covid\-19” \[5.5\].

 **1. Summary of the impact** \(indicative maximum\) 

 Research undertaken by the Applied Optics Group \(AOG\) in the School of Physical Sciences \(SPS\) at the University of Kent has provided the impetus for new commercial developments in Optical Coherence Tomography \(OCT\) and enabled the exploitation of broadband lasers for medical diagnostics. In both cases, novel diagnostic instruments were developed, which are now routinely used in clinics. Instruments building on *en\-face* OCT technology \(in particular the AngioVue and the Solix developed by Optovue\) enable better management of conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, age\-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. This now benefits millions of people across the world. Laser technology, in turn, has improved skin cancer diagnostics for thousands at Bispebjerg Hospital \(Denmark\). Through knowledge transfer and collaborations with the AOG, four different companies that are involved in developing medical diagnostic instruments have directly benefited. NKT \(a world\-leading niche market company for supercontinuum lasers\), for example, has gained improved access to the OCT market \(worth $1bn USD\). 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** \(indicative maximum 500 words\) 

 The diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions ranging from glaucoma to skin cancer relies on accurate imaging technologies. The University of Kent’s Applied Optics Group \(AOG\) is generating and advancing the knowledge behind such technologies. AOG research is twofold, focusing on the development of *en\-face* OCT on the one hand, and the exploitation of laser technology for the advancement of OCT on the other. 

 **Strand 1: **en\-face** OCT** 

 The AOG is at the forefront of fundamental research into Optical Coherence Tomography \(OCT\). By the early 2000s, OCT was widely accepted as a paradigm\-changing methodology in ophthalmology, but could not yet be fully exploited. To address this issue, work at Kent since 2000 developed platforms for multiple parallel imaging channels, which made the new OCT method easier to understand, provided *en\-face* high\-resolution imaging in real time, and led to the development of OCT/SLO \( *en\-face* confocal scanning ophthalmoscopy\). Pioneering Kent instrumentation **\[P1\]** provided a new method for detecting the appearance of eye lesions, which changed the paradigm and methodology of image\-based diagnostics. Features from OCT and conventional confocal images could now be matched to assess the lateral extent of various retinal lesions crucial to sight, which led to simpler and more effective diagnosis. Commercial versions of the OCT/SLO *en\-face* instrument were being developed by all major OCT manufacturers from 2008 onwards. 

 Research by AOG since 2003 further demonstrated that clinical OCT and angiography data from patients can be acquired and viewed simultaneously in the *en\-face* mode **\[R1\]**. This paved the way for the development of OCT Angiography \(OCTA\). Clinicians currently regard OCTA as the method of choice alongside OCT reflectance imaging. OCTA enables non\-invasive examinations of the structural, vascular, and functional features of the retina by using the *en\-face* OCT orientation to demonstrate correlations between structural and functional information. 

 **Strand 2: OCT and laser technology** 

 Two key challenges of OCT imaging were the pursuit of better depth resolution and imaging in different spectral bands, both of which could ultimately be overcome through utilising supercontinuum lasers. Supercontinuum lasers emit broadband radiation, which improves resolution but generates noise. The AOG’s research since 2009 improved noise performance of supercontinuum lasers, known for their broadband spectral emission **\[R2, R3\]**, thus making them a contender for the more established swept lasers to power OCT instrumentation in clinical dermatology **\[R4\]**. Since 2013, the AOG has been collaborating with NKT Photonics Ltd \(a world leader in high\-performance fibre lasers and photonic crystal fibres\) to advance knowledge and to enable NKT to progress supercontinuum technology to ultra\-high\-resolution OCT and photoacoustics. The latter complements the multimodal aspects that can be addressed with supercontinuum sources. Through the collaboration with NKT, supercontinuum lasers, which are required by the OCT community for low\-noise, high\-axial resolution, as well as to build the next generation of versatile multi\-modality imagers with high\-power broadband emission, were developed **\[R2, R3, R4\]**. 

 Since 2015, and in collaboration with the Danish Technical University \(DTU\) and NKT, Professor Podoleanu, a co\-investigator for ShapeOCT, further helped to drive gains in the OCT performance of supercontinuum sources, demonstrating the fastest OCT at new spectral limits in the mid\-infrared \(4 m\) **\[R5\]**.

 **4. Details of the impact** \(indicative maximum 750 words\) 

 The advancement of *en\-face* and laser technology by the University of Kent’s AOG has led to: \(1\) impact on commerce and the economy \(for OPTOS, NKT, Optovue, DTU/Norblis\); \(2\) impact on health and wellbeing, with millions of people benefiting from advancements in *en\-face* OCT and several thousand people benefiting from enhanced laser technology. 

 **Advancing **en\-face** OCT: Development of new medical devices, driving diagnostic standards and improving identification and treatment of occult diseases** 

 In 2011, OPTOS bought OPKO and thus acquired Kent’s OCT/SLO, the first combined Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopes \(SLO\) and OCT instruments designed to provide retinal images in the *en\-face* orientation for the diagnosis of eye diseases **\[P1\]**. *En\-face* gradually became the standard imaging modality in hospitals \(with competitors such as Zeiss and Optovue also having started to develop *en\-face* orientation technology\). OPTOS continued to sell the original OCT/SLO device to clinics around the world until 2016 **\[a\]**. As part of its R&D plan, OPTOS continues to maintain many of the ‘two dozen patents and patent applications \[protecting the original OCT/SLO technology, which name Kent inventors\]’ **\[a\]**. 

 The collaboration between the University of Kent’s AOG and Rosen **\[R1\]**, Vice\-Chair of Ophthalmology Research, Surgeon Director at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary \(NYEEI\), advanced *en\-face* OCT technology further still, and led to OCTA being implemented in the clinical context. OCTA offers additional benefits because it is the first non\-invasive imaging technique that enables visualisation of vascular networks in the human retina, choroid, skin, etc. Since 2015, this ‘landmark discovery’ **\[b, c\]** has enabled an even ‘more accurate identification of occult diseases’ **\[b\]**. OCTA has ‘revolutionized the clinician’s access to non\-invasive 3\-dimensional vascular beds as a quantitative tool for management of diabetic retinopathy, age\-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma’ **\[b\]**. This is significant, given how widespread these diseases are. The projected number of people with age\-related macular degeneration alone is 196 million in 2020, increasing to 288 million in 2040. 

 OCTA has inspired other groups across the globe to develop similar instruments, thus making multimodal images a new standard in the field **\[b\]**. Rosen further states that Prof. Podoleanu’s work ‘has inspired a whole new generation of young clinicians’ **\[b\]**, and that it ‘has been a crucial stimulus for our own research and clinical missions at NYEEI\_MS as well as our partner organizations’ **\[b\]**. The joint work between the University of Kent’s AOG and the NYEEI ‘has helped to improve the diagnosis prospects for millions of patients since we began in 2000 to the current day’ **\[b\]**. 

 The CEO at Optovue, an industry\-leading ophthalmic company based in California, has also testified to the importance of the AOG’s work. With regards to product development and determining a business strategy, the company has been ‘guided by the enface OCT images and the combined display of enface OCT with angiography images initially demonstrated by Podoleanu and Rosen’ **\[c\]**. Optovue became the first company to launch and commercialise OCTA instruments, and started to sell their AngioVue instrument in 2014. ‘This was a major change in our market strategy that paid off, with the AngioVue installed in more than 1600 ophthalmic practices worldwide’ **\[c\]**. It is estimated that one machine can diagnose 1,000 patients per year, meaning that 1.6 million people were benefiting from the AngioVue on an annual basis by 2020. By 2020, Optovue had in addition to this launched Solix, another new OCTA machine that comes with increased scanning speed. ‘Solix is the latest in a range of OCTA instruments which we have been commercialising since 2014, and which owe their existence to the original discovery work of the en\-face imaging collaboration of Prof. Adrian Podoleanu and Dr Richard Rosen since 2000.’ **\[c\]** 

 Furthermore, Centervue has ‘contributed to the costs for prosecution of the patents protecting Kent’s Master Slave OCT’, a powerful and paradigm\-changing technology that enables direct *en\-face* real\-time displays **\[d\]**, showing that significant interest in the exploitation of AOG\-developed technology is continuing. 

 **OCT and laser technology: improving skin cancer diagnostics** 

 Sustained and increasing collaboration between the AOG and NKT Photonics has increased NKT’s understanding of the OCT market, and since 2014 helped to steer research at NKT **\[e\]**. Senior Research Scientist Patrick Bowman stated that joint research programs are important not only because they ‘drive state\-of\-the\-art research into next\-gen lasers for OCT’ **\[e\]**, but also because they enable the company to receive knowledge with regards to how to improve products and indications as to which technical improvements to lasers will be important to OCT in the future. ‘As a niche laser supplier, with a small revenue compared to the overall size of the OCT market, the latter is critical for NKT to decide whether or not to compete in certain areas’ **\[e\]**. 

 Joint work between the AOG and NKT provided NKT with a unique commercial advantage, enabling them ‘to progress the supercontinuum technology to ultra\-high resolution optical coherence tomography’ **\[e\]**. As a consequence, NKT could enhance their lasers and improve their access to the OCT market valued at $1bn USD **\[e\]**. In parallel, AOG, NKT, and the Danish Technical University \(DTU\) advanced the technology of photo\-acoustics **\[e\]**. This is another significant, growing market. ‘To give estimates, the value of photo\-acoustic imaging in its pre\-clinical stage in 2018 was $35M USD. Now on the cusp of wide\- spread clinical testing, it is estimated to reach a market value of $240M USD by 2022’ **\[e\]**. 

 Collaborations between the AOG, DTU, and NKT have led to the training of 5 PhD students \(2014\-18\) in an industrial setting, and enabled NKT ‘to extend our collaborators to OPTOS and G&H, and clinical practitioners such as Northwick Park Hospital, London and Moorfields Eye Hospital \(Institute of Ophthalmology\), London’, as well as various hospitals in Denmark **\[e\]**. Ear, Nose, and Throat surgeons at Northwick Park have benefited from ‘having the opportunity to directly guide the development of new technology to suit requirements for some of our surgical interventions’, while ‘Post\-doctorate and PhD students have been hosted both from The University of Kent and Imperial College London as part of our Trust’s applied optical imaging programme’ **\[h\]**. It also led DTU ‘to pay more attention to the OCT field’ **\[g\]**, to continue collaborating with Podoleanu and the AOG, to diversify their involvement with OCT, and to create their spin\-out company Norblis \(2018\), which makes imaging equipment using broadband lasers in mid\-IR **\[g\]**. 

 The most significant clinical impact resulting from the various collaborations between AOG and DTU was achieved with Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 Epilepsy surgery can dramatically improve quality of life for some children with severe uncontrolled epilepsy, who endure continued unpredictable seizures, often multiple times a day. Research led by clinical scientists at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health \(GOS ICH\) has led to a care pathway now applied across Europe, to identify suitable cases. The UCL team has established a centralised epilepsy surgery service for children in England that since 2013, has seen a three\-fold increase in the number of children benefitting from surgery across 4 UK centres. In 2019, 345 children were treated in the UK and 85% of them are now seizure free. The team has also developed freely available MRI processing software for clinicians to identify candidates for surgery and established a European Specialist Network that is increasing awareness and availability of epilepsy surgery across Europe. 
","
 **2. Underpinning research** 

 Epilepsy affects 112,000 children and young people in the UK. Two thirds of patients will respond to antiepileptic medication or go into spontaneous remission. However, for 1 in 3 patients, seizures persist despite medication and many experience more than 30 seizures per day. This can have a devastating impact on families with patients experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems in addition to multiple seizures that impact quality of life and can result in injury. Research in the UCL GOS ICH Developmental Neurosciences department has been instrumental in developing ways to target surgical interventions to ensure more patients can live seizure free. These include validating functional imaging to relate brain abnormalities to areas of seizure onset, as well as delineate areas of function that should be preserved in surgery, and highlighting improvements post\-surgery in cognitive function with long term follow up. 

 More recently, the UCL team has made improvements to structural MRI methodology and developed freely available machine learning software to support clinicians in identifying cases. They have used advanced neurophysiology to determine where seizures may arise and demonstrated the link between early medication weaning post\-surgery and improvements in cognitive function. 

 **Identifying the link between EEG and structural brain abnormalities associated with epilepsy** 

 Focal cortical dysplasia \(FCD\), an abnormality of cortical development, is the leading cause of surgically remediable drug\-resistant epilepsy in children. Despite high\-resolution MRI, post\-operative histological studies demonstrate that 50\-80% of FCD cases escape routine visual inspection. Incomplete resection of such lesions during surgery significantly reduces the chance that seizures will cease. To help correlate any structural abnormality with the electrical activity confirming the seizure onset zone, the UCL team have developed combined EEG\-functional MRI \(EEGfMRI\) to link electrical activity to structural brain abnormalities and thus determine the source of the seizures \( **R1**\). They have also performed correlative advanced electrophysiological studies \(electrical source imaging \[ESI and EEGfMRI\]\) in children with focal onset seizures to improve the yield of location of responsible brain tissue \( **R2**\). This is providing increased confidence in determining which patients would benefit from surgery \( **R3**\). 

 **Machine learning tools to identify surgical cases** 

 The UCL team has developed several automated MRI analysis methods for the detection of subtle focal brain lesions. They have identified novel local morphological features allowing them to localise FCD lesions by developing cortical feature maps based on a machine learning method using artificial neural networks \( **R4**\). In collaboration with 26 European clinical centres, the team continues to develop freely available ‘post\-processing’ machine learning tools for structural MRI \(MELD consortium,  [https://meldproject.github.io](https://meldproject.github.io/)\). These tools have now been independently validated in three patient cohorts in the UK, US and China \( **R5**\). 

 **Cognitive benefits post\-surgery** 

 Outcome studies from many centres worldwide demonstrate the long\-term benefits of early surgery with regard to seizure freedom, but its impact on cognitive development has been unclear. The UCL team previously showed that the earlier the onset of epilepsy, the poorer cognitive performance in the longer term. More recently, they demonstrated that cognition is maintained in the short\-term following surgery, but improvements in IQ are seen in longer follow\-up assessments. Improvements are highly related to seizure freedom and weaning of medication as well as site of surgery and simultaneous cortical growth \( **R6**\). The team were integral to the design and data collection for a large pan\-European study \(TimeToStop cognitive outcomes study group\) of over 300 children who had undergone surgery to treat epileptic seizures. This study provides further evidence for a link between early weaning from medication post\-surgery and improvements in IQ \( **R7**\).

 **4. Details of the impact** 

 Approximately 35,000 children and young people in the UK experience severe uncontrolled epilepsy that is associated with a reduced quality of life and around 440 children each year could benefit from surgery. Clinical scientists at UCL GOS ICH led developments in MRI scanning that are now incorporated into international guidelines and help clinicians to identify children who will benefit from surgery, to reduce epileptic seizures and improve cognitive outcomes. In 2019, 345 children in the UK were treated with surgery and 85% of them have subsequently stopped having seizures completely. In addition, the UCL team has developed open access training tools and established international expert networks that mean in Europe many more children and young adults can now gain access to and benefit from epilepsy surgery. 

 **Consensus recommendations for epilepsy surgery** 

 The UCL GOS ICH team has led international initiatives to establish benchmarks and standards for epilepsy surgery in childhood. In 2014, Professor Cross led on a consensus document published by the International League Against Epilepsy \(ILAE\) on diagnostic techniques for use in presurgical evaluation in children. The published care pathway is now utilised worldwide as standard \( **S1**\). Cross was also part of the expert group selected by the ILAE that developed best practice recommendations for epilepsy surgery procedures to maximise chances of seizure control and help minimise cognitive deficits \( **S2**\) **.** 

 Developments from UCL research are now embedded in new standards for paediatric epilepsy surgery centres worldwide, which state: “Level 1 care consists of children age 9 years and older, with discrete lesions including hippocampal sclerosis, undergoing lobectomy or lesionectomy, preferably on the cerebral convexity and not close to eloquent cortex, by a team … with access to video\-electroencephalography and 1.5\-T magnetic resonance imaging \(MRI\). Level 2 care, also encompassing Level 1 care, occurs across the age span and range of etiologies … associated with MRI lesions that may be ill\-defined, multilobar, hemispheric, or multifocal, and includes children with normal MRI or foci in/abutting eloquent cortex. Available Level 2 technologies includes 3\-T MRI, other advanced magnetic resonance technology including functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging \(tractography\), positron emission tomography and/or single photon emission computed tomography, source localization with electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography, and the ability to perform intra\- or extraoperative invasive monitoring and functional mapping.”\( **S3**\). 

 **Open access software to support clinical assessment and selection for epilepsy surgery.** 

 Since 2013, the UCL team has initiated a multi\-centre effort to develop a large training data set \- the ‘Multi\-centre Epilepsy Lesion Detection’ \(MELD\) project \( **S4**\) that uses software tools developed at UCL to support identification of suitable cases for surgery. The consortium continues to contribute scan data to further develop the tools for lesion detection and normalisation techniques, through machine learning. The MELD cohort currently comprises over 550 FCD patients and 382 controls, with 26 participating centres internationally, including in Brazil, China, Finland, Spain and US. Participating sites use their own data for clinical planning comparing it to data from collaborating centres and allowing them to identify more patients suitable for epilepsy surgery who would have been missed using standard clinical evaluation \( **S4**\). The President of the American Epilepsy Society said, “This program has been at the forefront of investigation and advances that have demonstrated improved outcomes of paediatric epilepsy surgery in addition advocating for epilepsy surgery in children. Critical to success has been a series of elegant studies that have improved and broadened patient selection for epilepsy surgery, delineated benefits of surgery on seizure control and cognition, and introduced techniques and technology that have improved outcomes. Among these projects is MELD, an initiative that has organized collaboration of leading epilepsy centres from across the globe \(including our centre\), that has provided novel insights into the location and epileptogenic potential of focal cortical dysplasia \(FCD\)” \( **S5**\). 

 **Increasing the number of children benefiting from epilepsy surgery** 

 The UCL GOS ICH research has highlighted the value in increasing epilepsy surgery as an intervention for severe epilepsy, demonstrating that early surgery and subsequent weaning from medication can arrest cognitive decline and estimating that up to 440 children per year in England would benefit. The team has campaigned for change, driving the development of the Children’s Epilepsy Surgery Service \(CESS\), established in 2012 and to which Professor Cross remains clinical advisor \( **S6**\). Since 2013, CESS has supported a three\-fold increase in the number of children being assessed for and receiving epilepsy surgery in England. In 2019, 345 children were treated with surgery and 85% of them have stopped having seizures completely, with many discontinuing drug therapy, thereby arresting a progressive decline in IQ and educational attainment. 

 Cross co\-led a successful bid to establish a European Union funded pilot network for epilepsy surgery – “E\-pilepsy”, to increase awareness and availability of epilepsy surgery across Europe. In 2016, Cross instigated the Reference Network for Rare and Complex Epilepsies \(EpiCARE\) with further EU funding. This is a network of 52 specialist health care providers/centres and a further 15 affiliated centres across 24 countries who work together to provide specialist advice on treatments for complex epilepsy cases. ‘E\-pilepsy’ remains the surgical arm of EpiCARE. A care pathway exists for referral of patients into the pathway for discussion \( **S7**\). The Chair of the European Epilepsy Network said: “Their \[Cross and Baldeweg’s\] work in advancing imaging options and outcomes has widened the spectrum of children suitable for surgery and established epilepsy surgery as an early management option in selected candidates, improving long term outcomes in these children… There is no question that the UCL group remain at the forefront of defining the selection and benefits of epilepsy surgery in children and have enhanced the awareness and availability throughout Europe and more globally.” **\(S8\).** 

 The group meets virtually, twice a month to discuss 2\-4 cases. A surgical case considered by the network was used for a video to advertise the work and success of the European Reference Networks overall, demonstrating how a boy of 5 years of age in Finland with a rare epilepsy related to a specific benign brain tumour, hypothalamic hamartoma, was brought for discussion with centres in the network and ultimately went to Marseille for specialised treatment \( **S9**\). This film won a silver dolphin award at the Cannes film festival in 2019. The patient’s father said: “Thanks to this network, my son’s doctor was able to seek advice from the best specialists and they were able to work out the best treatment for my son.”
