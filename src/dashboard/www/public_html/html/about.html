<h4>The SHAPE of Impact Project</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> British Academy </a>and the<a
        href="https://acss.org.uk/" target="_blank">Academy of Social Sciences </a>commissioned researchers from the<a
        href="https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science </a>at the
    University of Oxford to examine and uncover <i>“the stories, successes and cumulative effects on people, the
        economy, policy and society of the impact of research in the SHAPE disciplines (Social Sciences, Humanities and
        the Arts for People and the Economy/Environment)”</i> within the United Kingdom’s <a
            href="https://www.ref.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> Research Excellence Framework of 2021 (REF2021)</a>. The
    project was tendered via a competitive process to provide a robust evidence base for the higher education sector and
    policymakers to articulate the value of research and its impact on society in the UK and around the world. The
    report – and this accompanying online dashboard – aims to serve as a starting point for the SHAPE community to
    explore the scope and reach of the evidence base. Please read our

    results.</p>

<p>This work leverages the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 Impact Case Study (ICS) dataset to reveal new
    insights about the contribution of SHAPE to the wellbeing of society, culture and the economy. The REF is the UK’s
    system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education providers, with results used to inform the
    distribution of approximately £2 billion per year of public funding for universities’ research. The publication of
    impact case studies presents an opportunity for the research community to demonstrate the broader footprint of their
    published research and to recognise the achievements and successes of research across the UK.</p>

<p>We develop a novel mixed-method approach that combines in-depth narrative interviews (N=48) to reveal the stories and
    successes of the impact of research as well as a questionnaire to SHAPE panel members (N=263) with the most advanced
    machine learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify key topical clusters of SHAPE impact. We
    focus on ICS submitted within SHAPE disciplines, in the Social Sciences (Panel C, N=2,146), Arts and Humanities
    (Panel D, N=1,528) and Psychology, Psychiatry and Neuroscience (Unit of Assessment 4, N=528), sometimes in
    comparison to other non-SHAPE disciplines (total ICS N=6,361). We supplement the REF2021 ICS database with newly
    engineered fields, our topic models, the scientometric Dimensions database, REF environment, and REF quality
    databases. The project was overseen by a steering group consisting of representatives from business, academia, major
    funders, and Fellows of the British Academy and the Academy of Social Sciences. </p>
