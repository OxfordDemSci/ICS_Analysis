<h5>The SHAPE of Research Impact</h5>

<p>This dashboard allows you to explore the stories, successes and cumulative
    societal benefits of UK research in SHAPE disciplines: <i>Social Sciences, Humanities and the Arts for People and
        the Economy/Environment.</i></p>

<p>Discover research that you find most exciting from thousands of Impact Case Studies
    submitted to the United Kingdom's Research Excellence Framework of 2021.</p>

<p>We used state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing to group Impact Case Studies in 82 distinct
    topics, as well as grouping topics into broad clusters.</p>

<p>You are currently viewing results for all Impact Case Studies from SHAPE disciplines. Select a topic from the
    left panel to filter results to only Impact Case Studies within that topic. Click funders, main assessment
    panels, or geographies to further refine the results.

<p>Browse our Enhanced REF Database (bottom-left) to view and download details about all of the Impact Case Studies
    that match your currently selected filters.</p>
