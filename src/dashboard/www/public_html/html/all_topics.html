<h5>The SHAPE of Research Impact</h5>

<p>This dashboard allows you to explore the stories, successes and cumulative
    societal benefits of UK research in SHAPE disciplines: <i>Social Sciences, Humanities and the Arts for People and
        the Economy.</i></p>

<p>Discover research that you find most exciting from thousands of Impact Case Studies
    submitted to the United Kingdom's Research Excellence Framework of 2021.</p>

<p>The results shown in this dashboard are based on a joint machine-learning and human feedback approach which applied 
    state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing to group Impact Case Studies into 84 distinct topics, as well as grouping 
    topics into broad clusters.</p>

<p>Select a topic from the left panel to filter results to only Impact Case Studies within that topic. Click funders, main assessment
    panels, units of assessment, or geographies of research institutions or beneficiaries to further refine the results.

<p>Browse our Enhanced REF Database (bottom-left) to view and download details about all of the Impact Case Studies
    that match your currently selected filters.</p>
